Q appears to want us to push this hash tag: #internetbillofrights. https://t.co/3QiuaWQ2G0\\n7.  Q responds to an anon who had concerns about IBOR. Q clarifies 1st Amendment can\\'t be enforced upon private companies. Yes, they risk losing cash but Clowns make up for it (e.g. OUR TAX PAYER DOLLARS!). There must be a way to prove that if WE are funding, we should control! https://t.co/A0P2C8gWl1\\n4. Just a theory here but IF Snowden has flipped because he is now, according to Q,  a \"liability\" to Clowns (like JP Barlow, who was 187\\'ed, became), is Q Team, w/China\\'s assistance helping him clear customs? Is Snowden evading capture by Clowns? https://t.co/nLDiYEdO7K\\n@threadreaderapp please unroll.\\n8. This anon did a great breakdown of a potential timeline for Q\\'s use of \"BOOM\" in multiple drops. Sounds plausible. We shall see what happens in the news tomorrow if the ref to \"-24\" is some kind of op (Snowden extraction from HK?) and only IF the MSM (maybe only FNC?) reports. https://t.co/L193DepFS0\\nHmmm...Q is on the hunt for @Snowden. This looks like it could be Hong Kong. I lived there from 1976-1980. A lot has changed, no doubt, but it sure looks that way. The guy in the center of the crowd could be him? https://t.co/Wh29gBoHmQ\\n3. Q tells us the #internetbillofrights has nothing to do with AT&amp;T. This scares the Clowns more than anything because they will no longer control the msg. Yes, we have the 1st Amendment &amp; yes, these are private companies BUT they are censoring conservative voices. That\\'s not OK. https://t.co/ZA921vgplV\\n5. It seems pretty clear CLOWNS control social media. Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO) likely wrote the code to censor across platforms. I\\'m guessing Russia, China, &amp; HK probably were sold this code by ES (or via HRC selling access to her unclass server?). https://t.co/rHiuN6p8JZ',\n",

Identify partners with expertise &amp; track record in your industry, not just big names, and schedule meetings 3-4 weeks out. VCs are always on \"vacation\". 5/\\nIf you don\\'t hear back from an investor in 1-2 days, they don\\'t like you. If they don\\'t ask questions, they don\\'t like you. Find one VC partner to be your champion and find out what their colleagues will want to know. 6/\\nStartup burn rates balloon to the size of your bank account if you\\'re not careful. Be thrifty. Cash should last 12-18 months until you\\'ve hit milestones that de-risk your business for a new round of funding. 9/\\nThe unintuitive secret to startup fundraising isn\\'t the pitch where everyone has their own style, but the process of lining up a ton of investor meetings back-to-back so you can play them off each other. It\\'s not the song, it\\'s the dance. 4/\\nThe best startup pitches identify a big problem, show why your product is the solution, and then prove your potential to be huge with the right team, traction, growth plan, unit economics, and adjacent markets you\\'ll conquer. 2/\\nDon\\'t write off lesser-known investors. A mid-tier fund\\'s YES beats a top dog\\'s No any day. Once you get a term sheet, don\\'t say who it\\'s from but leverage it to get offers or better deals from other investors. Don\\'t be a jerk about it. 7/\\nStartups can die waiting for an investor\\'s due diligence to finish before they get the cash. The median wait after a soft YES is 41 days. Make sure you have enough runway to survive that long. 8/\\nThe best startup tip is still \"don\\'t quit\". When investors says no, employees leave, competitors emerge, and you want to hide: have grit, pivot, survive. Here are some more strategies from Atrium. https://t.co/kMWBaUPUlr What are your best fundraising tricks? 10/10\\nPracticing your startup pitch is critical because it A/B tests narratives, unearths hard questions, and breeds confidence. No on will fund you unless you\\'re so passionate they know you won\\'t quit. 3/\\nStartup funding shouldn\\'t just go to white Ivy League Bay Area bros, so I\\'m sharing the top fundraising tips from Atrium\\'s fundraising workshop.

À dérouler ⬇️ https://t.co/cLBkPRYpIP\\nLa métaphore du loup s\\'inscrit dans une véritable #cultureduviol : l\\'homme est un prédateur sexuel, la femme une proie. Les nouvelles affiches de la #RATP (justement critiquées) contre le #harcelement sexuel ne disent pas autre chose... https://t.co/NvS0hAG6tx\\nDans l\\'esprit d\\'Abélard, ce n\\'est pas un crime : il était poussé par la folie de l\\'amour. Il va même jusqu\\'à se justifier : s\\'il a frappé Héloïse, c\\'est par amour et par tendresse. Voilà voilà. https://t.co/CvtruHXnI4\\nÉvidemment, à l\\'époque, elle ne pouvait pas. Aux historien•ne•s d\\'aujourd\\'hui de rendre justice à ces femmes violées et violentées d\\'hier, dont les souffrances sont masquées sous de belles histoires d\\'amour... Notre article du jour à retrouver : https://t.co/U2D1z5EIN9\\nMais il va même plus loin encore : dans ses lettres, Abélard dit bien qu\\'il a \"frappé et menacé\" Héloïse pour \"arracher son consentement\" alors même qu\\'elle \"résistait et ne voulait pas\". Et qu\\'il l\\'a fait \"plusieurs fois\", à chaque fois qu\\'il avait envie \"d\\'assouvir ses désirs\". https://t.co/z4EHnQy6hV\\nCar si on reprend ces lettres, qu\\'y lit-on vraiment ? D\\'abord, qu\\'il n\\'y a pas de coup de foudre : Abélard, grand séducteur, décide de conquérir Héloïse. Dans ses lettres, il se décrit lui-même comme un « loup affamé convoitant une tendre brebis ». https://t.co/FZKjqbExa1',\n",

Again, usually for problem employees — not McCabe type. I don’t find McCabe leaving earlier than planned as so crazy today. Not panicking. /4\\nWith Fast &amp; Furious, under Holder DOJ, the White House and DOJ and Holder got hit repeatedly by the Hill Republicans, and at some point, someone had to be the fall guy. It was my friend/former colleague Jason Weinstein. Jason was a long-time career prosecutor who “resigned.” /7\\nOf course not. But to me this makes the most sense as to why McCabe is fall guy, &amp; why it happened early and caught FBI and others off guard. The good news: McCabe has much more time for Mueller now. I’m not panicked. I hope you won’t be either. /END\\nI suspect new General Counsel Dana Boente worked on a settlement agreement over weekend to get McCabe to resign in return for McCabe getting to use paid administrative leave + benefits so that he won’t take financial hit. McCabe would have agreed to stop work &amp; depart early. /2\\nPushing out McCabe is like throwing fresh meat to the wolves. It is an easy one to do, McCabe will be fine, and if it will calm the savage beast for a time, it is a no-brainer for Team Trump. Emphasis on McCabe will be fine. I saw similar dynamic w Fast &amp; Furious under Holder. /6\\nThe bottom line is that every thing we know about Trump and his advisors shows us that they are trying to manage him, his rage and reign him in. IMHO, they can assuage his rage &amp; paranoia by saying to McCabe, it’ll be easier on all if you just go early. Is any of this normal? /8\\nAs many know, I have consistently said that Chris Wray wanting a new Deputy is not unusual. At all. It is in the usual course that leadership brings in their own team, and McCabe has helped Wray transition and get his sea legs long enough. /5\\nHere are my (perhaps unconventional) thoughts on the McCabe departure today. I’m not a TV pundit but I did work @ #DOJ for 18 yrs, 15 of which I was employment counsel for DOJ. McCabe is career SES/not political. They couldn’t remove/fire him unless they all reached agreement. /1\\nIt is not unusual to reach this type of agreement with an employee you need to get out of the office. Although usually the employee would be a poor performer and usually you couldn’t pay him for not working for more than 10 days per DOJ policy. Firing McCabe would be illegal. /3',\n",

This is _the_ killer app for which everything else is built upon.\\n1/ Blockchain is a very sluggish thing. Many confirmations (= time) are needed to ensure transaction finality. It is inefficient because everybody sees all transactions. And we need to store all transactions for eternity (unless Mimblewimble is used.)\\n3/ From this hard secure foundation we can build faster &amp; cheaper payments (like the lightning network) that still carries almost the same security thanks to smart contracts.\\n4/ Despite lightning network, we probably need higher onchain capacity (if more people are using #bitcoin.) The question is how we can do this without making it too costly to run a full node. And there’s active research going on as we speak.\\n5/ One giant leap would be to be able to throw most of the data out for old transactions. That way syncing a new node from scratch would take a couple of hours regardless of how many blocks have been added.\\n7/ Things progress albeit slowly. And patience is painful.

Your typical invest advisor has no idea.\\n6/ That's extremely powerful being that there will only ever be 21M bitcoins. Today, at $15k, buying a whole #bitcoin is still in the reach of at least 1 billion people in the west who have access to credit.\\n10/ Lastly, #bitcoin is a new asset class and a new economic multiplier (it'll kickoff a new era of growth). The eventual price is much higher b/c available supply will shrink w/o affecting utility for censorship resistant pymts. In fact, new upgrades promise much more utility.\\n5/ Increases in the price of #bitcoin come from a different pool of demand than method of payment, discussed above. Price increases come from the demand to hold longer term.\\n\\nThese hodlers don't care about the day to day, or year to year volatility, they want to accumulate.\\n2/ It's important to understand that #bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. 0.00000001 btc = 1 Satoshi, the smallest unit (that the base layer will recognize).\\n4/ For those #bitcoin users, it doesn't matter what the price is. The level of payment demand can remain relatively low and constant. The variables that matter are govt prohibitions (which creates more payment demand) and stability of the network (which speaks to confidence).\\n8/ So, traditional investors that look at #bitcoin as a bubble don't understand the value proposition or the current incentive to hold.\\n\\nWe have a situation where most hodlers are accumulating and won't sell at any price, plus constant demand for censorship resistance.\\n3/ It's true, #Bitcoin isn't usable for everyday payments at the base level, no cryptocurrency is, but it is good at making transactions that are censored by credit cards and other payment methods. ie wikileaks donations, dark mrkt prescription drugs, etc.\\n7/ The other variable I mentioned, stability of the network, got a massive boost in 2017, when users fought off corporate and political attacks.

I don’t find McCabe leaving earlier than planned as so crazy today. Not panicking. /4\\nWith Fast &amp; Furious, under Holder DOJ, the White House and DOJ and Holder got hit repeatedly by the Hill Republicans, and at some point, someone had to be the fall guy. It was my friend/former colleague Jason Weinstein. Jason was a long-time career prosecutor who “resigned.” /7\\nOf course not. But to me this makes the most sense as to why McCabe is fall guy, &amp; why it happened early and caught FBI and others off guard. The good news: McCabe has much more time for Mueller now. I’m not panicked. I hope you won’t be either. /END\\nI suspect new General Counsel Dana Boente worked on a settlement agreement over weekend to get McCabe to resign in return for McCabe getting to use paid administrative leave + benefits so that he won’t take financial hit. McCabe would have agreed to stop work &amp; depart early. /2\\nPushing out McCabe is like throwing fresh meat to the wolves. It is an easy one to do, McCabe will be fine, and if it will calm the savage beast for a time, it is a no-brainer for Team Trump. Emphasis on McCabe will be fine.

IMHO, they can assuage his rage &amp; paranoia by saying to McCabe, it’ll be easier on all if you just go early. Is any of this normal? /8\\nAs many know, I have consistently said that Chris Wray wanting a new Deputy is not unusual. At all. It is in the usual course that leadership brings in their own team, and McCabe has helped Wray transition and get his sea legs long enough. /5\\nHere are my (perhaps unconventional) thoughts on the McCabe departure today. I’m not a TV pundit but I did work @ #DOJ for 18 yrs, 15 of which I was employment counsel for DOJ. McCabe is career SES/not political. They couldn’t remove/fire him unless they all reached agreement. /1\\nIt is not unusual to reach this type of agreement with an employee you need to get out of the office.

Here\\'s a roundup of articles I sent him. #womenintech #womeninSTEM (1/n)\\nThe idea you need an innate ability to do computing contributes to keeping women out of tech: https://t.co/D9Ob9eOXBw and racial minorities: https://t.co/CEgsviDyOA (9/n)\\nFirst off, one should know that CS was once female dominated in the West: https://t.co/poSOWVUL0B (2/n)\\nThe whole pipeline metaphor is problematic and should be abandoned: https://t.co/IAxBSnIiBL (6/n)\\nWomen are still getting into tech jobs but they\\'re arriving at them from \"alternate pathways\" rather than the traditional \"pipeline\", and these jobs are more likely to be lower paid and have fewer opportunities for advancement: https://t.co/VZhtp2g7q7 (5/n)\\nTLDR of all these articles: there are structural reasons for why there aren\\'t more women in tech now. It isn\\'t about the individual actions or \"choices\" of women, this is a sociological phenomenon and needs to be understood as such.\\nFeel free to add articles to the list! (10/10)\\nReturning to those \"alternate\" pathways --- pathways such as coding bootcamps could have negative effects long-term since they can increase the amount of vertical segregation in tech: https://t.co/yNiTRXDM58 (7/n)\\nOne should also know that CS is female dominated in some countries today, like Malaysia and Qatar, and that many non-Western countries have near-parity in their CS majors. https://t.co/dF5E9KAtrj (3/n)',\n",

I\\'m unclear on sequence here due to need to manage the public (civil unrest will be pushed by #Cabal).\\n2. @realDonaldTrump Next, we will need to expose, remove, and try for #Treason those involved in the #DeepState.

No one has cornered the market on #TRUTH, so be open minded.\\n6. @realDonaldTrump #Whitehats have turned the very apparatus that the #DeepState abused (#NSA) against them...we know where they are, what they are doing and saying, everything. They CANNOT hide. We\\'ve blown up their bunkers and 12/21 stripped them of access to black money.\\n4. @realDonaldTrump It\\'s still an open question on how arrests/trials will sequence. Will it be top-down (#HRC #Obama #Lynch) or a rollup...slow roll to #RedPill public ? It\\'s challenging as #POTUS faces #CognitiveDissonance, #Tribalism, and #LSM that will do what they do...#LIE.\\n10. @realDonaldTrump I saved this as my tweet...to HIGHLIGHT the MOST IMPORTANT #TRUTH of all.

This cannot wait as kids are suffering. #FranklinConspiracy, #Finders, #ConspiracyofSilence. https://t.co/49NxT1gO0N\\n7. @realDonaldTrump I believe the #Elite #TPTB should be the first to be arrested, but there may be some need to roll them up from the standpoint of evidence gathering and societal #RedPilling.

I think the root cause is that he doesn\\'t understand #Bitcoin on a sufficient technical level\\n8/ Decentralization, and that everyone can use Bitcoin completely trustless as a \"peer\" in the network is paramount, and must under no circumstances be compromised\\n7/ Increasing resource requirements for running a full node, e.g. by increasing the blocksize, jeopardizes the opportunity to be a \"peer\" in the network, while simultaneously jeopardizing decentralization\\n2/ Any politician can make grand promises of solutions to problems, and expect others to make them happen. But building and delivering is what counts\\n6/ Running a full node is the only way to send bitcoins and check that you have been payed, without having to rely on someone else. Completely trustless\\n3/ If Bitcoin is to become a foundation for human and machine peer-to-peer interaction that nobody can control or censor, each user needs to easily be able to run a full node',\n",
       " '2/ But if properly implemented blockchains are of extremely high security. And the location of sender &amp; receiver is irrelevant. This is _the_ killer app for which everything else is built upon.\\n1/ Blockchain is a very sluggish thing. Many confirmations (= time) are needed to ensure transaction finality. It is inefficient because everybody sees all transactions. And we need to store all transactions for eternity (unless Mimblewimble is used.)\\n3/ From this hard secure foundation we can build faster &amp; cheaper payments (like the lightning network) that still carries almost the same security thanks to smart contracts.\\n4/ Despite lightning network, we probably need higher onchain capacity (if more people are using #bitcoin.) The question is how we can do this without making it too costly to run a full node. And there’s active research going on as we speak.\\n5/ One giant leap would be to be able to throw most of the data out for old transactions. That way syncing a new node from scratch would take a couple of hours regardless of how many blocks have been added.\\n7/ Things progress albeit slowly. And patience is painful. But what we do know, and this is the cool part, is that whatever banks do, they cannot do it better. Blockchain is really useless, unless you build an immutable, decentralized, permissionless &amp; borderless network.#bitcoin\\n6/ That tech is known as Mimblewimble and there are multiple ways of implementing it.

The decimal is arbitrary.\\n\\nThese wild swings in supply vs demand only happen today in bitcoin. Your typical invest advisor has no idea.\\n6/ That's extremely powerful being that there will only ever be 21M bitcoins. Today, at $15k, buying a whole #bitcoin is still in the reach of at least 1 billion people in the west who have access to credit.\\n10/ Lastly, #bitcoin is a new asset class and a new economic multiplier (it'll kickoff a new era of growth). The eventual price is much higher b/c available supply will shrink w/o affecting utility for censorship resistant pymts. In fact, new upgrades promise much more utility.\\n5/ Increases in the price of #bitcoin come from a different pool of demand than method of payment, discussed above. Price increases come from the demand to hold longer term.\\n\\nThese hodlers don't care about the day to day, or year to year volatility, they want to accumulate.\\n2/ It's important to understand that #bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. 0.00000001 btc = 1 Satoshi, the smallest unit (that the base layer will recognize).\\n4/ For those #bitcoin users, it doesn't matter what the price is. The level of payment demand can remain relatively low and constant. The variables that matter are govt prohibitions (which creates more payment demand) and stability of the network (which speaks to confidence).\\n8/ So, traditional investors that look at #bitcoin as a bubble don't understand the value proposition or the current incentive to hold.\\n\\nWe have a situation where most hodlers are accumulating and won't sell at any price, plus constant demand for censorship resistance.\\n3/ It's true, #Bitcoin isn't usable for everyday payments at the base level, no cryptocurrency is, but it is good at making transactions that are censored by credit cards and other payment methods. ie wikileaks donations, dark mrkt prescription drugs, etc.\\n7/ The other variable I mentioned, stability of the network, got a massive boost in 2017, when users fought off corporate and political attacks.
