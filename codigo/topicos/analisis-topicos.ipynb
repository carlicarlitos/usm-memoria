I don’t find McCabe leaving earlier than planned as so crazy today. Not panicking. /4\\nWith Fast &amp; Furious, under Holder DOJ, the White House and DOJ and Holder got hit repeatedly by the Hill Republicans, and at some point, someone had to be the fall guy. It was my friend/former colleague Jason Weinstein. Jason was a long-time career prosecutor who “resigned.” /7\\nOf course not. But to me this makes the most sense as to why McCabe is fall guy, &amp; why it happened early and caught FBI and others off guard. The good news: McCabe has much more time for Mueller now. I’m not panicked. I hope you won’t be either. /END\\nI suspect new General Counsel Dana Boente worked on a settlement agreement over weekend to get McCabe to resign in return for McCabe getting to use paid administrative leave + benefits so that he won’t take financial hit. McCabe would have agreed to stop work &amp; depart early. /2\\nPushing out McCabe is like throwing fresh meat to the wolves. It is an easy one to do, McCabe will be fine, and if it will calm the savage beast for a time, it is a no-brainer for Team Trump. Emphasis on McCabe will be fine.

IMHO, they can assuage his rage &amp; paranoia by saying to McCabe, it’ll be easier on all if you just go early. Is any of this normal? /8\\nAs many know, I have consistently said that Chris Wray wanting a new Deputy is not unusual. At all. It is in the usual course that leadership brings in their own team, and McCabe has helped Wray transition and get his sea legs long enough. /5\\nHere are my (perhaps unconventional) thoughts on the McCabe departure today. I’m not a TV pundit but I did work @ #DOJ for 18 yrs, 15 of which I was employment counsel for DOJ. McCabe is career SES/not political. They couldn’t remove/fire him unless they all reached agreement. /1\\nIt is not unusual to reach this type of agreement with an employee you need to get out of the office.

Vote out elected officials with close ties to nativist, white nationalist, or fearmongering groups such as FAIR, CIS, NumbersUSA, US Inc., KKK, VDare, etc.\\n25.

Deep State has been placing these people for decades. They now control enough of the Government to make their move.\\n6) Back to Red October - One of the final threats to Ramius handing the Russian Sub over to the Americans is that there's a 'cook' who's actually a KGB agent who tries to set off one of the Nuclear Missiles in the Sub to destroy the Sub. He is killed seconds before he succeeds.\\n1) We Patriots must expand our thinking. If you haven't watched Red October, you should. It depicts exactly what's going on right now. @POTUS is Captain Ramius &amp; is delivering #DeepState to Justice because they tried to destroy the US Constitution.\\n4) @POTUS and the @USMC are using Military Intelligence to locate these #DeepState 'sleepers' that are in our Government, Private Industry and Foreign Governments and removing them from their roles. In essence, they're 'de-constructing' the Deep State Infrastructure.\\n5) The reason you don't see any arrests or media coverage is because it is indeed a 'Civil War' going on behind the scenes for control of the levers of power for the Federal Government. There are many 'actors' posing as loyal Americans who are in fact getting paid to subvert us.\\n8) What can we do? PRAY! Pray for POTUS. Pray for America. Pray for our Military &amp; our Marines. Pray that they can remove #DeepState without loss of American Life. Make no mistake. We are at War inside our borders that we must win or we'll lose our Nation.\\n7) That is exactly what Trump &amp; the Marines are facing. They have to take out the #DeepState actors that have influence &amp; can harm Americans before they can begin the mass arrests. Look at the #FloridaShooting - That was a message to POTUS that Deep State still has influence.\\n9) What else can we do? Vote! Vote like your Life and Nation depends on it. Because it does.

I don’t find McCabe leaving earlier than planned as so crazy today. Not panicking. /4\\nWith Fast &amp; Furious, under Holder DOJ, the White House and DOJ and Holder got hit repeatedly by the Hill Republicans, and at some point, someone had to be the fall guy. It was my friend/former colleague Jason Weinstein. Jason was a long-time career prosecutor who “resigned.” /7\\nOf course not. But to me this makes the most sense as to why McCabe is fall guy, &amp; why it happened early and caught FBI and others off guard. The good news: McCabe has much more time for Mueller now. I’m not panicked. I hope you won’t be either. /END\\nI suspect new General Counsel Dana Boente worked on a settlement agreement over weekend to get McCabe to resign in return for McCabe getting to use paid administrative leave + benefits so that he won’t take financial hit. McCabe would have agreed to stop work &amp; depart early. /2\\nPushing out McCabe is like throwing fresh meat to the wolves. It is an easy one to do, McCabe will be fine, and if it will calm the savage beast for a time, it is a no-brainer for Team Trump. Emphasis on McCabe will be fine. I saw similar dynamic w Fast &amp; Furious under Holder. /6\\nThe bottom line is that every thing we know about Trump and his advisors shows us that they are trying to manage him, his rage and reign him in. IMHO, they can assuage his rage &amp; paranoia by saying to McCabe, it’ll be easier on all if you just go early. Is any of this normal? /8\\nAs many know, I have consistently said that Chris Wray wanting a new Deputy is not unusual. At all. It is in the usual course that leadership brings in their own team, and McCabe has helped Wray transition and get his sea legs long enough. /5\\nHere are my (perhaps unconventional) thoughts on the McCabe departure today. I’m not a TV pundit but I did work @ #DOJ for 18 yrs, 15 of which I was employment counsel for DOJ. McCabe is career SES/not political. They couldn’t remove/fire him unless they all reached agreement. /1\\nIt is not unusual to reach this type of agreement with an employee you need to get out of the office. Although usually the employee would be a poor performer and usually you couldn’t pay him for not working for more than 10 days per DOJ policy. Firing McCabe would be illegal. /3',\n",

All too often, we\\'re bypassed by Anglo publicists and predominantly white institutions in favor of more \"mainstream\" outlets.\\nThis year, @Remezcla was credentialed to cover the #Oscars for the 1st time. It felt meaningful to have a presence there in a year that saw so much LatAm talent celebrated. It felt even more meaningful that our DACAmented correspondent @Carlos_Film could rep for DREAMers tonight.\\nThese struggles aren\\'t exclusive to Latino media. Across the board, minority journos routinely see themselves shut out from accessing minority talent, even though they\\'re the ones best equipped to understand and contextualize the work.\\nNever mind that mainstream America wouldn\\'t be having conversations about diversity &amp; inclusion if it weren\\'t for the hard-fought, dedicated work of so-called \"niche\" minority publishers, writers and advocates.\\nBut I\\'d like to point out that Remezcla wouldn\\'t have been at the Oscars at all if a Latina Academy voter hadn\\'t fought on our behalf. After our credential application was initially rejected, she advocated for our inclusion as an outlet and got us in the door.\\nan addendum to say that everyone should read @mendezberry eloquent &amp; compelling look into the issues critics of color are facing today. She also gives a nod to @infoCinelandia\\'s imp work centering the voices of Latino critics on \\'Coco\\' &lt;3\\n\\nhttps://t.co/va0RVYFUFY\\nThe gag is, established Latinx talent WANTS to talk to us. I can\\'t tell you the number of times artists have stepped in to override publicists/labels/reps after our interview requests were ignored/declined. But that\\'s if &amp; when we have a direct line to them. Many times, we don\\'t.\\nRemezcla has spent over 10 years uplifting &amp; advocating for Latinx creators, and we deserve a seat at the table.

This is _the_ killer app for which everything else is built upon.\\n1/ Blockchain is a very sluggish thing. Many confirmations (= time) are needed to ensure transaction finality. It is inefficient because everybody sees all transactions. And we need to store all transactions for eternity (unless Mimblewimble is used.)\\n3/ From this hard secure foundation we can build faster &amp; cheaper payments (like the lightning network) that still carries almost the same security thanks to smart contracts.\\n4/ Despite lightning network, we probably need higher onchain capacity (if more people are using #bitcoin.) The question is how we can do this without making it too costly to run a full node. And there’s active research going on as we speak.\\n5/ One giant leap would be to be able to throw most of the data out for old transactions. That way syncing a new node from scratch would take a couple of hours regardless of how many blocks have been added.\\n7/ Things progress albeit slowly. And patience is painful. But what we do know, and this is the cool part, is that whatever banks do, they cannot do it better. Blockchain is really useless, unless you build an immutable, decentralized, permissionless &amp; borderless network.#bitcoin\\n6/ That tech is known as Mimblewimble and there are multiple ways of implementing it. We don’t which one is most suitable for #bitcoin just yet. Another cool tech that would help is Schnorr signatures. That would drastically make the transactions smaller. And more private!',\n",

       " 'With the above case for the electron, we can find something called the transmission coefficient, which is literally the probability of a particle to pass through a barrier. It looks like this: (Sakurai P. 526) https://t.co/atQvwXJbZt\\n#SaturdayNightThoughts\\nSo, using the tiny mass of an electron and a really tiny barrier, we get substantial probabilities that the electron will tunnel through the barrier. Things that decrease the probabilities significantly: using more massive particles, and thicker barriers.\\nLet\\'s see how this works for a human. In this case we\\'ll use the equation that has the k and κ in it, where these are just wavenumbers, which measure properties of a wave. We\\'ll focus on the sinh part of equation, where κ = p/h_bar, where p is the momentum = mass times velocity.\\nNote: when I say the probability of a human tunneling through a wall is e^-10^35, I mean the exponential raised to -10^35, as in, the negative 1 followed by 35 zeros, as in e^-100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. So, \"vanishingly small\" is an understatement!\\nLet\\'s have a person with a mass of, say, 70 kg, run towards a wall that\\'s about 10 cm, or 0.1 m thick, with a speed of 4 m/s. Now, let\\'s look again at that sinh part, and note that sinh^2(κa) is approximately e^2κa, so we\\'ll just use the exponential.\\nThis quantum tunneling thread was such a hit that I went ahead and drew a cute cartoon thingy of a tennis ball and an electron trying to tunnel for you all, and I can\\'t even draw https://t.co/RjJ7mAPkH6\\nWhat those things stand for:\\nV: energy of potential barrier\\nE: energy of particle\\na: width of barrier\\nm: mass of particle\\nћ (or h_bar): Planck constant divided by 2π (just a constant we need in quantum).\\nSinh is the hyperbolic sine function that absorbs the imaginary part of sin\\nSo, while there\\'s *kinda* is a nonzero probability of a human tunnelling through a wall, it\\'s so vanishingly small that we can safely say it\\'s not gonna happen. So, let\\'s save our human friend that unnecessary thump with that wall and let particles do the tunnelling 😉\\nPlugging in the numbers gives e^5.3*10^35 which is about e^10^35. That number is so incomprehensible big that the remaining factors of the equation are insignificant! But what we got is in the denominator, so the probability of a human of tunnelling is e^-10^35.\\nThe set up: a barrier with a higher energy than an electron. Think a tall wall, and a ball that didn\\'t get thrown high enough to go over. Classically, the electron scatters back, like the ball bounces back. But in quantum, that electron has a probability of passing through!\\nThought you all might like to know, say, the probability of a human passing through a wall. Yes? Yes, because #QuantumMechanics is fun! Let\\'s begin!',\n",

King and SNCC’s non-violent protest made it increasingly clear that racial segregation and exploitation were monstrous. 3/13\\nThese attacks narrowed the definition from “the historically rooted pattern of social stratification and exploitation rooted in race” to “mean people.” They have belittled the consequences of racial violence and focused cultural attentions on small slights to one’s identity. 8/13\\nImportantly, the solution is not to stop calling things racist (lest the word lose its meaning). The solution is to insist on the right definition. And to pair the murderous rhetoric these ideologues use with their historic consequences. 12/13\\nThat said, what Bannon is doing here, and neo-Nazi’s all over have been doing globally, is different still. They are extending the popular tropes that suggest claims of racism are really rooted in “excess sensitivity” and “weakness.” 9/13\\nBecause this didn’t happen overnight—and because folks don’t read history books—some folks forget that “racist” wasn’t always a dirty word. Consequently, many don’t really give weight to considering what would happen if that protection went away. 5/13\\nAnd that extension says, “See. To be called a racist ONLY means that you are angering the sensitive and the weak. That’s all racism really is!” 10/13\\nThis stuff is not just politics. It’s not a joke. This stuff kills whole groups and generations of people. Just because it’s not happening yet, doesn’t mean it’s not the same as before. /fin\\nRacial progress in this country and others takes a winding path.

It was a choreographed effort by House Republicans and top White House officials to push a highly contentious theme...\"\\nAnd it works. Stunning, sad poll for @Axios by @surveymonkey: Donald Trump had turned the GOP against the FBI: https://t.co/ZjwGS4AZdL\\nNow, read this, from @DissentMag on the \"new conspiracists\", by @RussellMuirhead and Nancy Rosenblum. \"The conspiracist mindset moved into the White House with the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.\" https://t.co/XjjMF1eNvJ\\nThe #ReleaseTheMemo campaign, neatly summarized by @MollyMcKew: https://t.co/idRjeqrWlz\\n\"Conspiracism is not new of course, but the conspiracism we see today does introduce something new—conspiracy without the theory.

       " 'It is only after the child is a bit grown &amp; starts becoming aware of the truth of the Family that they will be taught these things are intentional. Some will never realize it if they don\\'t join the cult as adult members. Mind Control trainees will be taught this directly. (7)\\nPeople often wonder how cult members who may be unaffiliated with each other can spot each other, or how unrelated cult members can pick out cult raised unaware victims like me. There are MANY answers to this question, but right now, I want to focus on LANGUAGE. (2)\\nThis is but a SLIVER of the tactics &amp; tools the cult uses to keep the system going in secret. These practices exist to ensure the continuation of the system only-100% self serving &amp; EVIL. The mental prison Family members are left in is based in STRONG family systems psychology 14\\nIf we consider hand signals &amp; body language under this same umbrella, then consider that the \"kids\" (as we are called) are taught to do the OK, thumbs up, Devil Horns etc, VERY early on - like before age 5. We then go flash these hand signs in our daily lives - 100% oblivious (6)\\nSo that\\'s when they begin to learn, consciously, about the meaning of the code words and hand signals they\\'ve been using their whole lives, plus some knew ones that have secret meaning intended only for active adult cult members - Masonic handshakes and signals, etc. (9)\\nThere are words that are relatively common but idiosyncratic in the American lexicon. The cult has specific words they use, and teach their children to use from birth. The child doesn\\'t even know they are speaking codes. Some examples: Kiddo, Ditto, Fair Enough, etc. (3)\\nSo when a cult child\\'s vocabulary is being built, they are embedding it with cult codes, so when the child grows up and starts speaking to others, those who know what to look out for will pick up on the use of these words and identify the speaker as a cult member, aware or not(4)\\nI want to talk about one aspect of this cult that may help to highlight just how powerfully insidious their methods are. This may give some of you the perspective you are lacking in order to grasp just how evil &amp; enormous this beast is (1) #TheGreatAwakening #HivitesGetLit #MAGA\\nThe ONLY way this is possible is by starting at birth, and \"keeping it in the family\" through this incredibly complex method of inter-generational abuse and trauma based mind control that stems from f*ing Babylon FFS. (12)\\nThis is the method of clandestine \"passing on of the tradition\" that allows these things to go totally unnoticed out in the open. You would really have to be one of them to know WTF these things mean &amp; to be able to ascertain from it a person\\'s personality &amp; role in the cult (10)\\nEvery cult born child is offered an opportunity to join (either at 13 during the coming of age ritual, or later when they return to the cult based on programming or attraction to the occult). Those who join are funneled into the Freemason societies or local pylon for training (8)\\nLet that sink in. 6000+ years parents have been doing this to their kids in these families. Every generation, since Babylon, has had a population of people doing this to their \"kids\" - generation after generation until we reach the present moment &amp; our current predicament. (13)\\nIt\\'s also extremely important to understand that, though these words &amp; signals may have been modified over the years as these people have grown &amp; spread over the glove, the basic rituals, \"spell\" words, &amp; structure of the system have been replicated, in tact, for MILLENNIA (11)\\nThis is just one very tiny part of the mind control and code language feature of this system. But it illustrates how EVERY aspect of the child\\'s development is centered around the cult, cult practices, and cult patters. For EVERYONE born into it. All of us. (5)',\n",

Originally, these coins contained 90% silver but in 1965 the silver content was reduced to 40%.\\n5/ As a result, the older 90% silver coins quickly disappeared from circulation as people hoarded them for their fundamental value, while they transacted with the newer debased coins since they legally had the same face value.\\n3/ People will hoard the “good” money (which becomes the store of value) and transact with the “bad” money (which becomes the medium of exchange). Merchants are forced to accept this “bad” money because of the legal tender laws.\\n8/ Now, a merchant has the right to refuse a payment if they deem it “bad” money. In time, debt will be paid with “good” money, as demanded by the merchant or recipient of the transaction.\\n11/ This is Thiers\\' Law (the reverse of Gresham\\'s Law) which argues that \"bad\" money (in our case, fiat) will drive “good” money (Bitcoin or insert your favorite crypto coin here) to a premium rather than driving it out of circulation.\\n7/ Cryptocurrencies are changing all of this. #Bitcoin is exchanged across borders worldwide and has the potential to act as a global reserve currency.

For those urging appeasement so Russia doesn\\'t escalate, the fact is that Russia has been escalating anyway. Almost all Western liberal democracies have faced Russian interference.

       " '1. You’ve probably seen articles like this today and, hopefully, you’re reading them — and not just for the joy of watching the #GOP squirm at a squeaking defeat in what should’ve been a GOP blowout. The reactions of the opposition are strategic clues. https://t.co/BRhCgyM1gH\\n12. The reality is that we’re all right. The difficulty is figuring out and applying a successful strategy. Like our party, there is no one-size fits all candidate. Long time grassroots activist knew this when we came together to form @DemsWork4USA.\\n6. Clearly they don’t. Because the numbers don’t tell that story. They know what’s worked in the past. They’ve mastered the fear of ‘progress’ and diversity. They’ve demonized ‘overreach of the government’. They all too happily allowed DT’s campaign of blame, fear and hate.\\n3. Let’s unpack that a little. Two things are implied here. One, they know that GOP (and their support of DT) is frowned on enough that there is willingness to vote Dem in red districts with palatable messaging (moderate, willingness to work in a bipartisan manner).\\n10. Democrats are never going to be a one-size fits all party. It’s not who we are. We are a ‘big tent’ and will have differing views as a matter of course. But, our legislative process hinges on a majority AND bipartisanship. Without it, no policy sees the light of day.\\n13. District by district. Candidate by candidate. We recognized we had to rigorously assess each constituency and find the candidate that had the best chance of winning there. Those candidates look very different from each other - because they must.\\n14. There are indeed places where a more progressive candidate will fare very well. And there are places like #PA18. If Ryan is right, we would‘ve trapped ourselves into defeat in the primary process. Don’t disregard the strategy of the opposition when it’s given. Take heed.\\n2. Particularly, I want to draw your attention to this statement from Paul Ryan. Basically, he’s pointing out that because Lamb didn’t have a primary opponent, he was able to run as a more conservative Dem which allowed him to win a district DT won by 20 pts. https://t.co/ONsblUq614\\n7. They’re willing to ride the wave of backlash against progress. After all, they’ve been doing so for a long time and as the world has gotten smaller, strife and hardship has grown, and their method has gained power. Throw in propaganda and anti-intellectualism - even better.\\n8. They know some other things, too. They know GOP dwarf us in vote-turnout. They usually completely outfund and outspend us. And they know our weakness is self-righteousness. The intellectual and moral high-ground that so many have no use for.\\n4. They are counting on the fact that even with their poor approval and DT’s toxicity, constituents will still vote for them over a further left candidate. They’re reading the room on the division on the Left. They’re relying on primaries to drive candidates left.\\n9. So, are they right? Is #PA18 an outlier because Lamb was a ‘unicorn’? Is the electorate truly just that conservative? Or is there this great untapped source of voters yearning for a more progressive candidate? There is an answer here, it’s just not simple.\\n11. The red-state Dems that people call DINOS are Democrats who vote with the party 80% of the time. They are elected as a harbinger that their constituents are willing to take a risk - to loosen the reigns. This isn’t something to take lightly or put in jeopardy.\\n5. Why do they feel confident in this? The idea has been thrust over the past 18 months that Dems can only win by running more progressive candidates to spurn enthusiasm. That voters will come out and vote if we do this. That this is the path to victory. Don’t they see that?',\n",

Find someone who will lift you up when you\\'re down &amp; take you down a notch when you\\'re over confident. Ideally, they\\'ve been a CEO/founder before so they can empathize. Remember though: they offer guidance, not a script.\\n13/ Control your mood meeting-to-meeting. Sometimes you will have a bad/devastating meeting but try to remember that the next set of people don’t have that context &amp; may be excited/stressed to meet with you.\\n15/ Finally, keep working hard to improve. You can’t fix mistakes of the past but you can be better in the future. Don\\'t give up: when you make hard decisions, you get to know which values/principles you truly stand for. That alone makes the journey worth it. ✊\\n8/ Don\\'t avoid confrontation with tough, critical decisions--deal with it head-on. Avoiding confrontation, builds resentment over time, it slows the company down, &amp; relationships eventually turn sour in a irrevocable way creating instability. Attack problems, not people though.\\n11/ Your intuition about customers/the market will get worse as the organization grows &amp; you become further estranged from customers.

Now\\'s the time to design it to be fun &amp; productive.\\n6/ Live by the mantra: “you should be building a team that can fulfill the mission without you.” You will be less stressed in the long-run. Keep empowering others. When you forget, try &amp; ask yourself why you started this thing in the first place. Was it really about $$/power/ego?\\n7/ Power = responsibility. Being CEO will become lonely as you can\\'t be as vulnerable &amp; authentic as you\\'d like. Find other founders who will be real with you. Have dinners with them &amp; share problems openly. I\\'ve been given hugs by them during tough times. It made the difference.\\n12/ Discovering the truth becomes hard as you grow. It also becomes the most important thing you can do as you guide the company. Make acquiring it &amp; using it for decision a part of the culture somehow. I did this by constantly asking people what the actual facts were.\\n3/ Your VCs won\\'t want to offend you so I\\'ll suggest it: get a CEO coach &amp; do a 360 review of yourself every few years. It was life changing for me. You can’t fix everything about yourself. Focus on 2-3 things each year. Tell your company you’re doing it. It\\'ll build trust.\\n2/ Giving up control is hard &amp; it was the hardest for me. I felt like everything at the beginning was important. You can\\'t be good at everything tho.

       " '11/ This has a two-fold downside: their team execution suffers without sufficient PM attention, and it stifles the potential creativity from non-product teammates.\\n6/ That does not, however, mean they should make even a small fraction of decisions themselves. They should be the ultimate facilitator: pull the best ideas from their team, coordinate with xfn partners, get exec context, etc.\\n15/ This requires developing deep domain knowledge, communicating compelling, and setting an inspirational strategy.\\n18/ PMs do need to have a deep curiosity about the underlying tech, humility about the details, ability to develop strong partnerships with engineering, and a voracious learning appetite.\\n5/ PMs are responsible for the pace and quality of decision making. Full stop.\\n2/ “PMs are mini CEOs”: This is admittedly a catchy tagline. CEOs have direct management responsibilities, decision making authority, business-level objective ownership, and often founder-level credibility for the original vision.\\n12/ PMs do need to immerse themselves in context and research to prime coming up with great product ideas. In an ideal world, that’s a constant team exercise the PM just happens to drive.\\n19/ In summary, just a few dangerous PM myths to avoid: mini CEO, chief decision maker, primary idea generator, political savant, and tech degree required.\\n1/ Product Management isn’t a major one can study, few folks graduate into, and most people learn by apprenticeship. There are number of dangerous myths about what the PM role is. Here is a thread with five…\\n13/ “PMs have to be great at company politics”: Unfortunately, at the largest companies this one is a bit true. But at companies in the thousands or smaller, that degree of politics only happens when shared alignment breaks down.\\n16/ “PMs need technical degrees”: I believe this started with Google’s hiring of CS students directly into product, as a backlash of the MBA influx during the dot-com bubble. Though I was one of them, I disagree with the premise.\\n7/ They should lay out well-researched tradeoffs, time-box deliberation, and structure great discussions.\\n14/ Great PMs are an antidote to startup politics emerging. They keep disparate groups bought into a shared vision of where the company/product needs to head.\\n9/ “PMs are the idea generators”: More than any other product dev role, PMs are judged nearly exclusively on the output of their team. Unlike eng or design, there are few independent artifacts to hang their hats on.\\n17/ While a technical foundation is certainly useful for PMs, like every hiring heuristic applied unconditionally as a filter it produces far too many false negatives.\\n3/ In reality, PMs have none of these. It’s a pernicious trap, because the PMs who act as if they are mini CEO for a feature are the most likely candidates for a team organ rejection. Teammates want product leaders, not dictators.\\n8/ Only in rare situations should they actually “make the call”. When they do, it withdraws from their organizational capital account balance. That needs constant deposits as a counterbalance.\\n10/ The degenerate case is PMs who think their ultimate work product is new ideas. They churn out 10x more concepts than their team could ever build.\\n4/ “PMs are the decision makers”: Many people who convert from another role into product see it as way to get to “make the calls”. It’s a common pattern, especially for disempowered engineers on dysfunctional product development teams.',\n",

       " \"13/During the debate at #deconomy2018 with @Excellion, @rogerkver infamously declared that more babies and people are dying because people chose #Bitcoin over $BCH. This is a logical fallacy, an appeal to emotion. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/JYBen3ayIO\\n10/@rogerkver says 'people' wrestled control of #Bitcoin away from others. False. This shows a complete misunderstanding of the tech. If you believe cryptocurrencies can be controlled and taken over, then you should not value them. Lack of centralized control is the main feature\\nLast/ At #SeoulBitcoin, we want to help people rely on their own understanding of #Bitcoin to see through these false, misleading, or cherry picked claims made by any and all poorly informed and self-aggrandizing critics. And we agree with @jcp on polite discussion.\\n15/@rogerkver claims that #Bitcoin is slow and expensive while $BCH is fast and cheap. False. Bitcoin is not BOTH slow and expensive. It is sometimes one or the other. Also, see /5 for reasons why $BCH has cheaper transactions than Bitcoin.\\n4/@rogerkver can say that he didn't change to $BCH and he can say that $BCH is #Bitcoin, but if nobody else sees it that way - it's just bad communication.\\nThread: 1/@rogerkver has been speaking around #Korea, such as at #deconomy2018 (along with @Excellion, @Jcp, @VitalikButerin, + many others). We want to address some of his popular talking points, such as the ones in his promotion video: https://t.co/CJG2T0UT4h\\n5/@rogerkver claims $BCH is cheaper to send (has lower fees) than #Bitcoin $BTC. This is true for any coins that either sacrifice decentralization (the only distinguishing feature of cryptocurrency) or for coins that see low usage (such as $BCH or the early days of Bitcoin.\\n7/@rogerkver claimed $BCH is not double-spendable. False. Unconfirmed transactions have no consensus by definition. Trusting that a transaction gets into a block before it gets confirmed points to miner centralization. Competitive miners mine a double-spend if the fee is higher\\n6/@rogerkver often claims that $BCH is 'basically instant' while #Bitcoin 'can take several days'. If you pay the required fee, $BTC will get confirmed in the next block. What's true is that Bitcoin fees are higher. Caveat: see tweet #5 of this thread\\n12/@rogerkver criticizes 'replace-by-fee' in #Bitcoin. This is an excellent technology that matches the profit-seeking behavior of miners\\n\\nHe believes people in Korea buy $BCH because it's 'like cash'. The reality is that people in Korea barely take their $crypto off the exchange\\n3/@rogerkver and many others overestimated #Bitcoin technology in the early days, pitching it in certain way, based on what they saw at that time. Merchant adoption would be nice to see, but is limited by the constraints of the technology. That became clear as adoption grew.\\n9/@rogerkver claims $BCH is actually more private than #Bitcoin. Unsubstantiated claim. We're waiting to hear his reasons for saying so.\\n11/@rogerkver thinks #Bitcoin is 'controlled' by 'people' who openly say they want blocks to be full. False. Bitcoin supporters want it to be infinite in size and free, but the constraints of reality compel us to do otherwise.\\n2/starting with a promotion of https://t.co/OWbdOGTZj5 - several pointers: this website presents itself as a Bitcoin site and as a community. In fact, it's a for-profit site to promote $BCH first and foremost. There ARE strings attached. He HAS a stake in it, incentive to promote\\n8/@rogerkver claimed $BCH is more reliable than #Bitcoin because your transaction will get into the next block. False. BCH is not more reliable than Bitcoin. See answers 6/ and 7/ of this thread.\\n14/@rogerkver claims that zero confirmation transactions are safe on $BCH. This is false. Zero confirmation transactions are unsafe because they're susceptible to double-spend attacks, or $BCH has centralized mining which means the entire BCH blockchain isn't safe.\",\n",

(Yes that includes Russia &amp; China). #Facebook #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered /17\\nFormer CIA agent contacts and classified knowledge is being put on the open market internationally. This is from a company that runs a completely parallel intelligence and military to the US government and is headed by a man who said “Blackwater is a private company. /16\\nOne, everyone is completely insane, or two, it has not been a sovereign nation for a long time.

By yet another name, they are Total Intelligence Solutions, which is a private intelligence contractor headed by the former head of CIA counterterrorism who ran the extraordinary rendition program for Bush./14\\nThe Intelligence Mafia. by Heather Marsh, written almost a decade ago, still very true. #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered https://t.co/Ann52dvD5w …\\nObama used the terms “american intelligence” and “american military” to play games with the truth (see “american troops pull out of Iraq”). If they are private contractors, they aren’t american intelligence, right? /6\\nAccording to their research, there are 1200 government agencies, more than 3,666 private companies, 17,000 locations, and 854,000 people in the US that have Top Secret security clearance. Top Secret. None of the cables released by Wikileaks this week are Top Secret. /3\\nCan you even imagine the amount of data here? This is what the US calls “information dominance” and a “global surveillance system”.  Almost all IT and communication companies in the US are a part of the network, and they reach across the globe. /4\\nThere are only two possible explanations for a sovereign nation to bankrupt its own citizens &amp; its government in order to set up a huge international surveillance &amp; military system, “the finest fighting force the world has ever seen” that they do not actually own or control.  /18\\nThis private company, staffed by ex members of all branches of US government intelligence, has been aggressively marketing to Fortune 1000 companies. They state that they can bring CIA type services to the corporate boardroom. #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered /15\\n“Not only were private contractors involved in the extreme interrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, they have taken over the training of military interrogators at the U.S. Army’s Intelligence Center in Fort Huachuca, Arizona.\" /11\\nThey also have a classified bid system that makes corruption between private companies &amp; politicians particularly easy. Again, like military contractors, they are not being used in secondary roles, they are used in training &amp; in developing &amp; operating all high tech industries. /9\\nWhat is the difference between a terrorist and a soldier? The actions are now identical, both act to produce terror, so probably the only standing difference is that terrorists are non-government agencies. Remember that. /1\\nIn 2007, 70% of all intelligence budgets were spent on private contractors. That was (11) years ago, and we don’t know how that has changed because all intelligence budgets are classified, but the trend since then has been a definite shift towards more private contractors. /5\\nThey are paid with huge amounts of tax money, and in turn, are in a position to drastically influence governmental policies. #Facebook \\n#CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered /10\\nAnd there are other much more important reasons for private contractors, they are allowed to make huge donations to political parties from their billion tax dollar contracts. (See Eric Prince / Black Water donations to #Trump) /7\\nThe US intelligence infrastructure is not just huge, it is colossal, a parallel society living among us (yes, us, wherever you live). That has been amply illustrated by the investigative journalism project Top Secret America.  /2\\nLike military contractors, private companies also are not bound by government procedure, their contracts are classified so most of the government has no idea what they are doing, and they are private companies who do not have to disclose information to the public. #Facebook /8\\n\"And in hotspots around the world, private contractors are taking the place of government operatives.

       " '7) Version officielle de #Prince lors de son audition par le comité du renseignement de la Chambre: rencontre fortuite avec Dmitriev, via des clients émiratis.Version découverte par #Mueller: mise au point d\\'1 canal secret de com\\' entre #Trump et #Poutine. https://t.co/cMwjLPcEEe\\n2) #Breaking #Trump commence bien sûr sa journée en répondant au scoop du @nytimes d\\'hier qui lui pose 1 énorme problème (car il compromet encore un peu plus son fils). SON argument: comme #Mueller n\\'a rien trouvé sur la #Russie, il cherche n\\'importe quoi. https://t.co/NYiEOBh2k5\\n13) Ce qui est terrible pour #Trump Jr (et donc son père) est que le #breaking d\\'hier du @nytimes établit d\\'1 part 1 campagne ouverte à toute aide étrangère pour s\\'en sortir et d\\'autre part rend la défense\"Oui mais c\\'était qu\\'1 fois par hasard avec la #Russie\" intenable...\\n10) Quand #Trump Jr a son entrevue du 9 juin 2016 avec l\\'avocate russe Veselnitskaya, dont il est établi qu\\'elle est 1 informatrice habituelle du procureur général de Russie Chaika, il y est attiré par la promesse d\\'infos compromettantes sur #Clinton fournie par la #Russie...\\n12) #Trump Jr défendit lors de son audition au Sénat que la réunion avec Veselnitskaya fut décevante, qu\\'elle n\\'avait finalement aucune info intéressante et qu\\'il n\\'y avait eu aucune suite. Soit. Mais 2 mois plus tard il accepte donc 1 nouvelle entrevue pour de l\\'aide étrangère.\\n16) L\\'émissaire des Emirats et de l\\'Arabie Saoudite lors de cette rencontre d\\'août 2016 Nader a en effet été retourné par #Mueller il y a environ 3 mois et le procureur spécial sait donc tout de ce qui s\\'est dit ou pas lors de la réunion d\\'août avec #Trump Jr....\\n17) Et devinez quoi? Ce #Nader, conseiller d\\'influence des princes émirati et saoudien MBZ et MBS a pour partenaire d\\'affaire régulier...#Dmitriev le proche de #Poutine rencontré par #Prince aux Seychelles...https://t.co/sCNHCIHgBz\\n11) #Trump Jr, après avoir caché cette entrevue du 9 juin 2016 puis affirmé qu\\'elle était sur l\\'adoption, a été trahi par ses courriels où on l\\'informait de la volonté de la #Russie d\\'aider la campagne de son père. MAIS défense: il n\\'y avait finalement pas eu d\\'infos utiles...\\n6) Or, pourquoi Erik Prince était-il déjà sur les\"écrans\"des enquêtes sur la collusion avec la #Russie? Parce qu\\'en janvier 2017, 1 fois #Trump élu, il rencontre aux Seychelles Dmitriev, 1 hedge funder très proche de #Poutine...à l\\'initiative du prince des Emirats MBZ...#hasard\\n15) 3e point décisif du #breaking du @nytimes d\\'hier, expliquant à mon avis la fureur incontrôlée de #Trump ce matin. Pour l\\'entrevue de juin 2016 avec les Russes, pour l\\'instant, Trump Jr, Kushner et Manafort sont sur la même ligne. Pour celle d\\'août, Nader coopère avec #Mueller\\n18) Bref, contrairement à ce que dit #Trump, le #breaking du @nytimes qui s\\'appuie de toute évidence sur les confessions de #Nader à #Mueller, a TOUT à voir avec l\\'éventuelle collusion russe, qui serait directement superposée à celle avec l\\'Arabie Saoudite et les Emirats...\\n#Breaking BADABOUM thermonucléaire. Au printemps 2016, #Trump Jr a reçu des propositions d\\'aide pour la campagne de son père des Émirats, d\\'Arabie saoudite et d\\'1 compagnie israélienne spécialiste de la manipulation des réseaux sociaux. Il a dit oui.#Mueller le sait. Game changer https://t.co/hazLN4TCoH\\n5) Car- 1er point- la rencontre d\\'août 2016 entre #Trump Jr, Nader émissaire de l\\'Arabie saoudite et des EAU et du patron de la firme israélienne est mise sur pied par Erik Prince, fondateur de la firme de sécurité privée Blackwater (et par ailleurs frère de la ministre DeVos)...\\n9) 2e point du #breaking majeur du @nytimes qui contredit la logorrhée actuelle de tweets de #Trump (il en est à 7 en 1 heure): le rôle de son fils Donald Jr dans cette réunion d\\'août 2016...qui redouble EXACTEMENT son rôle face aux émissaires russes 2 mois plus tôt en juin 2016.\\n4) Le problème de la réponse de #Trump et de ses partisans sur réseaux sociaux (dont il serait intéressant de connaître l\\'origine) est qu\\'elle omet justement la force du #breaking du @nytimes: #Mueller n\\'envisage pas 1 collusion DIFFERENTE de celle avec la #Russie mais liée...\\n3) Sur la méthode, c\\'est très intéressant car hier, immédiatement depuis la publication du @nytimes, on a vu des milliers de comptes pro-#Trump \"rôder\" et diffuser cet argument: #Mueller n\\'a rien trouvé sur la #Russie, alors il va chercher Arabie Saoudite, EAU et Israël...\\n14) Autre énorme problème pour #Trump père et fils, il faut le rappeler...ces interventions étrangères dans 1 campagne fédérale sont RIGOUREUSEMENT illégales. #Alire cette note de la commission électorale fédérale US. https://t.co/ayp1HdYJ1F\\n8) #Prince était donc déjà soupçonné de parjure lors de son témoignage au Congrès. Mais avec le #breaking du @nytimes d\\'hier, le parjure devient évident car #Prince n\\'a JAMAIS mentionné la rencontre montée en août 2016 pour #Trump... https://t.co/551LBoiiel',\n",

       " 'Some illustrative Clayborne quotes from Red Mars. \"Unique geology and chemistry... the land has to be thoroughly studied before we can start changing it.\" \"Mars is its own place.\" \"You can\\'t just wipe out a 3-billion-year-old planetary surface\" ...\\nBut which historical processes/entities have value? Wilderness is about valuing ecological mechanisms that maintain landscape. Naturalness (unmodified by humans) is one factor in determining environmental value. We value forest/river b/c they represent world outside our dominion.\\nAutonomy: if an entity\\'s existing/functioning is independent of us, then we should recognize it also has value independent on us.\\nBut some of this Leopold fella\\'s ideas apply. Conquerer role (colonialism) causes bad shit. Soil/water/etc should not be seen as \"resources\" but as entities with right to continuous existence. On what basis should Mars be considered our resource?\\n#SoCIA18 is about to go back on with \"Thinking like a Red: A Consideration of the Ethics of Terraforming in light of Kim Stanley Robinson\\'s RED MARS,\" by Roberta Millstein.\\nThis talk is focusing on Ann Clayborne, inadvertent founder of Reds anti-terraforming movement in the KSR books. What exactly ARE her views/arguments? They are never stated directly in the book.\\nTheme3: Mars independent of us (not for/because of us). Similar theme from philosophy: Non-Teleology. We value humans for independent (non-instrumental) existence, so for consistency, we should value non-human entities w/ independent existence.\\n@threadreaderapp unroll\\nTheme4 (no mirror image/artifact): Follows from themes 2+3, because terraforming would destroy its causal continuity with the processes that created it. We\\'d also destroy its autonomy (exists for self, not dependent on us).\\nTheme5 (consistent environmental ethic): Builds on last 4 themes, plus Aldo Leopold\\'s Land Ethic: interdependence of biotic &amp; abiotic elements. Buuuut, hard to apply that to an abiotic Mars.\\nWe are (for this argument) assuming no indigenous Mars life, so any obligations are toward Mars itself &amp; the non-living features. We are pro-spacegoing, but difference between \"boldly go\" and \"boldly terraform\" (learn vs transform)\\n...\"[after terraforming it] we\\'ll wonder why, when we look at the land, we can never see anyting but our own faces.\" \"Being the consciousness of the universe does not mean turning it all into a mirror image of us.\"\\nTheme1: Scientific/aesthetic. These are anthropocentric reasons, so (while good) are insufficient - they have to compete against other anthropocentric considerations.\\nCan understanding her arguments help us formulate our own arguments about/against terraforming? It seems like Ann is groping for ideas that remain poorly grasped.\\nFive themes: 1. Scientific &amp; aesthetic reasons not to terraform. 2. History of mars (age &amp; processes) have value. 3. Mars is independent of humans. 4. Mars shouldn\\'t be turned into human artifact. 5. We need consistent environmental ethic across planets.\\nTheme2: History Has Value. Origins of objects are part of their explanations - including wilderness\\' causal continuity with the past. (Argument prev used to compare natural areas to art.)\\nSo add that last bit to our initial list of values: 6. Rejection of Conquerer Role and the attitude that casts non-human entities as human \"resources.\"\\n\\nIs this defensible? Great question! This talk was just here to define the position.',\n",

       " 'Trump has also repeatedly stated that unauthorized immigrants cost the US a lot of money. That is not true. 9 #lie #fakenews #racist #bigot \\xa0https://t.co/0Zenx33w24\\nHow this relates to #DACA and #immigration: Trump’s admin is using a racist &amp; biased narrative to establish immigrants as “others”, or an out-group. He uses claims that have been de-bunked to make immigrants look like bad people. 5 #falsenarrative #lie #LiarinChief #Blotus https://t.co/bTsTHsPcxb\\nPeople in power define social identities as they have the means to control the narrative – news coverage, platforms to broadcast their platforms, &amp; the power to influence law enforcement and legislation. Social identity affects how people perceive themselves and others. 3 https://t.co/sTrKxTW5mR\\nPeople want to differentiate themselves from out-groups, as they have negative images. The in-group is united in differentiating itself from the out-group. It’s “us v. them”. 4 https://t.co/2aexzrGFwk #sociology https://t.co/VOVG5acWG1\\nThe current dialogue about #DACA affects everyone in the US.

THREAD 1 #DreamActNow #immigration https://t.co/W8pRLNvT7b\\nTrump repeats the idea that unauthorized immigrants commit a lot of crime, so getting rid of immigrants will bring down crime &amp; keep Americans safe. But the facts don’t back that up. 6 #prejudice #racism https://t.co/7RAL1KTInX\\nScapegoating minorities is an effective way to put them in the role of “out-groups”. Trump blames Muslims for terrorism and unauthorized immigrants (specifically Latinos) for crime to build support for his Muslim ban, border wall and anti-immigrant policies. 8 https://t.co/YRinIMYywT\\nThe sociological concept of the “other” is important to this discussion. If you haven’t heard of it before, here is a brief overview from https://t.co/dXL54ysqAS. 2 #identity #race #sociology #Science https://t.co/SL2URYBB6o\\nBy repeating these lies, Trump has effectively established #immigrants as an “other”, or “out-group” of bad and dangerous people. Blaming #minority groups for societal problems is called #scapegoating, and it’s not new. 7 https://t.co/3jTGZDn6cc\\nWhy is critical thinking so important? Because Trump meets almost all of the warning signs of fascism. We HAVE to be aware of that to fight it. That means keeping our eyes open, evaluating the facts, and thinking critically. #Democracy depends on it. https://t.co/DR6A5zge72\\nEight years of Obama caused a backlash from people who previously kept their racism hidden. We’ve seen this in the way that so many people dismissed and excused Trump’s racist statements. Some said Trump didn’t mean what he said. 13 #denial #rationalize https://t.co/bDiWDbeb2A\\nTrump’s claims about unauthorized immigrants have been proven false. He keeps repeating them to emphasize the idea that unauthorized immigrants are bad for the U.S. and it’s best to deport them. 11 #TrumpLies #LiarinChief #LiaroftheYear https://t.co/mZkomKa60q\\nThat proved untrue in both cases. Trump’s #MuslimBan, #BorderWall, his attempt to ban #trans troops, his support of “religious freedom” laws &amp; his “shithole” remarks show his racism. 15 https://t.co/koMpgyhTlL #Trumpisawhitesupremacist\\nScapegoating gives people who are angry and frustrated an outlet for their aggression on a target that can’t strike back. It’s a “safe” release valve for unhappy constituents to focus on and unite against. 13\\n\\nhttps://t.co/rWFriVbNSS\\nWhy is Trump so anti-immigrant if the facts don’t back up his statements? His family has a long history of racism, dating back to the 1970’s. 12 https://t.co/C67qtUuL1T\\n@threadreaderapp please unroll.\\nWhat’s the takeaway here? Be aware of these tactics.

Si l\\'acte de Mueller ne parle pas de collusion, il évoque des communications unwitting (sans le savoir) entre Russes et campagne Trump\\n4) La\"remontrance\" de #Trump à McMaster est d\\'autant plus symbolique que le conseiller sécurité nationale s\\'était exprimé sur  la même scène que Lavrov le ministre russe ayant dénoncé les inculpations comme du baratin...devinez qui dénonce le président US...\\n13) Enjeu no.2 des jours (heures?) à venir: le général McMaster, plus brillant produit de l\\'armée US, passé par tous les terrains de bataille, acceptera-t-il cette énième rebuffade, lui le néo-conservateur déjà souvent en désaccord avec #Trump?\\n15)...car force est de constater, sans que cela prouve la collusion à priori, que le président #Trump accomplit TRES EXACTEMENT les objectifs des conspirateurs russes révélés par #Mueller: créer la désunion nationale, saper la foi US dans les institutions (cf. justice et FBI) etc\\n7) On retrouve aussi la conception\"verticale\" du pouvoir de #Trump qui souhaite 1 loyauté à sa personne et non à la fonction (il\"invite\" McMaster à critiquer la collusion de #Clinton avec les Russes) ainsi qu\\'1 autorité judiciaire subordonnée directement à l\\'exécutif\\n9) Le couperet s\\'est donc rapproché avec ces 1ères inculpations de #Mueller POUR l\\'ingérence de la #Russie et cela déplaît totalement à #Trump par hypothèse pour 2 raisons différentes...\\n18) Vendredi, le procureur #Mueller acte 1 interférence majeure de la #Russie contre la démocratie US. Depuis lors, le président #Trump a fait 14 tweets sur ce sujet. 7 pour se défendre de la collusion.5 pour charger les démocrates,2 contre FBI et enquêtes. ZERO contre la #Russie\\n10) Hypothèse 1: #Trump n\\'a rien à se reprocher quant à 1 éventuelle collusion avec la #Russie mais ne supporte pas que l\\'ingérence mise au jour par #Mueller vienne lui\"voler sa victoire\" ou la ternir. C\\'est compatible avec son narcissisme bien connu.\\n19) Et si vous vous demandiez pourquoi je passe mon temps à analyser les tweets de #Trump comme mode d\\'expression sur l\\'enquête #Mueller et la #Russie, précision méthodologique et comptable essentielle de @thomassnegaroff . RT+ https://t.co/1Hj794Hn3e\\n12) Dans les 2 hypothèses, la bataille ultime #Trump/#Mueller commence. 1er enjeu: à défaut de pouvoir virer le procureur, va-t-il se servir de la faute du FBI à #Parkland pour débarquer Wray qu\\'il avait nommé à la place de Comey et pas encore assez\"docile\"?\\n17) Dans 1 même série de tweets, #Trump peut rendre #Obama et les démocrates responsables de l\\'interférence russe, blâmer les commissions d\\'enquête sur cette interférence et appeler les Américains à cesser la discorde partisane...il n\\'y a aucune cohérence.https://t.co/3BCVCASTTE\\n14) Et toujours la même question: si #Trump veut démontrer l\\'absurdité de toute collusion et indiquer à la #Russie l\\'échec de son plan\"discorde\", pourquoi ne parle-t-il pas fort et clair contre Moscou...au lieu de semer le doute sur les institutions clés de la démocratie US?\\n11) Hypothèse 2: #Trump sait que sa campagne a fauté avec les Russes- de manière pas nécessairement calculée (cf. par exemple la rencontre de son fils en juin 2016 qu\\'il a déjà essayée de couvrir). Et il a compris que #Mueller se rapproche.\\n2)...et pour faire bonne mesure, toujours à 1 heure avancée, #Trump s\\'est servi de la tragédie de #Parkland pour\"assassiner\"le #FBI qui enquêterait trop sur la Russie et pas assez sur les \"vraies\"menaces...#inédit RT https://t.co/Ie3H1pV8WT\\n3) Résumons les faits et vous verrez que le #breaking est d\\'ampleur.

       " \"Startups, on the other hand, have to put much more effort into building their teams. Every hire is from outside the company. You have to sell people on your vision, the ambiguous role, that you will still be around to pay their salary and health care in six months.\\n2) In the startup community, early-stage failure is often tolerated and even celebrated.\\n\\nPeople understand what an accomplishment it is to have built a startup and are eager to hire people for a next gig. Failure is a badge of honor and is seen as eventually leading to success.\\nTrue story: We once wrapped an ethernet cable around the outside of our high-rise office building like a clothesline from the 19th to 18th floor to get internet to our sales team.\\n\\nI bought the cable bulk from Home Depot and tried to pick a subtle color so we wouldn’t get caught.\\n1) The most fundamental, pervasive background thread of an early-stage startup is that when it fails, everyone has find a new job. The company is gone, kaput, relegated to the dustbin of Crunchbase.\\n\\nThe company literally lives &amp; dies on the work every employee does every day.\\nIn fact, in a big company “startup” you often get the coolest space and the best perks.\\n\\nTeams are set up in a “garage” or “innovation lab” decked out with modern amenities, cool showcase design elements, and state-of-the-art hardware and workspaces.\\nThere’s no such thing as a “startup inside of a big company.”\\n\\nThis misnomer actively misleads both big company employees working in such teams as well as people toiling in actual startups.\\n\\nDespite all best efforts to create megacorp “startups”, they can never exist. Here's why:\\n4) A big company “startup” product is sold and promoted with the resources of the big company behind it.\\n\\nEven if you are a “just” a 30-person team, when you do Fast Company to show the cool thing you incubated, it’s with the implicit megaphone of a Google or Facebook behind you.\\nAll of this is not to say that “innovation teams” inside of big companies shouldn’t exist, or that they are bad places to work.\\n\\nThese teams might well be fun, with smart people and great perks. They may produce interesting products.\\n\\nBut they are certainly not a startup.\\nIn a real early-stage startup, you are taking out the trash yourself. If you want a drink, you buy it. You build your own desk.\\n\\nThis can actually be a fun part of startup life; it teaches you to take less for granted and creates a tangible sense of ownership in the company.\\nReal startups naturally attract people willing to embrace the risk/ambiguity in return for bigger challenges, autonomy, faster learning, and more ownership/upside.\\n\\nWhen I read megacorp resumes that say they work “in a startup,” I try not to judge. They don’t know how it sounds.\\nOn the other hand, early-stage work that any 20-person “startup” team does inside of a 50,000 person company can’t cause that entire company to fail.\\n\\nThe physics dictate that it is impossible. (It is also why some people prefer the stability of big company jobs, and that’s ok!)\\nYou’ve got a field sales team ready to sell what you’ve created. A marketing/PR engine ready to promote it. The name, goodwill, and trust that your company has created with customers.\\n\\nThese are all incalculably valuable, and often forgotten or taken for granted.\\nIn many big companies, on the other hand, taking a risk and failing often puts the stench of failure on the people who tried, leading to career stagnation at the hands of those who chose the “safer” path of sticking with the cash cows that are going to make money no matter what.\\nThese all seem like small things, but creating a functioning, humane workplace for people to do great work can take a lot of time, thought, and resources.\\n\\nEmulating the startup “garage” atmosphere inside of a big company is all of the glamour without all of the garbage.\\n3) Big company “startups” start off with the existing infrastructure of a megacorp. The company provides snacks and drinks. Someone takes care of custodial, finding you office space, makes sure you have sweet conference rooms, benefits, hardware, access to software and services.\\n(And, by the way, I ran one of these “startups inside of a big company” myself and at the time thought it was basically a startup.\\n\\nWe had a cool name. We were small, lean, and agile and dreaming about the future and had a $50,000 3D printer. This was not a startup. I was wrong.)\\n5) Hiring in a big company “startup” is often more like a draft, where you get to pick the “best &amp; brightest” from other teams to rapidly fill your headcount.\\n\\nTeams can quickly ramp to 30, 50, 100+ people, with plenty of money to pay them and loads of readily-available talent.\\nAs someone who made a transition from a big “center of the tech world” company to founding a company, I didn’t realize how much I assumed that when we created new stuff, the world would pay attention to it.\\n\\nNo such luck.

And it\\'s interesting how since the referendum, it is only this narrow band of London Brexiters are recycled on Question Time and all the panel shows, as if no other Brexit campaigns ever existed. The poison of institutional prestige at work.\\n7. Westley pretends these are adjuncts to the EU relationship rather than an integral part of the treaties and a matter for secession negotiations. This is how they can pretend that a no deal option is not as bad as it would appear.\\n8. But even supposing we had been able to tie up things like Euratom and an aviation agreement, that still ignores all the other areas of technical integration. https://t.co/fcR00hDMLp\\n12. Vote Leave and its cock puppets and zombie organisations all trace back to Tufton Street and the same handful of largely anonymous donors pushing their version of disaster capitalism - re-writing the script to pretend the leave vote was a mandate for their agenda.\\n10.

But it\\'s the usual suspects... https://t.co/Tjvt0976Be\\n16. So what you got here is a useful idiot with an epic case of Dunning Kruger Syndrome doing the dirty work of \"free trade\" ideologues who haven\\'t the first idea how modern trade works or indeed what an act of self-immolation a hostile termination of relations would be.\\n19. So long as they can keep the debate polarised for long enough they can massage the notion that anyone who wants an intelligent negotiated settlement is somehow a traitor to democracy - or a \"technocrat elitist\".\\n20. The TPA, Westley\\'s employer has a long track record of pushing the most extreme libertarian nonsense - wedded to the bogus and juvenile deregulation mantras of the IEA which ceased to be relevant in 1950. These people are practised liars, frauds and pretenders.\\n2. Vote Leave never had a plan. They could never even agree on whether to use Article 50. Later on in the campaign the VL website published their favoured mode of exit, not using A50 and simply repealing the European Communities Act.\\n13. In reality Vote Leave was a parasite that hijacked the campaign, took total ownership of it and in the end the vote was a rejection of the establishment rather than an endorsement of the poorly communicated Vote Leave \"plan\".\\n18. You will not that they only ever keep the debate on the most superficial level, avoiding any of the technical details because they deliberately want to keep it a binary issue - and know full well they would be utterly trounced on the mechanics of leaving.\\nIn which Chloe Westley lies about Vote Leave having a plan and deliberately pretends that no deal does not mean no deal. London #Brexit luvvies are every bit as contemptible as the worst of the anti-democrat remainers. https://t.co/XPkpQoH2NB\\n3. That\\'s the equivalent of just tearing up the treaties and seeing what happens - making no provisions for trade, or any of the other three hundred areas of economic cooperation including space, maritime surveillance and fishing. ie total collapse of every regulatory system.\\n4. That is not by anyone\\'s definition a plan to disentangle ourselves from forty years of EU membership. There wasn\\'t even a plan to handle the fallout of doing so. You\\'d have to redefine the meaning of the word plan to call it a plan.\\n5. Westley then has the nerve to say that this was the \"vision\" the public voted for. Again, Vote Leave seeking to own the narrative. She then claims that leaving without a trade deal is \"not necessarily a problem\". Seriously!\\n11. Pretty much every word that comes out of this woman\\'s mouth is a flat lie. What we have here is your pretty typical London circle jerk girlie rep who knows fuck all about nine tenths of anything but they roll her out to to the media as a break from dreary cobwebbed tories,\\n14. Not surprising then that Westley can often be found at the same events as the intellectual pygmies of Spiked Online and their respective knitting circles who see sovereignty as an entirely binary affair where global governance doesn\\'t even exist.\\n9. She also insets the bizarre claim that it would be better for the taxpayer to spend 1.2bn on preparations for no deal, implying that is better value than settling our financial obligation as a means to retain a £240bn a year trade relationship.\\n6. Bizarrely she then claims we should have arranged to sign bilaterals to \"avoid major disruption\" before triggering article 50. Except of course, Malmstroem, Barnier and Juncker all said there would be no negotiations of any kind until A50 was triggered.\\n15. Westley sounds superficially plausible to anyone who wasn\\'t actually involved in the pre-referendum debate, but it is a fact that the gaping hole in Vote Leave was the absence of a plan and a total inability to agree on an exit strategy let alone a long term vision.',\n",

       " '3) Here’s something it took me a long time to learn on the outside: say “I” instead of “we.”\\n\\nWorking for @stevesi at MSFT, I learned an incredibly important lesson about leading inside of a large team: always say “we did this” not “I did this.” Perfect advice for that situation.\\nLeaving a big company job for a startup can rejuvenate your career and make you love work again.💖\\n\\nBut landing a startup job requires relearning some things, especially if (like me) you logged years and years at Microgoogfaceforceazon.\\n\\nHere are six things I wish I\\'d known:\\n1) At a startup, you will probably make less money at first.\\n\\nYes, if you join the perfect startup early enough, your equity may someday turn into a private island and 200 foot yacht. But, in the meantime, your take home pay is likely going to be a bit less than it is now.\\nThe so-called “golden handcuffs” that big companies give you in stock grants/bonuses that vest over time are because those companies need to overpay you in order to get you to stay.\\n\\nThink about the metaphor for a second: You don\\'t have to handcuff people to things they love.\\nYou can make a great living at a startup of course, and growth stage startups in particular pay competitively and often with fantastic benefits. \\n\\nBut if optimizing for the most take home cash is your #1 priority, keep your job. Seriously… it’s ok. Startups are not for everyone.\\nAlso, leave off whatever “high potential” programs you were selected to, or awards you won inside of the megacorp. Same with review scores.\\n\\nThose don’t matter on the outside, and just show that you\\'re still deeply entrenched in the value system of the company you\\'re leaving.\\nWhen I left Microsoft after 16 years, I had worked on what seemed to me to be a dizzying array of roles and products. Within Microsoft, that was compelling.\\n\\nTo the external world, it was just 16 monolithic years at MSFT and everyone asked pointedly: why didn’t you leave sooner?\\nWhen interviewing, though, saying “we did this\" makes it hard to identify your personal contribution.\\n\\nI find myself talking to megacorp candidates trying to understand what did *they* do? What specific designs did they draw… what code did they write… what ideas were theirs?\\n2) About your resume: if you’ve been at a big company for a long time, you really need to figure out what experiences you’ve had that show depth outside of that company.\\n\\nWrote apps for an unfamiliar platform? Started a nonprofit? Ran a successful Kickstarter campaign? All great.\\nThis means if you work for Amazon, build something on DigitalOcean. Googler? Build with React. From Microsoft? Get into AWS.\\n\\nThe best big company devs we’ve hired are the ones with natural, proven technical curiosity outside of their company’s native stack, shown by actual work.\\n4) For devs: show true curiosity outside of your company’s stack. Your mastery of Google’s internal experimentation pipeline is not interesting outside of Google. If you are MSFT and I ask you if you’ve used Redis and you say “you mean Azure Redis Cache?”, that’s not a good sign.\\nThere’s a whole world out here, free from the walls of your megacorp job.\\n\\nEnter into it for the right reasons, and you\\'ll find joining a startup to be truly transformative for your career and rejuvenating for your soul.\\n\\nPrepare for it the right way, and you too can join us! 🙌\\n5) Be a worker… and be prepared to show it.\\n\\nBig companies are necessarily full of people whose primary job it is to carry information from one meeting to another, from one department to another. Middle managers and PMs, in particular, are often defined by this type of work.\\nDon’t feel like you have to be on your back foot or defensive about your time at a megacorp.\\n\\nIt took me a year out of Microsoft to realize that so much of what I learned there was applicable in my new startup job—i just needed to learn to apply it in a different environment.\\n6) Embrace the unique skills you developed in a big company. No one builds more reliable software at scale than Amazon or Google… this knowledge can be a huge boon to a startup. Salesforce perfected solution-based selling; this may help scale your SaaS startup’s sales expertise.\\nDon’t say the reason you want to join a startup is “to have a chance to learn XYZ technology.” Learn and build with the tech you are curious about yourself… your company is not in control of your learning. Prove that you’re curious by actions, not words.\\nStartups don’t have this kind of “info pusher” job. They can’t afford to, and they’re not big enough to need it. Everyone is responsible for making something, building product, owning decisions, selling something, hustling. You can’t just show up at the meeting and “seem senior.”\\nBig company folks sometimes flame out at startups because this kind of individual work is not what they actually want. No judgment from me or anyone else if it’s not… be honest with yourself about the degree to which you want to be on the frontlines, making or selling things.\\nBut also, don’t claim personal accomplishment for a team effort unless you provably did it. You probably didn’t “bring AI to iOS” yourself.\\n\\nYou didn’t “create the Windows 7 kernel” or “increase S3’s scalability 400%” yourself.\\n\\nSpecify *your* actual contribution to the product.',\n",

       " '1. Catching up on #Q post analyses: #QAnon had mentioned a reference to Deep Dream on Feb 18.  Looking into it took time because it took 96 hours to process my 90 second video \\n\\nfrom this: https://t.co/BvnGCKATv5\\n\\ninto this: https://t.co/n1WMTAz2Qx - rather devilish!\\n4. So it appears that #Q was telling us that Google was using it\\'s AI technology to operate the twitter bots, NOT \"Russia\". But see next tweet: No. 5\\n#QAnon\\n2. It turns out that #QAnon had confirmed to us then that \\n\\nDEEP DREAM= TWITTER, &amp; that it was related to the sudden loss of twitter followers that many of us had suddenly sustained very shortly after #Q\\'s post. But what @Snowden had to do with it was a matter of much speculation https://t.co/Yve0xu6YfM\\n5. So @prayingmedic had noticed a post that is very significant to exactly what #Q was telling us: An #Anon claiming to be a Google employee posted it on 4chan. It details Google\\'s plan to use AI to push political narratives on social media! #QAnon Wow! https://t.co/CIw1Lsl9Vt\\n3. So, since then, #QAnon posted last Sat an interesting bit: \\n\\n\"Projection.&lt;-----------------------------Attribution of blame outward\\nRussia&gt;D/HRC&lt;------------------------We\\'re supposed to think not DNC\\nTwitter Bots&gt;GOOG operated (not Russia)/Narrative &amp; Political &lt;-Google!\\n#Q https://t.co/dIg7hnOdnu\\n@threadreaderapp please unroll\\n13. Illustrative of the #DeepStateInPanic #MockingbirdMedia LameStream efforts, #Q shares w us a video with phony canned laughter, phonier than the #Clowns\\' \"anti-muslim\" video for #Benghazi coverup. They mischaracterize an anon\\'s question as #QAnon\\'s prediction. Can\\'t even read. https://t.co/bkv4pSNLna\\n16. Rod Rosenstein\\'s lawyer wife has represented:\\n\\nRobert Muller 3x\\nJames Comey 5x\\nBarack Obama 45x\\nKathleen Sebelius 56x\\nBill Clinton 40x\\nHillary 17x\\n\\n\"Historically this indicates that the individual is a protected clown op\" https://t.co/agF7OrCDd3\\n\\n#Q: \"follow the wives\" #QAnon https://t.co/YMwIitEaEu\\n9. Since #QAnon\\'s 3 \"booms\" predictions last week, now this week:\\n\\nBoom - McCabe fired\\nBoom - Tillerson fired\\nBoom - McMaster fired\\n\\nAfter Cohn\\'d been fired he had told us previously to \"expect more\" - #Q\\n7.\\nMZ. = Mark Zuckerberg of facebook\\nRT.  = Rizvi Traverse (most think), Rex Tillerson (unlikely)?\\n1 former intel dir  = wow!\\n\\n#QAnon is maybe mocking @Snowden having left a back door open here, some think. #Q is showing world they know about meeting and so, that plan will \"FAIL\" https://t.co/gnnaeiWHkg\\n11. #Q predicted that rooting out the #DeepState friendlies would put them into \"panic mode\" granting that we may \"enjoy the show\", the \"March madness\" show. #QAnon https://t.co/6Y58jzmIcY\\n8. So a lot has changed in a week\\'s time, &amp; #QAnon had told us to expect it this week. Only a little over a week ago anons were worried #Sessions would let McCabe skate, but #Q told us to \"trust the plan\" the eve before #McCabe was fired!   Q predicted 3 \"booms\" for this week. https://t.co/gAQyw8CCfn\\n6. Then on Wed this wk #QAnon tells us:\\n\\n\"We have the algorithm.\\nThank you @ Snowden.\\n#Q\"\\n\\nThis has interpreted to mean that @Snowden was serving a white hat function in cooperating with #QAnon in the reveal of the Google AI algorithm being used on social media to censor speech. https://t.co/8AGDwxNm6h\\n14. The above #fakenews hit on us falsely stated (to canned laughter) that #Q predicted #HRC\\'s arrest in October. Instead, Q was clarifying that they were only keeping track of her border crossings. It was well worth re-reading all of #QAnon\\'s Oct posts: https://t.co/ePdjfNk3Es\\n10. Last Sat #QAnon was referring to \"TRUMP ADMIN v2\", version 2 of the Trump administration, BEFORE this week\\'s changes.  Was #Q posing the question as to whether Flynn maybe serving a role, \"know[ing] where the bodies are buried\"? https://t.co/VD0zSaYFWP\\n12. #Q had told us on Wenesday that, laughably, #DeepState #FBI holdovers had opened up a file on #QAnon because of his \"boom boom\" statements. More significantly, Q predicts the Austin bomber\\'s death 4am Wednesday, hours before he exploded himself in his car. Wow. https://t.co/LdN0jxJtjo\\n15. #Q refers to the extent of our government\\'s corruption - bad!\\nMany anons\\' consensus re #QAnon\\'s post here:\\nFBI - mueller comey mccabe\\nDOJ - holder lynch rosenstein \\nState - hrc kerry \\nPlus another 29,18,and 41 ppl respectively in those depts yet. https://t.co/sYnb5P1aDr',\n",

Leaving the EU does nowt to weaken the train operator position, but does screw up workers &amp; suppliers within it &amp; Network Rail.\\nIndeed, far from being a barrier to nationalisation, EU law actively encourages it, by promotion of municipal control of local rail &amp; utilities. Perfect for a devolved administration such as London, Manchester, Wales and Scotland. Since they set buy-back agenda on demand.\\nThis isn\\'t just my view.

It promotes market liberalisation. A different thing. It wants suppliers to provide competitive value for public money.\\nIt\\'s British in the eyes of HMRC, Company\\'s House and, where applicable, in Law. So his plan, if shutting the borders is it, for this purpose, simply won\\'t work. It\\'s garbage. Why? Several reasons.\\nDistribution networks are overseen by Ofgem, not any body in the EU (albeit some EU directives on safety &amp; regulations on procurement etc. apply, but they apply regardless).\\n\\nSo @jeremycorbyn is kicking people out of the UK and limiting his options for nothing!\\nNo great secret. @jeremycorbyn is an idiot. As perhaps are some of @UKLabour support.\\n\\nThis will highlight a lot of what\\'s wrong with Corbyn\\'s nationalisation position but remember the Tories are worse overall.

Un Anglais ?\\nLes Anglais sont rétifs, mais ils n\\'ont objectivement que peu d\\'arguments à faire valoir.\\n1) 26 mars 1918 : à l\\'hôtel de ville de Doullens (Somme), Raymond Poincaré, président de la République, et Georges Clemenceau, président du Conseil, rencontrent Alfred Milner, secrétaire d\\'État à la Guerre et Douglas Haig, chef du corps expéditionnaire britannique.\\n#Thread ⤵️ https://t.co/PZYvTuJ5QW\\n12) 21 divisions de la XVIIIe armée allemande enfoncent les IIIe et Ve armées britanniques. La Ve notamment s\\'effondre complètement.\\nLe 23, les Allemands prennent Péronne, Bapaume tombe le lendemain.\\nDes dizaines de milliers d\\'habitants sont évacués.\\n5) C\\'est même tout le contraire. Le 3 mars 1918, Allemands et Russes signent le traité de Brest-Litovsk. Les combats prennent fin à l\\'est.\\nLes Allemands peuvent rapatrier leurs troupes vers l\\'ouest pour forcer la décision.\\n3) Sauf que pas du tout. Les américains d\\'abord. Entrés en guerre un an plus tôt, en avril 1917, leur effort commence à peine à se faire sentir. Il n\\'est pas encore décisif.\\nLorsqu\\'ils entrent en guerre, les américains n\\'ont pas de matériel lourd, pas d\\'armée de métier.\\n9) Les troupes d\\'assaut Allemandes, les Sturmtruppen, constituent le fer de lance de l\\'offensive allemande.\\nHindenburg et Ludendorff cherchent à séparer les Anglais des Français, battre les uns puis les autres pour les forcer à signer une paix favorable au Reich.\\n8) Car en ce printemps 1918, la physionomie même de la guerre vient de changer : on revient à la guerre de mouvement connue à l\\'été 1914.\\nLe 21 mars, les Allemands sortent de leurs tranchées, et attaquent les Britanniques.\\n6) Leur objectif et de disposer rapidement d\\'une supériorité numérique avant que les Sammies ne soient présent en nombre.\\nUn truc va beaucoup les aider pour ça : le train.\\nLes chemins de fer allemands sont, de loin, les plus performants parmi les belligérants.\\n11) \"Sale rosbif !\" vitupère l\\'un. \"Fucking froggy !\" répond l\\'autre. Haig ne parle que de défendre Amiens et la liaison avec la Manche, Pétain veut à tout prix protéger la route de Paris.\\nLe 21 mars, donc, les Allemands attaquent les Anglais.\\n10) Car en face, c\\'est moyennement l\\'entente cordiale entre Français et Anglais. Chacun commande ses propres troupes, avec des objectifs qui sont souvent différents voire contradictoires.\\nDouglas Haig et Philippe Pétain ne peuvent clairement pas se blairer.\\n15) Depuis bientôt 4 ans, c\\'est le territoire français qui est ravagé par la guerre.\\nDepuis bientôt 4 ans, c\\'est la France qui fournit la majeure part de l\\'effort de guerre allié.\\nLe corps expéditionnaire britannique est au bord de l\\'effondrement.\\n13) Le front franco-britannique est rompu. Chez les Anglais, on commence à se demander si on va pouvoir continuer comme ça et si on ne devrait pas commencer à prendre langue avec le \"Hun\".\\nChez les Français, plusieurs généraux rechignent à prêter main forte aux alliés Anglais.\\n2) Nos quatre hommes et le reste des délégations n\\'en mènent pas large : en un mot, ça fouette sévère.\\nOn imagine souvent à tort qu\\'en 1918, la guerre est gagnée. Les Teutons refluent en désordre, la guerre gross malheur, les américains sont là, on a des chars.\\n16) Et puis surtout, on flippe à mort. On voit déjà les Allemands marcher sur Paris et les Anglais rembarquer à Dunkerque (22 ans avant...).\\nIl faut s\\'entendre. Il faut que l\\'on puisse coordonner les efforts alliés. Question de vie ou de mort.\\n17) Alors on s\\'entend. Les Anglais s\\'inclinent, le candidat Français, Ferdinand Foch est choisi.\\nIl se voit confier la mission de \"coordonner l\\'action des armées alliées sur le front ouest\".\\nIl décide immédiatement de défendre Amiens et de lancer des contre-offensives.\\n19) Leurs meilleurs divisions ont été très éprouvées, les pertes sont lourdes.\\nDos au mur, Français et Anglais ont réussi à faire taire leurs dissensions pour contrer le danger immédiat.\\nLa guerre n\\'est pas encore gagnée. Mais au moins, elle n\\'est pas déjà perdue.\\n\\n/fin.\\n18) Dès le lendemain, 27 mars, les nouvelles offensives allemandes échouent. Les Français prêtent main forte aux Anglais.\\nBien qu\\'ayant réussi à enfoncer le front franco-britannique, les Allemands n\\'ont pas réussi à prendre Amiens ou Compiègne.',\n",

       " '4/ The recent push by #AIM about the #SES may have caused AIM to be targeted. How do we interpret the claims by AIM?\\n19/ The recent disinfo campaign and direct attack on #QAnon\\'s GA board today compel us to analyze. Please retweet/comment to engage a vigorous analysis/discussion. Our goal should be the #Truth and not to prove an embedded position.\\n/END\\n11/g. They claim that the current Q is anti-Semitic…based on WHAT evidence??\\nh. #AIM also specifically attacks other channels that are clearly on the side of patriots and truth. This is a classic \"divide and conquer\" strategy of the #Clowns.\\n12/ i. They claim to \"be smarter than the public\" (having solved the \"puzzle\" in minutes) and to have been invited into #Q\\'s Club.\\nThis behavior is 100% contrary to the Q movement (\"Where we go one, we go ALL\"), displaying the very \"elitism\" that we are fighting.\\n10/ e. They WILL NOT DISCLOSE how they figured out the original #Q to be legit…nor how they debunked the current one.\\nf. They also claim specific knowledge that #Sessions (\"we won\\'t reveal what we have on him\") is compromised but will not disclose it.\\n15/ k. Important to remember: #Q warned us that \"they want you DIVIDED.\" The logical conclusion is either that #AIM is a #disnifo/#psyop channel or that it has been compromised.\\n16/ I believe that the latter interpretation is more likely based on their prior history, especially given the events that happened on the #8chan board a few hours ago. They were either threatened or have been trapped by their own arrogance into their current assessment.\\n9/ …and of foreknowledge of events (BDT bomber, Hawaiian missile alert, NK deal, use of Omnibus deal to fund building the wall via Army Corps of Engineers). Look at 3/23 post https://t.co/WXPoHas6kU\\nvis-à-vis #POTUS\\' 3/25 tweet https://t.co/vHd4LYeYop\\n2/ The question of #QAnon being a LARP has been debated, but there\\'s huge evidence that #Q is real and very directly tied to #POTUS. Many, I believe correctly, speculate that Q is military intelligence (possibly #GeneralFlynn) or at least uses this for some sourcing.\\n8/ d. They falsely claim #Q has not shown confirmations w/in 3 weeks of predictions. This is easily disproven by the dozens of confirmations of Q…of connections to #POTUS (tweets, images from Air Force One, pen at Camp David, \"chain of command,\" hand gestures in speeches, etc.)\\n5/ Here is my analysis: There are many factors that serve to debunk the #AIM video that tries to debunk #QAnon as legit, namely:\\na. They claim that @jerome_corsi says he has communicated directly w/#Q. This is absolutely not true.\\n7/ c. They claim that #Q could NOT be a close insider since the release of the info would be a national security violation that would put them in jail. This is NOT THE CASE if it is a true insider w/authorization from #POTUS, who can declassify ANYTHING.\\n13/ In case it helps, they claim the #puzzle they solved is encrypted in this message:\\n\"Eagles rain fire on the Canaanite as the merchant of wine challenges Sirus. The sword of Lilly joins forces with Jacob\\'s adopted children.\"\\n17/ To conclude, all evidence...the many confirmations and the escalating attacks on #Q and efforts at division of #Patriots...point to #QAnon being a legit insider source providing real intel.\\n3/ Recently, a YouTube channel \"American Intelligence Media\" (AIM) claimed that Q is a LARP/#Psyop. This was upsetting to many as it has seemed that #AIM is dedicated to exposing the cabal and the #DeepState, w/a rightfully-heavy focus on the #SeniorExecutiveService (#SES).\\n1/ Is #QAnon legit? I started typing this thread this morning. It\\'s more urgent to post and share this given the attack on #Q on the Great Awakening board this afternoon. The attack confirms that my assessment that #QAnon is over the target is, in fact, on target.\\n6/ b. They claim that #QAnon contacted them directly. Q said he would engage in \"No comms privately w/ anyone.\"[...]\\n14/ j. The idea that #Q was shut down by the cabal, who took control for a psyop, w/o making an effort to communicate this fact over many months is ludicrous. Also, it is hubris by #AIM to think that Q would target a relatively small YT channel w/60K subscribers.',\n",

Q’s identity, authenticity, purpose, objective has to maintain this plausible deniability along with everything Q says and does.\\nWe the people of the United States Of America are sheep. We have been fooled and misled very easily by the cabal.  Some people are unruly sheep but still sheep. They like to say they are awoke.  They still graze next to me in the same pasture.  They are sheep.\\nThey just sense the secretiveness of Q maintaining the plausible deniability.  Let’s examine the overall situation from way far away for a moment.  We should seek to understand others before discounting their voice.\\nYes, there are clues, hints, tongue in cheek posts, indicators but in the end plausible deniability is maintained.   We see code, double meaning words, even disinformation from Q, Q says this is necessary. Why? Maintain plausible deniability.\\nBut we didn’t as a society we trusted and blindly followed.   This is how we got to where we are today!  \\n\\n  Enter Trump and Qanon.  I use Qanon because Q has to remain anonymous.  Why?  1. Protect Trump. 2. Protect themselves and the administration from the repercussions.\\nQ must maintain this plausible deniability at all times.  If that is ever given up by accident or on purpose Trump and the administration could be in big trouble.\\nYes certain people didn’t do it blindly but yet followed. They were unruly sheep.  The true non-sheep are dead. They get killed because they are a danger to the herd and the Shepard.  Again unruly sheep.  If we had questioned and challenged along the way maybe different outcome.\\nOnly pride and ego stands in the way of them realizing they are sheep also.  Btw.

I hope to state the facts and give everyone situational awareness in this thread.\\nThis plausible deniability is what turns away certain folks.  They are usually the unruly sheep mentioned above.  They will challenge the authenticity of Q and so on.   This will happen when you have plausible deniability involved.  It doesn’t mean they are right or wrong.\\nQ remaining anonymous gives everyone plausible deniability.   I included 2 screenshots of a good definition even if it’s wiki. https://t.co/s5R0CRq064\\nLest we repeat the last 200 plus years.\\nOnce you realize this dichotomy then you can start to see others point of view.  \\n\\n  I’m not suggesting anyone start or stop following Q. Im not suggesting Q is fake , real,bad or a psyop.\\nIf anything can be taken from this thread let it be always question and challenge everything even if it’s in private or with a pal.  Discuss things throw around ideas.  Make any decision with eyes wide open and fully informed of all possibilities.\\nI have said from the beginning this is a personal journey of discovery.   If you just discovered someone else’s point of view that’s crazy awesome!!  It doesn’t mean you should switch views or positions it means you are a little more awake than before.\\nWe are sheep and we blindly followed the cabal till now this is fact. \\n\\nQ says we are sheep and is trying to teach us how to not follow blindly but requests us to trust the plan and follow blindly (plausible deniability).',\n",

Medics under that certification level have the same scope of practice as an RN.\\n5) The scope of practice issue requires ambulance services to hire more expensive nurses to do Critical Care work.\\n\\nI was one of 2 paramedics in the pilot program that sought to expand the scope of practice for paramedics in Washington state.\\n3) Larry is correct. Trump can't unilaterally decide to take funding for a B-2 bomber and use it to build the wall. That would be illegal.\\n\\nBut there is a way to get the job done.

       " \"Attractive people tend to have more self-confidence, which adds to the value of conversations. Those in good shape often add more energy to conversations, which attracts others to them.And attractive people are just nice to look at, even if both people are same-sex &amp; heterosexual\\nWhile one can be born with attractive features, being in shape and attractive generally shows that you take care of yourself. This means people take your opinions more seriously. And naturally, women may want you just for being sexually attractive.\\nGreat charisma and conversational skills make people feel good around you. Human relationships are emotional as well as transactional. \\n\\nRemember: people never remember everything you've said to them, but they *always* remember how you make them feel!\\n3) Be Sexually Attractive\\n\\nThis means being charismatic, in shape, interesting and well dressed.\\n\\nTrigger warning to SJWS: People like being around attractive people. If you take care of yourself, it says great things about you biologically and evolutionarily.\\n6) Be in a Position of Power Over Somebody\\n\\nThe more status you achieve in a field, or in life in general, the more people will come to you. Acknowledge this for what it is and understand how you can leverage your power to get favors from them.\\n2) Contribute to Someone's Interests\\n\\nVery similar to point #1. If you can contribute to an interest of someone else's, they will find you valuable. This is especially true if you are much more knowledgeable about it than they are.\\nHow to Add Value to People (thread)\\n\\nWhether you like it or not, human relationships are based on value. If you find that high-value people are not interested in relationships with you, it's because you haven't built your value up enough. Here are several tips on how to do this.\\n4) Have Something Somebody Wants\\n\\nThis can be money, influence, knowledge, status, supplies, or anything else. If you have something that the other person wants, you are instantly valuable to them. Just be aware of those who are deceptive at trying to get this out of you.\\n5) Connect With People Conversationally\\n\\nSocial skills are *extremely* valuable. All else being the same, someone with charisma has much more value than someone without it. And if you have a wide array of interests (point #1), you can easily connect with people.\\n8) Know How to Market, Teach, and Sell\\n\\nIt's not usually enough just to be valuable. It's essential to know how to express your value. If you can put yourself out there on the internet, through networking, etc, and sell yourself properly, you will have many choices in life.\\n7) Be an Expert at Something Valuable\\n\\nGranted, this takes a long time. But the more in-demand your knowledge and skills are, the more people need you. The more people need you, the more they can't afford to lose you. This can be an *extremely* powerful dynamic in your favor.\\n1) Be Well Balanced and Interesting\\n\\nHaving a diverse set of interests makes you interesting. It makes it easier to connect with people in conversation, which builds value. It also means you have a higher chance of knowing something that the other person doesn't.\\nAdditionally, if you know how to teach well, you can spread your knowledge and wisdom to others. This by itself is extremely valuable and will make you a magnet for those who want to know more about your skills and expertise.\\nI will be @ ing many of you over the next month or so to get more of my ideas out there.

Voters aren\\'t mind readers, @buzzbrockway. You may have great intentions, but voters can\\'t see your intentions. They can see only your policies.\\n8/ Politicians like @buzzbrockway  claim to hate \"conspiracy theories.\" What they fail to understand is how their own conduct in defending and/or implementing an insecure &amp; centralized  system within their OWN exclusive control directly leads to legitimate  concerns &amp; even alarm.\\n3/ The current statute, 21-2-50 (15) says that the SOS \"shall perform all the duties  imposed by this chapter,\" including \"To develop, program, build, &amp; review ballots for use by counties and  municipalities on direct recording electronic (DRE) voting systems in use in the state\" https://t.co/1by9GCzjS7\\n@IndivisibleTeam @IndivisibleGA13 @IndivisibleGA04 @IndivisibleGA06 @IndivisibleGA5 @IndivisibleGa10 @Indivisible_GA @IndivisibleGA03 @GA14Indivisible @IndivisibleGA11 @IndivisibleGA7 @atlveterans @IndivisibleGA06\\n13.

But he supports it &amp; has dismissed concerns about it as illegitimate \"conspiracy theories.\" He wants to be SOS.\\n7/ But creating another centralized Election Center--this time within the office of Secretary of State, which is unfortunately often tainted by strong partisanship--is hardly the answer to quell the legitimate concerns of many Georgia voters.\\n5/ In other words, #SB403 wld stick Georgia w/ ANOTHER centralized election system. Remember how well that worked out in the run up 2 the GA06 election w/ the massive breach of the centralized election management system at GA\\'s centralized Election Center? https://t.co/F6ZeNkGz3D\\n10/ So if you want to avoid what you refer to as \"conspiracy theories, \" you should enact policies that don\\'t require voters to have \"blind faith\" in members of the opposite party with respect to their votes.

       " 'It was an incredibly difficult time, a lesson in attempting to separate my feelings and my obligation as a member of the jury to do the thing right.\\n\\nIt was nothing compared to what she went through. Nothing.\\nI do not think he was innocent. I still don\\'t think he was innocent. \\n\\nThat\\'s why Not Guilty doesn\\'t always mean innocent.\\n\\nThat\\'s why \"beyond reasonable doubt\" means that women sometimes go through all this, and end up without a conviction, but can still be telling the truth.\\nI believe that the DPP, at the time of sentencing, indicated they would try to prosecute again for the rape charges (as he was found guilty on some sexual assault charges related).\\n\\nI shudder to think of that woman, having to do it all over again.\\nWith everything that we saw and heard, with everything that this man showed us about his character, I can\\'t believe that she would, for any reason, have taken this action frivolously.\\nAnd just because a lawyer somewhere managed to introduce some reasonable doubt does not mean that a defendant is innocent. It merely means that \"beyond reasonable doubt\" couldn\\'t be fulfilled.\\n\\nThis does not mean a thing didn\\'t happen.\\nThe jury couldn\\'t reach a verdict on the rape charges. I sometimes wonder how that might have been different if I had been in the room.\\nBeing on a jury for a rape trial, I saw first hand how difficult it was for the victim to recount her experiences. It was difficult to hear, difficult to watch some pieces of video evidence, etc. But I was aware that my discomfort was nothing to what she experienced.\\nThis is how, sometimes, you can end up feeling like you are obliged to vote for Not Guilty, even if you personally feel like the defendant is actually guilty, because of issues with evidence and reasonable doubt.\\nI asked myself this more than once. In the several weeks I spent on that jury, I never could come up with a single satisfactory reason why she would have gone to court, subjected herself to this, had her life picked through with a fine tooth comb, other than that he did it.\\nI don\\'t know if this is what happened in that jury room. Only the jury themselves know that.\\n\\nBut I also want to particularly highlight that it\\'s not a verdict of \"innocent\". \\n\\nInnocent is not the opposite of guilty in the context of the courtroom.\\nIn many cases, balance of probabilities is good enough - i.e. if it seems more likely that scenario A happened than scenario B, you can return in favour of scenario A. \\n\\nThis is not the case for serious crimes, such as rape and sexual assault.\\nThese cases must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, which means that if a lawyer can introduce some reasonable doubt, you are instructed to afford the benefit of this doubt to the accused.\\nSeeing a lot of \"they\\'re innocent til proven guilty\" and \"this means they are innocent\" tweets about #Belfast today, so I thought I\\'d share what it was like being on a jury for rape and sexual assault.\\nIn the trial I sat on, I had to be recused right before deliberations due to travel, and the trial running longer than scheduled (I had warned the judge in advance, but was sworn in anyway). I did find out the result though, in the media, some months later.\\nHe seemed controlling, abusive, manipulative. He lied, deleted texts, likely drugged her, etc. I firmly believe he did these things. \\n\\nBut that tricky \"reasonable doubt\" provision means that it\\'s not really about what I felt or believed, it\\'s about the evidence and the case.\\nI was the foreperson on a trial a short time ago, for a rape and sexual assault that happened approx. 2 years prior to the trial. As part of the process, the burden of proof was explained in detail to the jury members, as was our duty in relation to this.\\nAnd I often think to myself about my feelings during that case. About how I felt quite sure that the defendant had done the things he was accused of, but that I knew I would have had to return Not Guilty for at least one of the rape charges because of the reasonable doubt.\\nAnd as ever, I can\\'t help but loop right back to \"why would she put herself through this frivolously\".\\n\\nShe had nothing to gain here. They spent days tearing her apart on the stand. Tearing apart everything she said, did, etc. What for, if not because she needed justice?\\nI watched her break down on the stand. I watched the emotion pour out of her. I watched her hide her face as we were shown videos and photos.',\n",

       " '9/ I recommend that you read any attempt to paint McCabe as the villain here, and agents in New York as conscientious, as a preemptive strike against what the IG is likely to have found—which is the opposite. Comey was convinced the problem was not McCabe but the New York office.\\n3/ While agents in \"Trumplandia\"—what the NYC field office of the FBI was called due to its militant pro-Trump faction—sat on evidence they were supposed to be analyzing, they were leaking information to Rudy Giuliani to help Trump\\'s team initiate a pressure campaign on Comey.\\nBREAKING NEWS at The Washington Post is the story I wrote over a year ago about the FBI sitting on Comey\\'s request to review the Clinton emails on Weiner\\'s PC. It took a year, but I promised everyone this would eventually hit the mainstream—and now it has. https://t.co/U2kkPpeVuA\\nPS/ @DevlinBarrett/@washingtonpost will regret writing this story the way they did. McCabe—per Comey—was a victim, like Comey, of rogue pro-Trump agents in the NYC office who were, per Giuliani and Prince, carefully coordinating their leaks and do-nothingism with Trump\\'s people.\\n6/ By the way, FOIA-retrieved emails between McCabe and Comey confirm that while McCabe was amping up Comey\\'s fear of leaks, he looks to have been doing so out of concern rather than as part of a plot. The bad actors here are rogue pro-Trump agents (Giuliani pals) in the NYC FBI.\\nPS4/ The question Trump appointee Chris Wray will shortly have to answer is why he bought Trump agent Devin Nunes\\' gloss on all this—that McCabe was dragging his feet on checking the \"new\" Clinton emails—when that literally would be *against his interests* if he were pro-Clinton.\\nPS2/ IG Horowitz will soon ask—or has already—why McCabe emailed the True Pundit Hoax to Comey warning him of false leaks about the \"new\" Clinton emails and their content if he *didn\\'t* want to clear up the issue. I\\'m telling you, the facts will show McCabe wasn\\'t a bad guy here.\\n2/ Long story short: I showed in four late 2016/early 2017 articles in The Huffington Post that the NYC field office of the FBI deliberately ignored Comey\\'s orders in the Clinton investigation in a way that forced him to \"re-open\" the Clinton probe, giving the election to Trump.\\nCONCLUSION/ Given all this, the narrative being set up by @DevlinBarrett and @washingtonpost contradicts every piece of information we have about what the NYC field office of the FBI was/wasn\\'t doing in October \\'16. They should check their sources for bias/self-interest and stat.\\n7/ Remember, Comey said under oath—at a hearing Trump watched, and during which Trump decided to fire him—that he was actively and aggressively trying to find out which rogue pro-Trump FBI agents leaked to Giuliani. \\n\\nI\\'ve always believed he was partly fired because of *that*.\\n10/ Likewise, any claim the FBI sat on these emails to aid Clinton has it hilariously backward—throughout October, FBI agents in the NYC office (and NYPD) were leaking to Giuliani and Prince so they could *weaponize* these emails under the pretext they were new and incriminating.\\n4/ I\\'ve long thought the Inspector General\\'s report—and Horowitz generally—could be a possible \"second savior\" (after Mueller) in the Trump-Russia probe, as I think he has evidence to suggest the FBI in NYC was, in a coordinated/illegal way, trying to help Trump win the election.\\nPS5/ The early indications were the \"new\" emails were duplicates, which didn\\'t suit the pro-Trump FBI agents in NYC—it\\'s why they leaked lies to Giuliani, Prince and True Pundit re: what the new emails said. But McCabe would\\'ve known in early October they were likely duplicates.\\n12/ I\\'m going through old tweets and finding at least one tweet begging media to cover the \"Trumplandia\" conspiracy every month. I can\\'t wait until the IG finally releases his report—it\\'s going to go beyond Trump-Russia coordination to look *directly* at how the election was won.\\n5/ Here\\'s my article—from over a year ago—on today\\'s \"breaking\" WaPo news. \\n\\nThe article incorporates via link (see third paragraph) three lengthy articles on the same subject that preceded it. \\n\\n(Long-time readers, you\\'re already caught up on this story.) https://t.co/P1WEKXERQx\\nPS3/ Here\\'s your chief clue on all this: Comey\\'s Twitter feed makes *crystal clear* that Comey believes McCabe is *innocent of any wrongdoing*. So the chance the IG will find McCabe was working against Comey—rather than agents we know were leaking to Giuliani—is basically *zero*.\\n8/ The Inspector General\\'s report could be the turning of the tide Trump critics have waited for, as it should show what I\\'ve long said—there\\'s proof (audio, video, tweets, emails) Flynn, Bannon, Prince, Giuliani and Don Jr. plotted to coerce Comey into re-opening Clinton\\'s case.\\n11/ In Summer 2017, it looked like the \"True Pundit Hoax\" story (also known as the #Trumplandia conspiracy) was going to be picked up, but for unknown reasons U.S. media backed off. https://t.co/t8XCW1ngwY',\n",

All of us together. \\n\\nWe shall be holy, for God is holy.\\nAnd Moses—fresh from his new! Improved! More egalitarian! Leadership!—does great violence to that. And traditional commentators, like so many people today, ignore, minimize, explain away this violence in service to the leadership, the structures. The organization’s reputation.\\nAnd then *record scratch* he keeps talking. \\n\\n“Don’t go near a woman.”   \\n\\nGod didn’t say that. \\n\\nSuddenly, Moses is only addressing men. Women have gone from being subjects—part of the people—to objects. Who are sexual temptations who must be avoided. https://t.co/Va4uCaIjWi\\nOk, y’all. Would you like some #metoo Torah? \\n\\nThread.\\n\\nThe Torah portion we read this coming Shabbat starts with the story of Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law, giving him some tips about refining his leadership model, delegating, becoming more effective in his leadership.\\nThen, fast-forward. The people Israel are hanging out at the base of Mt. Sinai, while God gives instructions to Moses. This translation is misleading; there’s no “warning” and no “staying pure.” God tells Moses to קדש the people—to make them holy, sanctified, set-apart. https://t.co/H4nML4ktdc\\nOK, @LilithMagazine turned it into an essay, for those who want it like this: https://t.co/Ack4POmjeV\\nYou can’t make this stuff up.\\nIn one sentence, Moses simultaneously cuts women out of Revelation and turns them into sexual objects. \\n\\nWomen aren’t the ones being told to prepare for Torah, here, after all. They’re just a problem.\\nAs it happens, we see קדש come up, most notably in the Holiness Code, the metaphoric and literal heart of the Torah (chiastic structure, yo). Explicitly not about ritual purity. Rather: https://t.co/TP4vuPPxdi\\nTraditional commentators make sense of all this by suggesting that קדש is a command for Israel to attain a state of ritual elevation/purity, akin to where they must be to offer sacrifices in the Temple. Since seminal ejaculation would imperil that status, that’s what God meant.\\nOnly problem is that קדש is not that state. We have a word for that. טהר. \\n\\nMoses dumped his human stuff into his command from God. His ideas about gender and power and hierarchy and who matters and sex and whatever else. He twisted a command from the Holy One to suit his agenda.\\nAlso people correctly noted that I was alluding to Judith Plaskow’s Jewish feminist theological masterwork, Standing Again At Sinai. It’s not an accident, that title. Go read the book if you haven’t.\\nThis makes it clearer even still that when God asked Moses to קדש the community, to make-holy them, it was about the whole community, in its fullness, safety, created-in-the-Divine-image-ness. \\n\\nFor I your God am holy.\\nAnd the commentators who could have pounced on the discrepancy (they’re very good at that) instead did the same thing. They saw something fishy but it suited their ideas about gender and power so they explained it away. Excused it. Rationalized it and ignored its impact on women.\\nHey, for everyone asking for the mom-friendly version of this (until I turn it into an essay), here: https://t.co/6pCvXKtpzq\\nAnd hey, here’s Merle Feld’s classic poem, “We All Stood Together.” This too. https://t.co/ETrAO7Gubx\\nIt’s clear from the verb that Moses needs to do a thing to them. So then Moses goes back, and he does it! He קדש them. Sanctifies, makes holy, sets apart, something. It’s still not clear what the action is, but he does it. Plus the clothes washing thing. There’s no warning. https://t.co/2RdIuyrhiX\\n(You guys got the part where the bad translation of קדש in the @SefariaProject translation is totally informed by this traditional commentators’ misreading of the situation, right?

What America is seeing now is a run-of-the-mill criminal conspiracy to intimidate, punish, and discredit key witnesses in a federal investigation into High Crimes that could impeach a president and—perhaps, eventually—convict him.\\n6/ People forget that Rod Rosenstein is a key witness in the Obstruction case against Trump—just as McCabe is.

       " 'I want you to imagine that man, sitting in a chair in the basement of his son\\'s house some forty years after, staring off into space as he told his grandson about watching people die from starvation and dysentery. About trying to feed people and killing them.\\nHe told me that it was real. That it was death industrialized. That it was carried out right up until the end. That we... the USA... did nothing to stop it, when we could have. That people like him had even supported turning boatloads of Jews away in the 30\\'s.\\nBefore WWII my grandather was a recent medical school grad who wanted to be a plastic surgeon. He was the son of an Italian immigrant who\\'d managed to get through school on his own dime, married a model (my grandmother was in Vogue, I\\'m told) and was all set to have a great life\\nHe came home and had kids (my father was the oldest, born in 1948) and never recovered from what he\\'d seen. He went into plastic surgery and was quite successful. He didn\\'t love his wife anymore, or the children he had with her, or really anyone or anything. Nothing mattered.\\nI remember as much of it as I can for him because he\\'s gone now. \\n\\nThe Holocaust was real. He saw it. He told me. We can\\'t ever forget.\\nHe ended up a doctor in the Army. He actually volunteered. Was so mad about the sneak attack. Thought he\\'d end up in the Pacific, but that\\'s not how things went. Served in North Africa, then Italy, before D-Day. (He spoke Italian and German so he was valuable.)\\nFor my grandfather, that moment was the whole war. The utter failure of his world to save those people. He was a doctor and he couldn\\'t save them. He came face to face with the industrialization of genocide and he simply broke, and remained broken for decades.\\nThese are the things that old man told me. While telling me about trying to feed a small Jewish girl and coming back to find her dead anyway. The smell of bodies and waste. \"So thick in the air I could see it.\" That\\'s the crop you grow when you sow these dragon\\'s teeth. Dead kids\\nHe didn\\'t come home and put it aside, because he couldn\\'t. I remember being a child sitting in the basement with him while he shook and wept and told me these things that I was far too young to understand. Because somebody had to know, and his own son hated him.\\nIt was genocide against Jews, the Roma, homosexuals and it was waged in stages. Bergen-Belsen didn\\'t spring up from the ground like sown dragon\\'s teeth. They started with restrictive laws, rhetoric, and grew. The oxygen that fueled that flame was the blind eyes the world turned.\\nHe was somewhat isolationist, from what he\\'d told me. Didn\\'t care about Europe or her problems, certainly didn\\'t care much about Jews. Typical stereotypes, saw them as greedy and money hungry. Didn\\'t want to go over and fight. Then Pearl Harbor happened.\\n\"I deserve it.\"\\n\\nHe had brown eyes. I remember them, the way they looked.\\n\\n\"I should have left them years ago.\"\\n\\nThe Holocaust was a real thing. Never let anyone tell you different, or try and reframe it as anything other than genocide.\\nThe idea that people will try and tell you it wasn\\'t real drove him insane. The idea that it could happen again here, that anyone could parrot the mad ideals that led to it, that his own relatives in Italy, his cousins had fought for fascism... he lived his life broken by it.\\nWhat mattered to him was what happened after they\\'d pushed the Germans far enough back. \\n\\nSee, my grandfather was one of the first Americans to see a concentration camp. As a doctor, he was one of the first ones to treat the survivors. And it broke him.\\nOkay, since we\\'re remembering the Holocaust, I\\'m going to tell a story about my grandfather. He was, by and large, a strange man who treated his children and wife poorly. And the reasons were complicated, and rooted in his time in the Army.\\nOf course he saw a lot of shit. Told me about watching men die on D-Day, being unable to do anything for them. Told me about the slow, inexorable march through Europe, the push to defeat the Germans. Told it in a very clinical way, because it barely mattered to him.',\n",

       " 'To the Kikuyu home base then, Jomo and his cronies made their political problem an existential one for an entire people, and reached out to the most potent tool the Mau Mau had ever deployed, the oath of unity.\\nJomo and his men kept the laws intact in case the natives ever got restless again. \\n\\nHis son must be grateful to have such a worthy inheritance (and men willing to break laws on his behalf). https://t.co/i36SyEzqZy\\nTo understand just how far back into the colonial model we have sunk, check the dates on the sections on oaths GOK is using. They were all passed after 1950, and seem to have been modified as our colonizers learnt more about the oathing process. \\nhttps://t.co/Pj8bRcyFsj\\nThe exhaustive colonial laws against those who take them (even under threat), those who administer them, and those who are merely present tells you just how much the government feared the symbolism and uniting power of the oath.\\nEnd of particular thread. \\n\\nLong Live the Prince!\\nThat Uhuru\\'s inherited support base,  descendants of a brave generation for whom this law was designed to subjugate, are defending its use just six and a half decades later tells you  how power dynamics shifted. There\\'s a new slave class, a native people to be subjugated.\\nThe sad thing it is even in our attitude to press freedom. What, pray tell, constitutes a \\'responsible media?\\' Is it one that deliberately censors itself from covering an event attended by tens of thousands, and with symbolic meaning to half the electorate?\\nThe use of the ritual ideology (of a binding oath) by the Mau Mau was demonized by colonial psy-ops and later, by the clergy in \\'69. There\\'s proof, in D. Ndegwa\\'s memoirs, that Jomo knew about the oathing (it was happening in his compound anyway) despite denials.\\nAmong the first things Jomo and his men did is to isolate the Luo by isolating KPU\\'s non-Luo support such as Bildad Kaggia and Joseph Mwasia Nthula. The opposition to the wily old man, as his son has clearly learnt, then just became one people, apparently led by one man.\\nOathing didn\\'t stop simply because these laws were in place and people suffered for them. It didn\\'t stop even after Louis Leakey tried to design a counter-intuitive, hoping to break the \\'demonic\\' and \\'barbaric\\' hold it had on those who had taken it.\\nIf you think about it, our postcolonial attitude to irredentism, of which the Somali secession and \\'tribal clashes\\' have been a huge part, have been answered with measures ripped right out of the colonial playbook.\\nThe downtrodden of the 1950s, who had lost even more people, more land, and liberties, were recruited into the villainy of the \\'60s and \\'70s (and oathing laws conveniently forgotten, while detention without trial ones were updated).\\nTheir survival after 1963 wasn\\'t accidental. Jomo retained the colonial attitude to peasant revolutions, except of course if it was 1969 and busloads were being forced to take the oath in his name.\\nThe law Miguna Miguna has been charged under was passed to fight, not surprisingly, the peasant irredentism known as the Mau Mau.\\n\\nIt was passed in 1955 but other laws had already been used to charge people with \\'administering an illegal oath\\' in the years before. \\n\\nA thread. https://t.co/e4goQmh4W1\\nThat such a colonial law survives to this day, and is being used in the way it is, tells you alot about the thinking of the elite who took over this country and have ruled ever since. \\n\\n\"Any oaths for us is fine, anything else and you are not above this very old law.\"\\nPerhaps it\\'s important to see why oathing resurfaced among the Kikuyu in 1969. Kenya was a \\'free country\\' by then, but Odinga and Kenyatta had fallen out on land and social justice in 1966.\\n\\nBy \\'69, there was a new enemy to fight (the Luo), and now Mboya and Kodhek were dead.\\nOf all the tools the Mau Mau had in their arsenal, the oaths (three main levels) was the most potent. In all Mau Mau memoirs it symbolises rebirth and freedom. It was a moment, as \\'69 showed as well, when a people could be bound to a single cause.\\nEven our laws on hate speech and incitement don\\'t make much sense. In a cyclical way, they are meant to maintain the slave-master patronage system we\\'ve built since 1895,  deliberately keeping majority of Kenyans as natives/peasants in need of discipline and convenient truth.',\n",
       " 'And there\\'s one now. Cool.\\nFor the 2/10, keep in mind that there are a LOT of \"Dear Sirs\" and \"I have published the next bestseller please take it on or else here\\'s my number\" queries. At time of tweeting, I have 6 \"Dear Sir/Madam,\" 2 \"Next bestseller,\" and 1 \"Next JK Rowling\" queries waiting. So.\\nSo, that\\'s where I\\'m at. Do I still expect lots of \"Agents are so mean because they don\\'t give feedback\" emails? Yes. And the check-ins at three weeks? And the \"I am so tired of agents being SO UNPROFESSIONAL and NOT GIVING ANY FEEDBACK\" tweets? Yes.\\nKeep in mind that I don\\'t get all day to read submissions. I actually spend more time on clients, meetings, my own submissions, contracts, and the like. I\\'m pretty much reading during downtime--evenings, weekends, subway, train trips, plane trips, waiting in line.\\nWith a 7.5% request rate (2.99/day times 5 (M-F) times 4 (weeks in month) = 59.97 manuscripts. If I read 20 pages each on average (keep in mind many are picture books), that\\'s 1,199.4 pages of requested material/month + 6,474 unrequested = 7,673.4 pages a month of submissions.\\nSo, yes, we are busy. No, we are not sitting here cackling like \"Haha, I know exactly how to fix her manuscript, and I\\'m not telling her! Why? Because! Bwahahahaa!\" Much as I receive a lot of correspondence to this effect.\\nAnd I get genuine energy and pleasure out of connecting people. I think all agents do. Makes me feel like what I do is meaningful. And that means so much more than numbers could.\\nDo I suspect some agents just manage to be faster through...magic? Better systems? Better coffee? Not sleeping? Working harder? Being better at life? Yes. Definitely. This is just where I\\'m at, now. Catch me in a few years, and things may be very different.\\nThings I could do to be faster (of course I\\'ve considered them!): 1) Not respond to queries. This would save about 30 seconds from each, times 39.98 times 5 (M-F) times 4 (weeks) divided by 60 (convert to minutes) = 399.8 minutes a month, or 6.6633 hours.\\nI suspect a lot of agents have similar inboxes (I\\'ve heard everywhere from 10-50 average queries a day). Many probably have lower request rates (perhaps closer to 1-2%). Many have assistants, interns, teams. However, I suspect that 0% of agents enjoy making writers wait.\\n4) Drink more coffee, sleep less. I\\'m up to two coffees a day, one tea. Just tried the Starbucks app for the first time today (it was weird--too easy). I think that\\'s enough. Otherwise I\\'ll just run around all day. And bad things happen fast if I don\\'t sleep.\\nYou may be asking, \"Jessica! Why in the world are you doing side projects when you have all of this happening?\" The answer is that, for me, it\\'s easier to keep moving. A change, for me, even if just a setting (office vs coworking space vs home) is more restorative than a rest.\\n2) Let readers make all of the query requesting decisions for me. Now, if you know me at all, you know I am waaaaayyyyyy too much of a control freak to let that happen. I read all queries myself. 3) Manuscripts--same.\\nNow, I strongly suspect the 7.5 percent is high (this was calculated maybe two years ago?). But even say it\\'s 3 percent now, that\\'s 1.1994 requests a day, times 5 (M-F), times 4 (weeks) times 20 (average pages read) = 479.76 requested pages read/month.\\nSo we get (I did the math awhile ago) an average of 39.98 queries a workday times 5 days = 2,158 pages/month from queries. I probably read an average of 2/10 of the included pages, so that\\'s 1 query + 2 pages times 2,158 = 6,474 pages/month.\\nDo I try to keep up? Yes! Do I achieve inbox zero? No! Inbox 100? No. Do I try to keep in touch about delays? Yes! Do I always manage to check in with everyone when things take a long time? Sadly, no. Am I constantly feeling guilt about making so many people wait? Yes. Yes, I am.\\nSo it\\'s very common for writers to ask why agents don\\'t give feedback. The answer, usually, is that we\\'re busy--but that\\'s hard to grasp on a concrete level. Today, the lovely and talented @BenFaulknerEd mentioned reading tons, and out of curiosity, I did the math to compare.\\n5) Give Up Everything Fun And Just Be An Efficient Human, Dammit: Believe me, I\\'ve tried. Strangely, this makes me miserable and worse at my job. I do need some degree of happiness in my life to be able to function as a creative person--which an agent is. Always. So. That\\'s out.',\n",

       " '1) Thread start: I came across Obama’s executive order 13762 this evening and it absolutely blew me away. \\nThe following thread is a mix of hard fact and\\npersonal theory. Please read with a skeptical mind, but I encourage you, if\\nnothing else, to look into this executive order.\\n2) Sally Yates and James Comey signed off on a FISA renewal for Carter Page on 1/19/17. Since this technically did not happen on Trump’s watch, he got Comey to do it again under his administration in order to take away Comey’s ability to say he had simply been following orders.\\n6) The obvious guess is Obama new something about Dana Boente that made him want to keep Boente a million miles away from Trump if and when he fired Yates.  I believe this was an incredible miscalculation on Obama’s part as it obviously drew Trump’s interest to Mr. Boente.\\n7) I believe Dana Boente then played a part to gain Comey’s confidence so that Comey would sign another FISA renewal using the fake dossier and perhaps, other spurious evidence. Boente and Comey co-signed a FISA renewal on 4/19/17, after\\nSessions but before Rosentein confirmed.\\n12) Oh, and where is Dana Boente now, you ask? On January 23, 2018 Christopher Wray appointed him as general counsel to the FBI.  James Baker’s replacement. Sounds like a reward, doesn’t it? I think it probably was.\\nAddendum: I put this together quickly and threading is not my thing normally. \\n\\nMy main objective is to get people to look at the executive order and ask a) why the change was made, and b) why Trump appointed the exact person that was taken out of the line of succession by Obama.\\n16) End Thread: Thanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts.\\n5) If you are a multitasker, open tabs for “Executive order 13762”, “Dana Boente”, and “Sally Yates” and alt-tab between them to make connections.\\nLink to EO 13762 \\nNote 1: You might have to copy and paste this link URL into a browser.\\nNote 2: Removal of U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia is not explicitly stated. Rather, the position is simply removed from the succession order.\\nhttps://t.co/VrgOrbWoU1\\n9) James Comey was fired on May 10, 2017. Robert Mueller was appointed on May 17, 2017. It is important to note that this was one day after Trump met with Mueller to, as far as anyone knows, discuss serving again as the Director of the FBI.\\n15) Note: Here are the dates and signatories for the four FISA warrants\\n(disclaimer: I have deduced the signers based on available information. Believe to be accurate).\\n\\n10/21/16: Comey/Yates \\n01/19/17: Comey/Yates\\n04/19/17: Comey/Boente \\n07/18/17: McCabe/Rosenstein\\n8) Boente was Acting Deputy Attorney General when the FISA warrant was renewed.\\n4) In executive order 13762, Obama SPECIFICALLY\\nREMOVES the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virgina (Dana\\nBoente) from the succession list to Attorney General.  Read that again, then go check it out for yourself.\\n14) On 7/18/17, Rosenstein and McCabe signed the 3rd and final extension (one original, three extensions were signed). I can think of several theories as to the investigative target of this final renewal. McCabe and FISA judges come to mind as the obvious ones, but time will tell\\n10) And what about Rosentein? We won’t know until we know, of course, but I find it interesting that Rosenstein both advised Trump to fire Comey, and immediately hired Robert Mueller.\\n11) This made him look like an Alt-Deputy Attorney General.  Meanwhile, Sessions is playing the part of ineffectual Attorney General. This is all a smokescreen.\\n13) The rest of the FISA story will need to come together, but I think it is highly plausible that the 4/19/17 FISA renewal is what triggered both Comey’s firing and the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel.  Comey, of course was told he was fired for other reasons.\\n3) Trump fires Yates on 1/30/17 and appoints United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Dana Boente as acting Attorney General.  Now, let’s back up a\\nminute and talk about executive order 13762, issued by Obama on January 13,\\n2017.  \\n\\nThis is a bombshell IMO.',\n",
       " \"And here: https://t.co/iIXQbMOUOH\\n@JoshuaRozenberg @guardian\\nAnother version of my argument can be found here: https://t.co/9G2HJFli0X\\nFor my reasoning on this see my blog on the WGAD decision: https://t.co/EoTUQQNe8g\\nFourthly, the fact that Assange is deliberately resisting arrest doesn’t resolve this issue, as this would be to argue that liberty is a right contingent on his co-operation.\\nI strongly disagree with the Chief Magistrate's account of the WGAD decision in her judgment released today on Assange's arrest warrant. https://t.co/gYbnDFiPeB\\nHaving said all this, the grounds for determining whether a deprivation of liberty is arbitrary is a separate question.  This rests, inter alia, on considerations of proportionality.  This is where the WGAD could have been clearer.\\nThirdly, liberty must be capable of being realized in practice. Where exercising liberty has considerable coercive results, this constitutes a restriction of liberty in actuality. Assange can hardly be said to be voluntarily ‘self-confined’.\\nIn sum: as counterintuitive as it may seem, liberty deprivation doesn’t consist only in the easily recognizable conditions of state detention.\\nThis is the link to the ruling today - I posted the link in my original tweet to the 6 February ruling ...  https://t.co/eIGzjMDpeK apologies...\\nThe reasoning is that Assange is free to leave the embassy when he wishes, he is free to receive visitors, choose the food he eats, sleeps and exercises, can sit on the balcony, and is not locked in at night, use his computer, mobile phone unlike a prisoner....\\nThis comparison with Wandsworth prison, or any prison, and her belief that Assange is free to leave, leads her to the view that Assange isn't deprived of his liberty.\\n@suigenerisjen @MadsAndenas\\nFifth, liberty is not a privilege gained for good behavior, it is a right which demands justifications from those seeking its restriction.\\nI disagree with this line of reasoning. First, the line between a ‘restriction of liberty’ and ‘deprivation of liberty’ is finely drawn in European human rights jurisprudence ‘as a matter of degree or intensity, but not one of nature or substance’ (Guzzardi).\\nIn para 36 of the judgment the Chief Magistrate rejects the idea that living in the Ecuadorian Embassy for six years is simply a case of self-confinement, hence a restriction of liberty rather than a deprivation of liberty.\",\n",

So don’t worry about us: look in the mirror and worry about him. 18/18\\nOur hearts are scarred because the official Leave campaign led by you offered a confection of unfulfillable promises that any realistic appraisal would show to be unachievable.  2/18\\nTime is running out, and all too soon you will have to stop your dance of the seven veils and stand naked before the People and before history. And they will judge you as we have already judged you:  17/18\\n(which is ironic, in view of Leave’s constant championing of Parliamentary sovereignty). You have cast doubt on the impartiality of the civil service. And you have sought to undermine the independence of the judiciary. 14/18\\nOur hearts are scarred because you and your free marketeer cohorts managed to translate the result of an advisory referendum into a purported demand from the People for far more than they ever voted for: not just to leave the EU, but the Single Market and the Customs Union, 8/18\\nOur hearts are scarred because even with all the pie in the sky promises, Leave would not have achieved a majority if it hadn’t been aided by a xenophobic parallel campaign fronted by Nigel Farage.  5/18\\nIt is still impossible, and yet as the fog of bombastic rhetoric clears and the unsquareable circle becomes ever more discernible you and your fellow Brexiteers continue to promise the unachievable. 4/18\\nto turn our back on our closest, largest market and transform the UK into a low regulation low tax offshore paradise for capitalists, combining Indian levels of environmental regulation with the tax rules of the British Virgin Islands. 9/18\\nWe do not want to see our country asset-stripped for the enrichment of a small cabal of businessmen and politicians for their own personal gain.  10/18\\nYou may not have endorsed his demonisation of those who come to the UK from other countries, but you certainly reaped the benefit.

The EU citizens who have come here to work and make a life in the UK, who have helped sustain our health service and our social care, who have contributed to our communities and our economic wellbeing. 11/18\\nOur hearts are scarred because we are patriots, and because we believe that the referendum is being used by a small group to bring about an outcome which is utterly damaging to our country,  15/18\\nthe people who live in it, and the systems of law and government that have served as a model to the rest of the world for centuries.  And no bombast or empty promises from you will stop our hearts from being scarred.  16/18\\nThe campaign which helped you to your victory has brought needless division and unhappiness to many people. 7/18\\nBut you worked hard to denigrate anyone who offered such a realistic appraisal by dismissing it as Project Fear and sneering at ‘experts’. You even admitted that you were offering voters the prospect of having our cake and eating it: a byword for the impossible.  3/18\\nAnd our fellow British citizens who will suffer job losses, inflation and a diminished standard of living as a result of your desire to sacrifice our country on the altar of your ambition. 12/18\\nOur hearts are scarred because those who support Brexit have made every attempt to destroy the mechanisms that make our system of government great.

The impossibility of meaningful treaty reform. We cannot edit the supranationalist DNA of the EU\\n19. The way in which it gradually erases member states from international forums and global bodies, handing the power to a small unelected elite as we witness the privatisation of regulation.\\n9. The way in which corporates can capture the regulatory agenda and lobby without meaningful public scrutiny.\\n12. The fact that even if we had a pan-European demos with meaningful power blocs, the Parliament cannot dictate the Commission agenda.\\n14. The way in which it turns a blind eye to politically inconvenient breaches of its own rules while ruthlessly enforcing them in weaker member states.\\n4. A completely unelected High Representative pushing a foreign policy with zero mandate where there is no common position among member states.\\n15. The way in which it slowly erodes domestic powers to legislate our own labour markets and terms of employment.\\n5. The way in which political elites have their own narcissistic groupthink and impose policy with no regard to the unintended consequences.\\n2. The exclusion of the public from decisions relating to further integration. See Treaty of Lisbon.\\n11. The fact that it finances institutions of civil society to manufacture establishment loyalty and pays NGOs to lobby it for the pretence of legitimacy.\\n3. The way in which the EU will seek homogenisation and integration for its own sake and for that of EU ideology over practical necessity.\\n20. By my understanding of the word democracy - the people having the power to shape the rules they live by, I cannot see that the EU is anything approaching democratic.\\n10. The way in which its aggressive trade policies in Africa destroy fishing grounds, forces premature trade liberalisation and drives migration - leading to people smuggling and thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean.\\n7. The way in which the EU creates a platform for populists and the far right - and is largely responsible for its resurgence.\\n17. The fact that the EU's most vocal supporters have no idea what the EU is, are oblivious to its history, and use it as a veil of narcissistic righteousness irrespective of its blood soaked trade policy.\\n16. The way in which unions, NGOs and academia become compliant and emollient - then go native - forgetting their primary function.\\n13. The way in which it never takes responsibility for its failings, often in denial of the problems it creates.\\n8. The fact we have a supreme government for Europe and our leaders have no idea how it works or the depth of integration - or how we even got here.\\n18. The way in which trade progress is pegged to the slowest ship in the convoy, muting the potential of member states in pursuing their more relevant cultural relationships.\\n6. The way in which the European Parliament makes decisions for us despite the pitiful mandate and low turnouts.\",\n",
       " '2. It was was easily countered by wa of saying that those jobs depended on trade with the EU, not membership of a political union. So there was always the historic inference that we wanted the maximum trade cooperation possible.\\n9. Over the last few months we have witnessed a London leaver bubble evolving which relies on the ignorance and bovine conformity of those they attract to their cause. \"It\\'s no longer left vs right\" they tell us earnestly. \"It\\'s democrats vs antidemocrats\".\\n5. It is actually a relatively recent thing that only the hardest Brexit qualified as \"The One True Brexit\". It comes from a very small band of ultra \"free market\" Tories masquerading as liberals in the form of the IEA/TPA and all of the Tufton Street sock puppet organisations.\\n14. The Leave Alliance took the view that in order to safeguard jobs and trade we would need a model that preserves single market particpation but one with a firewall to end the ratchet of the EU. Our studies pointed to EEA not only as the best means but also the speediest exit.\\n16. In fact, the Tory taliban would have got nowhere without the manifest ignorance of leading leavers - many of whom still think the WTO option is viable. Even Kate Hoey, nominally a socialist, sent coppies if Liam Halligan\\'s ultra hard Brexit book to her collegues at Christmas.\\n20. As far as we are concerned the decision to leave is not all that controversial. The goals of the EU never enjoyed majority support and never will. We got the mandate to leave, but nowhere does it say the lunatic fringe of the Tories get to dictate everything after the fact.\\n13. Of course, we adults know that all trade agreements and every international accord is on some level the expenditure of sovereignty for economic gain. It\\'s a trade off and it always was. Undiluted sovereingty exists nowhere in the real world.\\n11. For sure there are still remainers in the public domain who will do anything to sabotage Brexit and we have sympathy with the view that they are antidemocratic, but to engineer it into a binary paradigm is the most dishonest trick tory leavers have pulled to date.\\n3. If asked if we would support a Brexit that would necessarily result in new barriers to trade, pretty much ecvery leaver would have said no. The infernence is that we would look to safeguard those three million jobs.\\n17. This is the Minford model - the one that bascally assumes that if we unilaterally liberalise on all trade barriers, demolishing agriculture and manufacturing and automotive sector, we can deregulate and London becomes Singapore on Thames.\\n1. Time for a #Brexit history lesson. Us old school leavers bumped into the remain canard that \"three million jobs\" depend on the EU time and again over many years. So well worn were the arguments that Remain scarcely dare deploy that line during the referendum.\\n10. This is of course, utter bollocks. There is a growing contingent of largely voiceless leavers who see merit in an EEA solution, but we are not useful to the narrative. Meanwhile there are MPs like Stephen Kinnock who\\'ve done their homeworks and seen the strategic value in it.\\n21. The short of it is that without the EEA there most definitely will be new barriers to trade and substantially reduced market particpation and there are no \"bumbper trade deals\" that will compensate. It\\'s time to call the Tory right out for what they are. Liars.\\n19. There is something inherenly evil about any sect, party or group who would seek to reduce any political dilemma to binary outcomes and dennouncing the other as a maleviolent force, but that is in effect what the Tory right have done. Quite successfully.\\n15. But by way of having a stranglehold over the narrative - largely thanks to a Londoncentric media, the Brexit ayatollahs have managed to conflate the EEA with EU membership and are capitalising on the ingnorance of the media.\\n18. But even assuming that weren\\'t demonstrrably nonsense how is it compatible with the imference that our mode of Brexit would safeguard the jobs of the working classes who depend on single markert trade? Answer: it doesn\\'t.\\n12. The useful idiots of @spikedonline etc will back them because they have given the matter no strategic thougth and still cling on to the 1970\\'s notion that Brexit will deliver absolute and undiluted sovereingty.\\n4. To that effect every Vote Leave politician or spokesman at some point in the campaing cited Norway as a means of market participation. We know of no exceptions. Prior to the latter days of the referendum there was never any fierce opposition to Efta.\\n6. Though they always struggled to produce credible intellectual material they have proven adept at manipulating the debate. With their considerable influence over the Daily Telegraph editorial line, and their powerbase in the ERG, they have warped the debate.\\n8. With the aid of their useful idiots at Spiked Online and their respective knitting circles, they have successfully steered the narrative so that even the suggestion of remaining in the EEA is akin with heracy against democracy.\\n7.

       " '10/ Believe in truth. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power. The Trump Admin &amp; right-wing \\'media\\' deliberately attack facts, science, &amp; truth. Be sure to base your advocacy &amp; #resistance in fact. There are no #AlternativeFacts. https://t.co/98ERut4aKF\\n3/ Beware of the one-party state. Fascism &amp; tyranny prevail when only one party exists. Defend everyone\\'s right to vote, not just your demographic. Beware of attempts to limit the franchise. Vote in every election, especially local and state level. Consider running for office.\\n11/ Investigate. Spend time reading long articles. Subsidize good investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. (I subscribe to the @NYtimes.) There\\'s a lot of propaganda &amp; #fakenews on the Internet, being propagated by nefarious forces. https://t.co/9Aw47VjiFZ\\n8/ Stand out. DO SOMETHING. Don\\'t just follow along as freedoms are eroded. Look to the examples of Ghandi, Dr. King, and Rosa Parks. Actively participate in a group that supports #TheResistance. https://t.co/0zXPon3v3e\\n5/ Remember professional ethics. Concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in cheap labor. Professions can create and maintain an ethical or moral code that stands as a bulwark against regimes seeking to impose tyranny.\\n2/ Defend Institutions. Trump has aggressively sought to undermine all independent institution that opposes his admin, including the free press, the judiciary, DOJ, FBI, &amp; #Mueller. Choose an institution you cherish and take its side.\\n4/ Take responsibility for the face of the world and ensure symbols of bigotry &amp; hate are removed. In America, we\\'ve seen a resurgence of such symbols. KKK, the swastika, and others, often observed side by side w/ #MAGA. https://t.co/tuvmqPxpyH\\n7/ Be reflective if you must be armed. If you are a public servant who carries a weapon, first, thank you for your service. Also know that evils of the past often involved policemen &amp; soldiers following a tyrant\\'s orders. Be ready to say no.\\n12/ Make eye contact &amp; small talk. It\\'s part of being a polite citizen and responsible member of society. Stay connected with your community through real human interaction. This will help break down social barriers and help you know who you can trust.\\n1/ Do not obey in advance. Do not acquiesce or conform to the new regime, offering to comply before compliance is required by law. Hitler\\'s party consolidated power b/c too many citizens offered anticipatory obedience.\\nYale history prof @TimothyDSnyder outlined 20 lessons from the 20th Century on preventing tyranny from overcoming democracy. His book is a must-read for #TheResistance: https://t.co/fDjqHjO3Fr (Thread)\\n9/ Be kind to our language. Think of your own way of speaking. Disconnect from the internet &amp; television from time to time. READ GOOD BOOKS. They help you be reflective and are a source of resilience.\\n6/ Beware of paramilitaries, especially militias that march w/ weapons &amp; torches in support of the emerging tyrannical leader. Trump leveraged his own private security detail to rough up &amp; remove protestors at his rallies. After #Charlottesville Trump refused to condemn neo-nazis https://t.co/A8ryTfPwkA\\n15/ Contribute to good causes. Pick a charity or two &amp; set up auto-pay. Be active in good organizations. I give monthly to @MoveOn,@ActBlue, @UNICEF, @RainforestTrust. I also volunteer for a local charity that helps refugees assimilate into America.\\n14/ Establish a private life &amp; protect your privacy. Scrub your computer of malware regularly. In 2016, we took a YUGE step towards tyranny by accepting as normal the violation of electronic privacy. No one has a private life that can survive public exposure by hostile directive.\\n17/ Listen for dangerous words such as \"extremist\" &amp; \"terrorism.\" Tyrannical regimes often take hold by using dramatic events, staged or otherwise, to make the public fear &amp; acquiesce. Russia uses laws on \"extremism\" to punish those who dare to oppose regime policies.\\n16/ Learn from peers in other countries. Keep up friendships abroad or make new friends in other countries. The current trend away from liberal democracy is not just an American one. Traveling abroad is eye-opening and liberating.\\n13/ Practice corporal politics. Get out of your comfort zone, make new friends, and march &amp; #resist with them. There\\'s a great opportunity coming up on March 24th - #MarchForOurLives. Find out where the nearest event will be &amp; commit to march: https://t.co/1WyET7qNuc\\n19/ Be a #patriot. Set a good example of what America means for generations to come. \\n\\nAs @JasonKander said, \"Patriotism isn\\'t about making everyone stand and salute the flag. Patriotism is about making this a country where everyone wants to.\"\\n18/ Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. Tyrants use sudden disasters to end the autonomy of independent institutions. The Reichstag fire was the moment when Hitler\\'s government became permanent. Trump outwardly praises &amp; admires tyrants like #Putin, #KimJongUn, &amp; #Duterte. https://t.co/wbzmW8lpMh\\n20/ Be courageous. If no one is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny. https://t.co/EWne0RQv3N',\n",
       " \"So of my two threads today, I could produce another three to make it up a hundred reasons - but they all boil down to the same basic thing - that I don't want to be ruled by a remote technocracy that doesn't respond to change - and one which is largely self-serving.\\n15. The fact that even if we could say we had adequate powers of veto we simply cannot trust our own vain and venal governments to use such a veto. The domestic democratic disconnect means the people have no control.\\n9. The Agency Workers Directive:  Yet another whack-a-mole measure to resolve issues caused by the last round of meddling, destroying labour market fluidity and resulting in less secure work with fewer rights.\\n19. The propensity to invest in political white elephants like A380 and Galileo just because it feels it should have rivals to the USA. Weakening the transatlantic bond was dangerous - especially when EU members don't pull their weight in defence spending.\\n17. The fact that political union is not necessary for trade and economic integration. It uses economic integration as a tool to subvert the nation state in pursuit of an ideology which has no popular consent.\\n20 *more* reasons I voted to leave for #Brexit. \\n\\n1. The only people who get to influence the EU are those who support its aims and direction of travel. Everyone else is frozen out - even if elected to the Parliament. They are ringfenced.\\n18. The very existence of the EU and its surpranational agenda actually stands in the way of something better. In an internet age we should be working toward a global single market without barriers. Instead the EU strengthens is own frontiers.\\n20. I just don't like the EU. I don't support its aims, I do not trust its institutions, I don't want a supreme government for Europe and I don't want the power in the hands of so few.\\n13. The measure of the common good is nearly always what the financial spreadsheets say, irrespective of what people might actually want. Power is in the hands of technocrats and powers of veto are increasingly diluted.\\n3. Member states have no right of initiative in international organisations meaning that good ideas die in Brussels if one of the original six has an objection.\\n8. The very idea of being in a treaty structure where all of our external relations and trade is bound up in one single act of parliament. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea?\\n10. The Habitats Directive. Seldom are quota and target driven policies ever a good idea. It results in policy decisions designed to check boxes and avoid fines irrespective of whether they add value.\\n11. The way in which it encourages member states to dismantle their own foreign relations in the greater glory of the EU, taking trade out of the overton window entirely - making national governments more impotent and inward looking.\\n7. The Common Agriculture Policy. An obsolete idea where, like the CFP, reform is glacial and creates massive market distortions favouring agriculture corporates - making rich men richer.\\n6. The Common Fisheries Policy. Even minor changes to protect species take several years, again blocked by corporate lobbying and political populism. I have nothing good to say about the CFP.\\n2. It says it wants free and fair trade but the complexity of its own bureaucracy means it can always find ways within its labyrinth of rules to exclude produce for political reasons irrespective of international trade law.\\nI made my mind up to leave long before there was any mention of a referendum - before Vote Leave existed. Like my fellow eurosceptics, my opposition to EU spans decades. I do not take kindly to airheaded Londoners who know nothing about the EU telling me I voted because of a bus.\\n5. Virtue signalling as public policy. The EU wants to be seen as a benevolent influence so it subscribes to greenwash often with consequences entirely at odds with intent making Europe more dependent on Russian gas.\\nYou'll note that of the reasons given I make no mention of freedom of movement or immigration. I could poke holes in asylum policy and there's a debate to be had about freedom of movement but that's entirely secondary and it always was. #Brexit is primarily about democracy.\\n12. The way in which there is no longer any clear line of accountability. We know longer know who is responsible for what, where the rules come from, why they exist or where to go to change them. Even MEPs are oblivious to the global nature of EU rules.\\n16. The way it undermines genuine multilateral cooperation by setting up rival bodies with a view to co-opting the agenda and gold-plating global measures to strengthen the EU iron curtain.\\n14. The way in which invisible legislative restraints curb local democracy and stifle policy innovations, often forcing councils to spend our money on bureaucratic EU agendas, quangos and other non-jobbery.\\n4. Its energy directives are directed by groupthink, corporate lobbying and political fads leading to environmental destruction (biofuels/palm oils) and takes 20 years to revise the rules.\",\n",
       " 'On GoFundMe specifically, if the person the money is going to isn’t Facebook Verified, don’t donate to them. Google their name and state to see if they are even a real person, or using a real name. GoFundMe doesn’t require that. 20 https://t.co/CuuFFQxHVu\\nHere’s another quote for starting a non-profit in North Carolina. Bizfilings is a reputable company, the non-profit 501c3 I volunteer for uses them to file our tax statement. Their most expensive option comes to $511. 14 #factsmatter https://t.co/LHd7U8lA8S https://t.co/GkI1WEHRdq\\nYou can verify a charity’s non-profit status before donating. Donations to non-profits are always TAX DEDUCTIBLE, so get a receipt! 3 https://t.co/hkPIPlYaLk https://t.co/UGFFWyABYI\\nIt took 10 minutes of Googling to get an idea of what it costs to file for non-profit status in a random state. So if you see someone asking for several thousand dollars to start a non-profit, ask why they need so much and exactly what costs they have. 15 #research https://t.co/ZSotOMfHWx\\nTo act in good faith, one should file for non-profit status FIRST. Once they have their non profit status and an EIN # from the IRS, then they can ask for donations as a non-profit organization. Especially since it’s not that expensive to file for non-profit status. 18 https://t.co/H6cPXFcX17\\nTHE most important questions to ask are about #money – what is the money for? How will it be spent? How can people who donate see where the money has gone and get updates? Who is responsible for handling the money? 9 #accountability #transparency #finances https://t.co/RzF2fMurek\\nAnyone asking for money to start a non-profit or for a “good cause” that isn’t a non-profit needs to be completely transparent about expenses. Non-profits already meet that standard, so individuals should too. Trust is earned with 17 #transparency. https://t.co/qS9gMSSk9d\\nI wrote this because I’ve seen a lot of questionable accounts trying to profit from #TheResistance and I think that’s wrong. Resistors are hard working people and I don’t want anyone getting conned out of their money. 21 #TheMoreYouKnow https://t.co/Q309mkTcCB\\nOver the past few months, several scam accounts have popped up that call themselves #resistance. Some ask for #donations to help impeach Trump. Some sell shirts, phone cases, etc. And there are others that ask for money for various causes. THREAD 1 #scam #donate #con #PSA https://t.co/hkkaTgNHSP\\nAn attorney friend got some quotes for me, and even if you had an attorney handle filing for non-profit status, it would still be below, say, $5,000. So do your research. Ask specific questions and insist on thorough answers. 16 #allaboutthemoney\\nNon-profits are held accountable by law. Fundraising that isn’t for non-profits isn’t bound by those laws, so the people fundraising can do whatever they want with that money. Even disappear with it. 19\\nhttps://t.co/esHRo085kG\\nThis scam has fooled many in #TheResistance. It’s tough - nobody wants to think that someone would lie about having a serious illness. @RachelAzzara 8 #hepzi #grifter #catfish #FridayFeeling https://t.co/AycQVmPfjU\\nA legitimate business who isn’t hiding anything will be ready, able and willing to answer these questions. If they get defensive, don’t answer or avoid the question, that’s a HUGE red flag! DON’T buy from them! 11 https://t.co/luehDFu4wt\\nThere are even people who ask for donations to “start up” non-profits. Evaluate which services the non-profit will provide – do others already fill that need? How much is the person asking for? What does it actually cost to apply for non-profit status? 12 #fishy #suspicious https://t.co/MoUcgN832R\\nThanks @EzraBridger2018! 😘😘😘 https://t.co/RJxpOIJjO7\\nI’ve written about some before, I have a collection of threads about them here. 2 \\nhttps://t.co/rzMhBTYpwi #fraud #con #ripoff #cheat\\nCrowdfunding sites like GoFundMe, YouCaring, Kickstarter, etc. do almost no screening for their fundraising campaigns. Many are for people who need financial help due to hardship or illness. It’s hard to verify if you don’t know the person. 7 https://t.co/tJ4ha2F4Pe https://t.co/hcqQYFpdI6\\n#FundraisingFraud is not uncommon, according to the Better Business Bureau. Online communities like #TheResistance are especially vulnerable to this since we feel like we know people we haven’t met. 6 #fraud #onlinescam https://t.co/T3vktpf0QV https://t.co/whGhRZyMWt\\nIf a fundraiser isn’t a non-profit, ask some questions. First – what are they raising money for? Are there non-profits for the same cause? If so, donate to the non-profit. They are held accountable for how their $ is spent. 5 #protip https://t.co/tab6kFhyyY https://t.co/hJWxjNN8aq\\nIf it’s someone selling merchandise that says a portion of the proceeds will go to charity, a non-profit or resistance related causes, ask for details – when? How? Which causes? By check? How frequently? How will customers know? 10 #smartquestions #question #proof #receipts https://t.co/gTUlWvfvcL\\nFor example, here is pricing for LegalZoom’s non-profit creation service packages, which range from $99 to $359.

He advertised his clothing and tailor shop locally, and his hair products regionally. https://t.co/1zJhH2sJOV\\nTo quote the CHFC in a letter to “Popular Mechanics”: “from the facts at hand it does not appear that it was attended by any extraordinary risk to [Morgan's] own life.” Yes indeed, because of the Hood that he himself invented you racist twits. https://t.co/WqXVMtE2IJ\\nOne of the reasons for #BlackHistoryMonth is that blacks are so often systematically erased from history, or simply forgotten in favor of their fairer-skinned counterparts. Today, we'll learn about Garrett Morgan, one of the greatest of the early 20th century. https://t.co/iK25sVfMCh\\nIn the end, Morgan had his revenge. When the local Country Clubs refused him entry, he simply founded his own, all-black, Country Club. Though rumor has it that Morgan's white friends were welcome, it can just be hard to know if you can trust white folk. https://t.co/lD2FV1seHP\\nMorgan had a saying: “My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P.” The first to adapt that into a sick rhyme gets imaginary internet points.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\\n-Ryan. https://t.co/XBWYUtdb4v\\nHe became so skilled at repairing the sewing machines, they gave him a job as a repairman. Not content with that, Morgan soon invented a retainer for the machine drive belts that reportedly increased  efficiency by 20%.\\nBeing a black man, he was unable to sell his hoods there, so he hired a white friend to pretend to be the inventor, while he took the guise of “Big Chief Mason,” a Native-American who assisted the “white man” with “his invention.”\\nThe KKK would move into Cincinnati as well, and again Morgan fled north to Cleveland, where blacks were far more rare. Eventually, he would be hired as an unskilled laborer at a textile factory, but that would not last long. https://t.co/uMNDhcItjd\\nFew of the white rescuers were willing to trust their lives to a black man's invention, so Morgan, his brother Frank, and a handful of brave volunteers donned the Safety Hood themselves and ventured in. Morgan and his invention saved nine workers that day. https://t.co/uOBgyUgNIy\\nAt the age of 14, Morgan fled north to Cincinnati, away from the active KKK in Kentucky. With only a 6th grade education, he worked during the day, then hired tutors in the evening to complete his education. Four years later,\\nThere was almost nothing that this man could not invent. Meanwhile, he began printing and publishing his own newspaper, targeted towards the black community in the region. He also began traveling back to the South to sell his “Safety Hoods.” https://t.co/Gah9e8nKf8\\nIn 1916, during the development of Lake Erie, a tunnel explosion occurred 50ft below the water. Dozens of workers were trapped, the tunnels were filled with noxious gasses, and two rescue attempts failed, the teams missing in action. Morgan was called to the scene. https://t.co/3ncNpalw7Z\\nBorn in Kentucky in 1877, he was the son of former slaves, reared in the reconstruction South. Actually, he also had European and Native American ancestry too, though, as we will see, this did not stop him from facing widespread discrimination.\",\n",

       " \"2. It involves both the breach of the DNC emails, as well as the famous piss-gate dossier that has been at the heart of the entire #RussiaCollusion narrative from the start.\\n4. Barrack Obama, James Clapper and rogue elements in the CIA found out about Seth Rich using illegal surveillance prohibited by the 4th amendment. Anywhere up to 12 separate people were involved.\\n9. Now it’s Peter Strzok’s “Insurance Policy” in his text messages. This is a plan to create a phony dossier to enable the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump Campaign to find dirt to stop him from taking over the government and exposing their crimes. https://t.co/YP25ODFm9n\\n15. Obama gets daily briefings and has a nice listen to all their private conversations in the hope that Trump is as crooked as they are. Unfortunately for them, he is not, and they can’t find a damn thing connecting Trump with Russia. https://t.co/n62vUfFSDk\\n7. Anyway, they bust Seth Rich and decide to make an example of him to prevent future leaks. He was assassinated using the cabal’s hit squad, MS-13. Look how scared Donna Brazille was when she realized. https://t.co/pXlXEeVTdm\\n18. When they #ReleaseTheMemo, the public will discover not just that this whole Russia collusion story is scam, but all the horrible crimes they’ve been committing for decades that they knew Trump would expose.\\n11. They even hired British Intelligence to help them. People just have no clue how corrupted all the vessels of power and intelligence in this world has been compromised by this global cabal, but it would shock anyone who opens their minds enough to realize it.\\n16. John McCain, a convenient cabal operative in the Republican senate, starts sending this fake dossier to the #FakeNews media, and Buzzfeed is the only outlet stupid enough to get involved with this scam. https://t.co/bnHg9wM3W6\\n1. There’s a lot surfacing that suggests that #ReleaseTheMemo will produce the following rather devastating revelations about a massive criminal cabal leading all the way to the Oval Office. Let me give you a teaser of the memo here. #TheStorm #GreatAwakening #WeThePeople\\n6. Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO, was fired for using Google as a powerful surveillance tool by criminal elements of the CIA. Crowdstrike was used to carry out the master plot of cheating Donald Trump out of the presidency. https://t.co/kTKRcTtwEi\\n#QAnon https://t.co/LZFWEf8NCu\\n10. A lot of bad people involved. Obama, Hillary, head of the Justice department Loretta Lynch, James Comey, Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok, all conspiring to create this dossier.\\n17. It is leaked and the public get to hear for the first time the #RussiaCollusion fantasy cooked up by the entire rotten Obama administration in their desperate attempt to stop Trump from taking the seat of power and exposing their crimes.\\n5. Google funded the IT auditing company Crowdstrike with $100M that was the entity used to run a sham investigation of the DNC server. The FBI’s help was refused and they bizarrely stepped down without a fight.\\n19. America was almost destroyed by criminals, but they’ve been busted. Now the public needs to be ready for the fall of a criminal enterprise on a scale that is quite incomprehensible for most of us. https://t.co/p0EQCb4jfA #TheStormIsHere #WeThePeople #GreatAwakening\\n20. And I didn't even mention the separate crime campaign, the charade investigation of Hillary's shocking abuse of classified materials that led to her inevitable exoneration. #TheStorm #GreatAwakening #ReleaseTheMemoNow https://t.co/cAlsHZ4TOS\\n3. The memo will show that #SethRich, a Bernie-supporting DNC staffer, copied their emails and send them to #Wikileaks to blow the whistle on Hillary’s rigging of the DNC to destroy Sanders.\\n8. Debbie Wusserman Schultz was the one who shut down the investigation into his death, and they get assistance in making it all go away from the corrupted FBI and CIA leadership.\\n12. The money for this dossier came from Hillary’s campaign, the DNC treasury, the Podesta Group and other classified entities who paid Christopher Steel through Fusion GPS. Tried to obscure the flow of money… unsuccessfully.\\n13. Steele gets fake dirt on Trump from the Russians, he passes it over to corrupt Attorney General Eric Holder who, with some other classified coconspirators, starts the FISA application.\\n14. Massive high five for the cabal. They now get FISA authorization from corrupted Loretta Lynch and begin spying on Trump.\",\n",

       " 'Seuls quatre japs échappent au massacre et, conformément à leurs ordres, décident de se batte jusqu’au bout :\\n- le soldat Yūichi Akatsu,\\n- le caporal Shōichi Shimada,\\n- le soldat 1ère classe Kinshichi Kozuka\\n- et le lieutenant Hiroo Onoda.\\nUn retour en arrière s’impose. Un retour en arrière de 29 ans, 1 mois et 21 jours exactement.\\nÀ la fin de cette même année, la propagande alliée s’intensifie : les avions ricains balancent carrément des faux ordres de reddition signés du général Tomoyuki Yamashita.\\n\\nAprès une inspection méticuleuse, les hommes d’Onoda décident que c’est un faux. #FakeNews\\nPour Onoda, c’est évidemment un gros problème de sécurité : il décide donc qu’à partir de maintenant, il faudra se montrer encore plus prudent.\\n\\nÀ partir de ce moment-là, les gars décident de passer en mode furtif. https://t.co/eZcbfitY6i\\nSi les deux derniers items de cette liste vous sont sans doute familiers, vous vous demandez sans doute qui est ce lieutenant Onoda et ce qui peut bien pousser Suzuki à le chercher sur cette île de 125 km² couverte d’une épaisse jungle tropicale.\\nLe 16 février 1974, Norio Suzuki, un explorateur et aventurier japonais, débarque sur l’île de Lubang aux Philippines.\\n\\nLe gars s’est donnée une mission un peu spéciale : il veut trouver « le lieutenant Onoda, un panda et l’abominable homme des neiges, dans cet ordre. » #Thread https://t.co/eDkRVP14y4\\nLa preuve, c’est que le 7 mai 1954 le caporal Shimada se fait descendre par un raid ennemi qui essayait de les débusquer dans la jungle et, le 19 octobre 1972, c’est Kozuka qui se fait tirer dessus par la police locale.\\n\\nOui, 1972.\\nL’ex-major Taniguchi joue le jeu jusqu’au bout et relève formellement Onoda de ses engagements.\\n\\nLe lieutenant se rend donc le jour même soit 28 ans, 6 mois et 7 jours après la signature de la reddition officielle du Japon (2 septembre 1945). https://t.co/4HqSKCBJUK\\nSuzuki rentre donc au Japon avec quelques photos pour prouver qu’Onoda est toujours vivant et se met en quête du fameux major.\\n\\nLe gars, depuis, est devenu libraire et hallucine quand même un peu quand on lui explique ce qu’on attend de lui.\\nNous voilà donc le 28 février 1945, en pleine guerre Pacifique, quand une l’armée américaine débarque sur l’île de Lubang pour la reprendre aux japonais.\\n\\nEn un mois, l’affaire est pliée et 230 japonais chargés de défendre cette position coûte que coûte y laissent la vie.\\nDu coup, Onoda est tout seul. https://t.co/EamoSSQn90\\n(NB : dans la longue liste des gars qui ont connu une aventure similaire, Teruo Nakamura est le recordman absolu : le type s’est fait arrêter le 18 décembre 1974 en Indonésie mais ça faisait déjà un moment qu’il ne se considérait plus comme un soldat.)\\nÀ ce moment-là, Onoda vient à peine de fêter ses 23 ans mais, comme il est le plus gradé de la bande et qu’il descend, par ailleurs, d’une famille de samouraï, il prend le commandement de la petite trouve et décide de se replier dans les collines en mode guérilla.\\nRentré au Japon, il est accueilli comme une véritable star et le gouvernement offre de lui payer ses arriérés de solde… ce qu’il refuse.\\n\\nAprès un détour de quelques années au Brésil, il finit ses jours au pays où il meurt le 16 janvier 2014. https://t.co/XTc6paYLKO\\nEn 1952, les alliés essayent une nouvelle méthode : maintenant, ils droppent carrément des photos et des lettres de leurs familles respectives pour leur faire croire que la guerre et finie.\\n\\nÉvidemment, c’est un piège grossier.\\nEt le temps passe comme ça.\\n\\nEn octobre 1945, ils trouvent bien une brochure qui dit que la guerre est finie depuis août et qu’il faut cesser le combat mais ils en concluent que c’est une manœuvre ennemie pour les amener à se rendre.\\nSauf que, même s’il sympathise avec cette espèce de hippie, Onoda reste méfiant : il ne se rendra que s’il en reçoit l’ordre formel et oral de son supérieur : le major Yoshimi Taniguchi. https://t.co/ZZR4BzaLMU\\nC’est à ce moment-là que Suzuki entre en scène. Persuadé qu’Onoda est toujours vivant alors que tout le monde le croit mort au Japon, il va passer quatre jours à le chercher dans la jungle.\\n\\nLe 20 février 1974, enfin, il lui met la main dessus.\\nQuant à Suzuki, après Onoda, il a trouvé un panda et s’est donc mis en quête de l’abominable homme des neiges. En juillet 1975, il affirmera en avoir vu un dans l’Himalaya.\\n\\nIl est mort en novembre 1986 dans une avalanche… il cherchait encore ce foutu yéti. #Fin https://t.co/cdU9r0LH8i\\nLe 9 mars 1974, Onoda se rend à un endroit sur lequel il s’était mis d’accord avec Suzuki et y trouve une note qui l’informe que le major Yoshimi Taniguchi est sur l’île pour lui donner l’ordre de déposer les armes.\\nBref, nos quatre bonhommes continuent le combat jusqu’à ce que l’un d’entre eux finisse par craquer.\\n\\nC’est le soldat Akatsu : en septembre 1949, il quitte le groupe et, après 6 mois seul dans la jungle, finit par se rendre aux forces philippines.\\nSi vous avez aimé cette histoire, il y a quelques autres ici :\\nhttps://t.co/ylO77M8NvQ\\nQuelques heures plus tard, Onoda se pointe au lieu du rendez-vous avec son fusil en parfait état de fonctionnement, ses munitions, quelques grenades à main et même le sabre que sa mère lui avait donné pour se faire seppuku en cas de capture. https://t.co/z7r7nqVSyF\\nLes ricains repartis, la petite troupe d’Onoda commence donc à harceler la police locale et s’habitue peu à peu à vivre dans la jungle en mode survie.\\n\\nPour survivre, ils piquent des noix de coco, des mangues et du bétail aux fermiers locaux. https://t.co/8b8nxSx8NF',\n",
       " 'I tell this story because I was bullied severely at school. I had guns at my disposal.\\n\\nNobody died.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine shooting someone. I can\\'t understand the desire to go somewhere and shoot people.\\n\\nI\\'m not nuts.\\nThey loved torturing me. However, I have a big mouth, and you can only kick a dog so many times before he bites back.\\n\\nThe leader of the pack really got in my face one day, screaming at me, outside my locker, \"Fag. Fag! FAG!\"\\nHowever, being a big target, I was subjected to lots of personal insults.\\n\\nNerd was a good one. FAG was the favorite. \\n\\nI was called fag day after day.\\nThe people doing this weren\\'t the girls. \\n\\nThey weren\\'t the kids from my neighborhood.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t the burned-out heads.\\n\\nOf course, it was the football players.\\nInstead of getting a gun, and shooting up the place, I turned to my mother.\\n\\nShe called the school, and told the dean how miserable I was for the past couple of years.\\nBullies are a-holes. People who shoot up schools are monsters.\\n\\nNot all football players are a-holes. Not all kids that are bullied shoot up schools. \\n\\nResponsibility lies with the individual. Of course.\\nSo I rode the bus for four years. Nearly the first one on, the last one off.\\n\\nThere was no way I could have afforded a car.\\nThe Florida shooter was a total maniac. He was acting out in every way possible, and practically daring LE to stop him.\\n\\nThey failed.\\nIt was a lot of money, and I thank my cousin for chipping in from time to time. Keeping me from the public school, which was closer, kept me from a lot of drug activity.\\nThe funny thing, is that it never occurred to me to come into the school and shoot up the place.\\nMy father would let me handle any and all of the guns as much as I wanted.\\n\\nBut I had to ask first. Every time.\\n\\nI knew to ask, because my father threatened to break my legs if I didn\\'t. \\n\\nHe was a scary guy, and I believed him. He instilled a healthy respect for guns.\\nI know a little about bullying. Like many people, I experienced this in high school.\\nNow, the ringleader is a head football coach at a Division I university.\\n\\nI wonder if he promotes that attitude at his school. I wonder if he still calls kids \"Fag.\"\\nSo the kid backed off. However, he just sent his proxies. His minions.\\n\\nSo for the few weeks, I had run-ins with some junior classmen. I didn\\'t even know their names.\\n\\nAfter getting into a few quick fights in the hallways, things called down.\\nBullied plus guns doesn\\'t mean people are going to get shot.\\n\\nUnless you\\'re nuts. Unless you\\'re a homicidal maniac.\\nMy mother gave the dean enough detail, that she believed her. \\n\\nThe ringleader was a star football player, and the dean said his father would kill him if he found out.\\nI didn\\'t lose any of those fights.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying I won them, but I held my own. Hit one of them so hard, I shattered his glasses on his face.\\n\\nI didn\\'t even know their names, but I know who sent them.\\nThe guy went bananas. He was gonna beat the crap out of me after school.\\n\\nAnd he could have, handily.\\nWhat he didn\\'t know, was that nearly every weekend for about three years, I reloaded bullets on Saturday, and shot all day Sunday with my father and my cousin.\\nBy the time I was a junior, I was facing daily harassment from some of my classmates.\\n\\nI was a quiet kid, found to a Catholic high school. I was from the poor neighborhood, but me family came together, and collectively paid my tuition.\\nWe reloaded and shot a lot of rounds of .30, .357, .44, .45 long colt, and .223.\\n\\nAn AR-15 shoots .223 ammo.

       " 'With this understanding of what black professionals go through, what can do to create meaningful change? I have a few ideas...\\n1) Would you be willing to make a monthly contribution to a fund that covers legal costs for labour issues faced by black professionals who don’t have the means to pursue legal action for unfair treatment?\\nCorpSA has a deeply rooted culture of discrimination against black professionals. Think of it in the context of domestic violence. When a man physically assaults a woman, we know that’s abuse.\\nAnd at work, it seeps in slowly &amp; quietly with “harmless jokes”, derogatory comments about black hair, black politicians, black culture, black intelligence.\\nI’m always astounded when I think about living in my country, so many years after it was declared “free &amp; fair”, and still be subjected to the viciousness of blatant racism &amp; the wounds of micro-aggression.\\nIs it not crazy that after everything this country has been through, black people are still expected to explain why they feel racially victimized?\\nI’ll never forget when, at Standard Bank, a white man (senior to us) told myself and two other black colleagues that we were wrong &amp; did not understand the black experience or the needs of black customers.\\nThe feigned ignorance &amp; public arrogance that are intended to place the burden of teaching about oppression squarely on the shoulders of the oppressed.\\nWhat about when he takes away her money or the financial provision she depends on him for? And when he swears at her? All of it is abuse. Racism &amp; institutionalized discrimination, with all of their nuances, are no different. They manifest in different ways with one goal: DESTROY\\nI just cannot imagine how we can speak of economic transformation when we can’t even get real equity &amp; equality for black professionals in CorpSA.\\nKnowing that we live in a country where speaking out against injustices is more likely to have you vilified while the perpetrator gets to watch you crash &amp; burn without needing to lift a finger.\\nRacism within the corporate environment thrives because it is incubated in a culture of institutionalized violence against black people &amp; the evasion of accountability at any cost - incl threatening legal action and/or loss of income.\\n5) Can CorpSA be forced to extend their interim &amp; annual reporting to include labour issues, grievances, resolutions, etc? Forced, audited (not by KPMG) transparency?\\n4) Can we put in place mechanisms that will protect whistleblowers from being bullied at work or subjected to constructive dismissal?\\nIs it not crazy that there are people who try to make believe that as long as the k-word isn’t used, it can’t possibly be a racist attack?\\nSo I just saw this on FB... https://t.co/rvHtMqwJkB\\n3) Can we establish, promote &amp; celebrate a culture of whistle-blowing that goes beyond financial fraud &amp; forces corporate accountability &amp; equality for black professionals?\\nAs a single mom, I wrestled with whether or not to speak up, whether or not to risk my job, whether being vocal about my experiences would mean that no other organization would be willing to employ me. Thing is, this doubt is what gives oppression space to grow.\\nThe only time things will change is when we force that change. And we have to start now. #BlackProfessionalsFightBack\\n2) Can we establish a platform that becomes a repository that equips black professionals in the workplace on labour-related matters, educating on their rights and assisting with understanding employment contracts &amp; negotiating fair terms?\\nThe fact that I could work at Standard Bank, with a workload that far exceeded my white counterparts and earn half of what they earned directly reflects the pervasive nature of racism &amp; its role in discrimination because it is a system.\\nAnd what we’re left with is depression, mental &amp; physical breakdowns, inability to sleep, excessive anxiety, emotional trauma, heart attacks, strokes, joblessness and sometimes, death.\\nThere are very things in the world more frustrating than trying to explain racism, privilege &amp; discrimination to people who are the perpetrators &amp; beneficiaries of those oppressive systems.\\nIf you have a story to share, ideas that can help or want to get actively involved, please use #BlackProfessionalsFightBack so that I can see your contribution and/or get in touch with you.',\n",
       " '12/ As for the public evidence in the Manafort case, here\\'s what we know: with the superseding indictments Mueller plans to bring soon, Manafort\\'s *easily* looking at spending the rest of his life in a federal prison and running out of money to pay his attorneys long before then.\\n7/ Keep in mind two things about Trump and Manafort:\\n\\n1. They knew each other for years before Trump made Manafort his Campaign Manager. (They lived in the same building—Trump Tower—for years.)\\n\\n2. The two kept speaking by phone for at least six months after Trump fired Manafort.\\n2/ Three weeks ago, NBC all but reported that Trump has incriminated himself in private calls to friends. I\\'ve no idea why this reporting didn\\'t become major national news—frankly, I expect whoever dimed him out thought it would be. And it still should be. https://t.co/I0Q7QpmPkA\\n6/ While one could use a phrase like \"stab me in the back\" to describe a criminal defendant who makes up a story about someone else to save themselves, to \"flip\" is to make a \"proffer\" to the prosecutor to the effect that you can offer evidence to incriminate and convict another.\\n15/ Manafort also knows that Mueller can basically flip any witness he wants (assuming they\\'re Americans currently on U.S. soil; foreigners are harder for Mueller to access). \\n\\nSo it\\'s not clear what in the *world* would make Trump or Manafort optimistic about Manafort\\'s chances.\\n16/ Trump has only two cards to play on Manafort:\\n\\n1. Pardon him.\\n2. Fire Mueller (and then, likely, get impeached).\\n\\nManafort has only *one* card to play, based on public information:\\n\\n1. Wait for Trump to pardon him.\\n\\nAnd we know this:\\n\\n1. Trump\\'s confident Manafort won\\'t flip.\\n(THREAD) Per NBC, Trump has told friends he\\'d be in trouble if Paul Manafort \"flipped\" on him—clearly signaling that Manafort can incriminate him and get him impeached. By that measure, today\\'s events have brought Trump closer than ever to impeachment. Hope you\\'ll read and share. https://t.co/Dzlj534bcE\\n17/ Add to those facts Trump\\'s long relationship with Manafort, prior clandestine contacts with him, and demonstrated willingness to tamper with witnesses in a federal criminal investigation, and I\\'m telling you anyone in Mueller\\'s shoes would assume Trump has contacted Manafort.\\n3/ In common and legal parlance, to \"flip\" on someone is to agree to testify against them in a criminal case. A current defendant like Paul Manafort would only flip on someone if they had sufficient incriminating evidence to offer their prosecutor that they could cut a plea deal.\\nPS/ Never forget that—after it was clear Flynn was under criminal investigation—Trump called his former advisor in April \\'17 to tell him to \"stay strong.\" He also leaked to the press that he\\'d wanted to rehire him. To think Trump would work *less* to keep Manafort close is naive.\\n13/ His main co-conspirator—his deputy, Rick Gates—will soon get a plea deal, meaning that he\\'s already told Mueller and his agents, in *detail*, of *every single criminal act he ever saw Manafort engage in*. Gates\\' assistance appears to have led to another charge and plea today.\\n11/ If you doubt this, look at the question via a different angle: what *public* information could Trump *possibly* be looking at to so smugly—with such certitude—be telling confidants there\\'s *no* chance that Manafort will flip on him? *All* the *public* evidence says otherwise.\\n19/ So a reasonable \"theory of the case\" from the standpoint of a seasoned CJS professional would include these facts:\\n\\n1. There\\'s a good chance Trump is tampering with Manafort.\\n2. Trump thinks Manafort can incriminate him.\\n3. Manafort doesn\\'t trust Trump.\\n4. Manafort will flip.\\n8/ Let\\'s focus on the second item. It means Trump kept up a clandestine relationship with Manafort for half a year after he publicly disavowed him. It also means that he was speaking to Manafort long after it had become clear that Manafort would be a witness in the Mueller probe.\\n20/ If you assume—and you should—Mueller is working from these four very reasonable and basic assumptions, you can (a) understand everything Mueller is doing right now, and (b) see just how close Mueller is getting to nailing Trump and referring impeachable offenses to DOJ. {end}\\n10/ My point is that there\\'s every reason to believe—as Trump has done this with *other* Mueller witnesses—that a) Trump believes Manafort can incriminate him, and b) he\\'s found ways to stay in contact with Manafort, so that Manafort understands he can expect a pardon from Trump.\\n4/ So when NBC reported—3 weeks ago—that \"Trump is telling friends and aides in private that things are going great for him [because] he\\'s decided a key witness in the Russia probe, Paul Manafort, isn\\'t going to flip and sell him out,\" they were saying he\\'s incriminated himself.\\nNOTE/ In Tweet #8, I deliberately referred to what was at the time the \"Comey probe\" as the \"Mueller probe\"—simply not to confuse people. Trump and Manafort last spoke in February 2017, and Mueller wasn\\'t appointed until May 2017. But Mueller\\'s probe is a continuation of Comey\\'s.\\n9/ Indeed, because Manafort worked for Trump for six months (not the three Trump claims) for *free*, it\\'s not at all clear that his role in Trump\\'s life changed much after he was fired in late summer 2016: he was an unpaid advisor to Trump both before and after his sudden firing.\\n14/ He (Manafort) is facing the most talented team of federal criminal prosecutors assembled for the purpose a single criminal investigation in the last half-century. Also, not for nothing, Manafort is—as Manafort knows—100% and unalterably guilty of everything he\\'s charged with.\\n5/ NBC put the word \"flip\" in quotes—meaning Trump confidants say that\\'s the word he\\'s using. That\\'s not a word Trump or anyone would use for the only other possible fear that Trump could have been referring to with Paul Manafort—that Manafort will make up an incriminating story.\\n18/ But there\\'s another thing: if Manafort knows Trump, he knows Trump can\\'t be trusted. He *certainly* knows he can\\'t trust Trump with his *life*.\\n\\nAnd he *also* knows he\\'s a primary Mueller target—so he can\\'t \"flip\" for a deal unless and until he can *deliver Trump to Mueller*.',\n",
       " 'Yes, Bush was clever. But that\\'s not so interesting. I think it\\'s more interesting to think about the big, broad fundamental questions he was addressing, and how far we are from really solving them.\\nHow to manage information overload? What are the real bottlenecks? How can we make vastly better computer note taking systems? Why haven\\'t we gone beyond the file metaphor? How can we build better personal memory systems? Better collective memory systems? So many great problems!\\n\"As We May Think\" is part of a tiny genre: a grand vision document that\\'s extremely insightful, and which becomes incredibly influential. It\\'s tempting to say prescient, but the essay actually helped create its imagined future.\\nBack to Bush: it\\'s fun to see how many ideas still haven\\'t entirely come to fruition. Here he is on sharing entire lines of thought and investigation, a sort of super-@pinboard or -@pinterest. Keep in mind, this is 1945: https://t.co/WuOg4NYQcZ\\n\"As We May Think\" seems to me like the writings of Locke or Montesquieu: a set of ideas that decisively influenced major parts of our cultural operating system. In one case, the US Constitution (&amp; the many others influenced), in the other, the web &amp; computer software more broadly\\nI say information overload is \"insoluble\", but that\\'s a pessimistic way of framing it. A much better way is that it\\'s an open-ended problem: we can always do better. I won\\'t be surprised if many grand vision documents of the future will also focus on that problem.\\nA few notes on Vannevar Bush\\'s amazing essay, \"As We May Think\", from the 1945(!) @TheAtlantic : https://t.co/epxmwiaB0n\\nHere\\'s Bush describing so much of the web and wikidom (again: 1945): https://t.co/IWODC7JnPK\\nJust a small appendix. Reading back over my thread, it\\'s got too much of the \"gee-whiz, wasn\\'t that a clever insight of a giant of the past\" trope about it.\\nOf course, information overload is intrinsically an insoluble problem. Understanding is so valuable that we will always push ourselves to our limits in managing information, no matter how good our tools become, &amp; feel uncomfortable as we push up against them.\\nSatoshi stands out as different, being much more focused on co-ordination problems.\\nAnother striking difference: all the later vision documents eventually led to working systems, and that was a big part of their success (especially the web and Bitcoin). Bush\\'s vision did not. And yet it was hugely influential anyway.\\nIt\\'s fascinating that he\\'s imagining this all through the lens of analog machines. In fact, Bush never really got into digital computing. It passed him by. But hardware aside, he was thinking about the right problems and at a great level of design abstraction.\\n... Stallman on free software (the GNU manifesto and the GPL), @timberners_lee on \"Information Management: a Proposal\" (https://t.co/Spw3UdTKe4), and perhaps Satoshi on Bitcoin (https://t.co/iJZv8FYxfg ) - time will tell.\\nAnd @TrevorFSmith\\'s memex:\\n https://t.co/PE34AhekSl\\nIt\\'s fun to consider \"As We May Think\" as part of a line of successful grand vision documents: Engelbart on \"Augmenting Human Intellect\"\\n(https://t.co/YBme2bkLuP ), Alan Kay on \"A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages\" (https://t.co/jLL7XbhLPR ) ...\\nBetter tools expand the limits of the information we can manage, but do little to change our desire to go still further, because that desire is only very weakly a function of the quantity of information we can currently manage.\\nHere\\'s Bush on neural interfaces: https://t.co/yNN3VtuAre\\nMore recurring themes: not just information management, but also memory, note-taking, association of ideas, and problem-solving. None of these problems have yet been solved well, IMO.\\nAnyways, there\\'s much, much more in the article. Well worth reading!\\nMore fun things: see @hyfen\\'s project to build a memex: https://t.co/TkvuS3QvA3\\nIn particular, Engelbart, Kay, and @timberners_lee all return to the theme of information overload, in different ways. @timberners_lee\\'s title is \"Information Management: A Proposal\".\\nOne thing that stands out: managing information overload is a recurring obsession. Bush has his Memex (memory extender), with which he hoped to improve in some ways on the associative operation of the human mind, especially in permanence and clarity: https://t.co/kxidXPXnVh\\nIt\\'s not clear how many of the authors had ambitions to write influential grand vision documents. Mostly, I think, they were obsessed with important fundamental problems whose time was nearly ripe - so obsessed that they stumbled on some very good ideas, which they then developed',\n",
       " '5. The pain of that experience remains vivid, and because that pain was deepened by the election of Obama\\'s antithesis, the natural—and understandable—reaction is outrage.\\n15. Is there a social cost to giving Trump a (small) platform to lie? Yes, obviously. But there are also benefits. We are going to be talking about the president\\'s reedy mental capacity long after we stop debating this Times interview.\\n20. Liberals feared profiling Hovater would \"normalize\" fascism. I\\'m sure someone somewhere thought it must be normal if fascism is in the Times, but mostly people reacted as they should: with utter horror.\\n2. In an honest debate, it must be said that no journalist would have let Barack Obama say what Trump said without challenging him. The former president was asked to explain everything, to justify everything.\\n12. https://t.co/Torxxq9ymj\\n4. There is no doubt in my mind the injustice of Obama\\'s experience colored the reaction to reporter Michael Schmidt\\'s impromptu interview with Trump at the president\\'s Florida resort.\\n18. Bear in mind that journalism is about shedding light on things hiding in shadow. Power and corruption thrive in darkness. So does evil.\\n11. Trump is not Obama. He can\\'t handle questioning. His ego is a desiccated husk. He can\\'t lie well. He would end an interview. Faced with this, Schmidt had to choose: Let him say whatever he wants or risk losing the interview.\\n23. Learning can\\'t happen without journalism, however, without people willing to illuminate shadow. Schmidt\\'s light was dim, but it was still light.\\n21. Again, there is a social cost to doing journalism, but there is also much to gain.\\n10. Obama is a thinker and writer, a man who thrives on complexity, nuance and ambiguity. Confident in his abilities, humbled by the presidency, Obama could handle any question, even if he had to fudge it.\\n1. An honest debate over Thursday\\'s New York Times interview with President Donald Trump must broach what few journalists want to broach: racism as a mediating force in how they do their jobs.\\n24. https://t.co/Torxxq9ymj\\n22. In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote that democracy is prone to damaging fits of passion and error. Even so, he wrote in 1835, it is still an opportunity for participants to learn.\\n3. Everything—right down to his choice of suits.\\n17. Then we would not know he truly has no idea how health care works, among other things. We would not know that his cognition appears impaired, nor that he is clearly freaked by special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation.\\n6. Here\\'s America, allowing a white president to say whatever falsehood he wants while a black president can\\'t speak truth plainly.\\n13. You could say Schmidt was cowardly. You could say he\\'s hopelessly biased for being a part of the Times team that made a fetish of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\\'s email server. You could call him a racist.\\n7. I deeply sympathize with this. It is honest, and truth is above all else necessary to freedom. But it\\'s out of a need for honesty that we must keep asking questions: Is the issue how journalists treat Trump—or is it how they treated Obama?\\n16. What if Schmidt had been more assertive? My guess is Trump would have stopped the interview—as it was taking place at his resort, among his guests, including Schmidt—and there was no pressure to keep talking, as there would have been had Trump been speaking on live TV.\\n9. My point here rests on a plain truth. Trump is not Obama. Obama would never have stopped an interview because of tough questioning.\\n8. The press should have treated Obama better. But that does not mean Schmidt should have been more aggressive with Trump. It does not mean Schmidt should have nipped his lies in the bud. It does not mean he should have demanded the president explain his delusions.\\n14. All of that is fair game, I suppose, but none of that adequately explains his decision; it does not take into account circumstances informing a journalist\\'s choices, nor the trade-offs inherent in those choices.\\n19. Liberals blasted the Times last month for profiling a neo-Nazi. What most don\\'t know is the neo-Nazi, Tony Hovater, paid a price for seeking the light: He and his wife lost their jobs, and they had to leave town.',\n",

       " 'Passwords\\n\\nMost of your online identity is tied to an email address.Often the same address is used for password reset requests, communications, and a way to validate your identity when you create accounts.\\nWifi Router\\n\\nWe suggest using WPA2-PSK (AES) protocol. It is very important to change the user name and login on your router. Both of them. Do not use the manufacturer defaults!! Use the password manager mentioned above to generate a secure password.\\nIf you are using a Mac there is one more suggestion. A program called Little Snitch. Once setup it will block and notify you of any unusual inbound traffic. It will not let the traffic through unless you approve.\\nWe suggest using at least 16 characters for your passwords, and include all character types (letters, upper and lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Dashlane is another great option.\\n\\nThese programs work and communicate across all platforms.\\nProtecting your email address and the passwords that are associated with it is the key to protecting your identity.\\nA good and free way to accomplish this is by setting up a free account through ProtonMail. The free accounts have their limitations but will cover many people’s needs. ProtonMail is encrypted end to end, and is based in Switzerland, protecting you with Swiss privacy law.\\nEmail\\n\\nThe next step is to use an encrypted email service for any private or sensitive communications, and for account logins. Email content that is encrypted before being sent in an encrypted form can not be read by an intruder who gains access to a mail server.\\nThis is typically done via sending a code over text message to your phone number. \\nWe also recommend not using security questions. If someone knows you well enough they may know the answers.\\nGoogle Voice will allow you to get a phone number in the area code that you desire and point it to your regular number. It works seamlessly and should that phone number become compromised you can remove it and assign a new number while protecting your regular phone number.\\nSocial Media and Online Memberships\\n\\nFor social media accounts such as Twitter and Facebook, use two-step or two-factor authentication. This means that a second identifying step needs to be taken when logging into a social media account.\\nCertainly its cheaper than a stolen identity, and its always easier to address security upfront than it is if you experience a breach.\\nCriminals who obtain email address/password pairs from a data breach will use this information to attempt to log on - as you - to your bank, PayPal, eBay, Amazon... You can imagine the resulting damage.\\nA VPN encrypts your data as it moves through the internet, and hides your IP address and other identifying information. ExpressVPN is a good option.\\nIt allows locking the app separately from the rest of the device, phone calls generally have greater call quality and reliability. Signal is another great option.\\nPhone\\n\\nIf you are worried about your phone number being compromised as you are doing work and have a need to talk with people you may not know or trust there is a solution.\\nIf data is stolen from a business or social media entity that you have subscribed to, your email address and the password you used for that service will be sold on the black market.\\nText and Voice Communications\\n\\nFor phone calls, text messaging, video chats, end to end encryption is also important to make sure no one is listening in. Wire seems to be have the best features for most users.\\n#unhackthevote\\n\\nThe world is a different place right now. We need to protect our privacy. Not just Candidates. All of us.\\n\\nKeep your online identity from being stolen and misused, with little to no cost.\\n\\n A Tutorial on how we all can make online activity more secure.\\n\\nThread\\nUnfortunately, almost any password you can remember can be cracked. A password manager such as LastPass enables you to create one master password that unlocks your “vault”, where you can safely store secure passwords that the program will generate for you.\\nFinally, if you are involved in any political work - for a candidate or as an activist, these steps aren’t just for your protection. They are necessary to protect your friends and allies. You don’t want a compromise on your end to hurt them. So stay safe and stay protected.\\nFor this reason it is VERY important to never reuse passwords, and to use passwords that can\\'t easily be “cracked\".\\n\\nRule of thumb is if you can remember the password it is not secure enough!!\\nFor added security, ProtonVPN offers a feature called Secure Core, where data is moved through their data center a second time, having already been encrypted.\\nIn order for this program to work and provide end to end encryption you need to have both the sender and recipient using the platform.\\nFor little or no cost, you’ve just VASTLY improved your safety online.\\nBrowsing Privacy\\n\\nAnother thing you want to keep private are your browsing habits. Your online life is nobody\\'s business but yours, but unless you use a VPN (virtual private network) it is very easy for a third party to monitor your internet use.',\n",

Shifting the goal posts over and over and over again to justify the \\nmandate. But if we aren\\'t getting the unicorns how can there still be a mandate?\\nYet how can we possibly know what the will of the people is, if the information they made their decision on was flawed? It\\'s like failing someone on a maths test because you gave them the wrong numbers to work with and now it doesn\\'t match your answer sheet.\\nTaking all this into account (including the deafening hypocrisy of \"respect the vote\" bollox spewed by eurosceptics who haven\\'t shut since the first ref 40 yrs ago). How can you just shrug your shoulders and say \"oh well.\" It\\'s your democratic duty to oppose it.\\nYou might not care about non-UK cits.

Just having a vote is the most basic level. The idea according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Art 21) is that the elections should be \"free and fair.\"\\nIt\\'s a PROCESS. Not an end product. You don\\'t do it just the once. Remainers/leavers who insist we should respect the vote are either not aware of the threat democracy is currently under or they don\\'t understand the concept of democracy.\\nI mean people like Farage may have actually committed TREASON.

It\\'s my democratic duty to oppose it. If you think #Brexit is still OK and you\\'re gonna still get your unicorn then good luck to you.\\nWith that said don\\'t forget that all EU and UK/EU citizens can vote in the #LE2018.

Kathleen Willey, the woman who said Bill Clinton groped her in the Oval Office, claimed she was the target of an unusual house burglary over that nabbed a manuscript for her upcoming book with revelations that could have damage Hillary\\'s presidential campaign.\\n3. His father is Lloyd Shearer, former editor of\\xa0Parade\\xa0magazine who wrote often gossipy and reputation-ruining articles. Lloyd was friends with the Clintons. A sign was erected over Lloyd Shearer\\'s guest house: \\'\\'Bill Clinton slept here.\\'\\' https://t.co/s2K17lm642\\n20. I wasn\\'t old enough to be politically savvy in 1999 when this story broke. Chris Matthews asked Kathleen Willey about the mysterious jogger who threatened her, her children and the cat. Chris Matthews asked \"Is it a Shearer?\"\\nhttps://t.co/bzC04PZgaD\\n16. similar question arose during Sen. Fred Thompson\\'s long, comprehensive, and inconclusive hearings into the Democratic Party\\'s 1996 campaign fund-raising shenanigans. There, Shearer\\'s name popped up in the course of Sen. Don Nickles\\' angry questioning of Terry Lenzner\\n11. Shearer was aiding Blumenthal in these “intelligence” efforts.  Gawker published an email from May 2011, Shearer appeared to be serving as the liaison between Blumenthal and “Grange,” the former Army general and CEO of Osprey.\\n10. He was touting leaders of the Libyan rebel movement with whom he had business dealings and pushing for the hire of private military contractors while working as an adviser to Osprey Global Solutions, a contracting company seeking to do business in Libya\\n9. In 2011, as a State Department-sanctioned revolution against the Qaddafi regime in Libya was picking up steam, longtime Clinton consigliere Sidney Blumenthal was sending “confidential” intelligence memos to Hillary Clinton. .\\n21. The same Chris Matthews who got a thrill up his leg when Obama ran, the same MSM who has a boner lasting more than 4 hours when they saw Kim Jong Un\\'s sister at the Olympics. Will someone ask \"is it a Shrearer?\" When it involves treason against a sitting US president? \\n-Fin\\n14. Turns out the word \"opposition research\" is not new and Cody Shearer is not new to conducting it. Slate in 1999 wrote \"Shearer who, during the 1992 presidential campaign, introduced the world--through the unlikely medium of\\xa0Doonesbury--to Brett Kimberlin.\"\\n1. \"Digging for Filth: A detour into the shadowy world of Clinton acolytes\" \\nPreferably read this in conjunction with my Tale of Two dossiers quoted below. https://t.co/iOqACJJDvZ\\n7. little else was taken from her rural Virginia home as she slept alone upstairs -- electronics and jewelry were left behind. She blamed the Clinton\\'s for it. There was a man who threatened her just prior to her testimony against President Clinton the so called \"jogger\"\\n17. Lenzner was private investigator who would later, in the thick of the Jones/Lewinsky/Willey matter, be accused of coordinating efforts to smear and intimidate those women.\\n4. Bill and Hillary Clinton were college friends of his elder son and Cody\\'s brother, Derek.  Derek Shearer was eventually named ambassador to Finland; his sister, Brooke, became a senior adviser to the secretary of the interior.\\n13. Much of the intelligence contained in memos fed to the Clinton State Department by Blumenthal was not just self-serving — it was provided by someone with a history of misrepresenting himself as an agent of the U.S. government. https://t.co/fZh0OohLt6\\n15. \"Kimberlin was the convicted bomber, habitual liar, and all-around sociopath who claimed to have sold drugs to Dan Quayle. Was Shearer acting on behalf of the legendary Clinton \"opposition research\" outfit?\"\\n5. A series of columns Cody Shearer wrote on the sexual proclivities of former Texas senator John Tower sank his nomination for defense secretary in 1989. \\nInterestingly senator Tower and his daughter died in a plane crash. There were no survivors. https://t.co/Dj0oZh7CUf\\n18. Shearer acted as a liaison between Lenzner\\'s firm, Investigative Group International, and Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe. The tribe had donated more than $100,000 to the Dems, hoping that administration would intervene on its behalf in a dispute over drilling rights on tribal land\\n19. Using the amazing gift of hindsight it is fairly clear even to a minimally discerning reader that the Clinton machine was perfecting it deceit/ intimidation/bribery and pay to play machinery. They used Shadow men to damage reputations and heap threats on the non-compliant.\\n2.Few people have heard of Cody Shearer, a Clinton flunky who was funneling \"intelligence reports\" Sidney Blumenthal was channeling to Hillary Clinton during her time at the State Department.\\n12. They organized small team of contractors to conduct an unspecified mission to the Libyan border from Tunisia. Cody was in frequent contact with “K,” a Libyan named Khalifa al Sherif who seems to be feeding Shearer intelligence reports from inside Libyan revolutionary council',\n",

De surcroît, il appuie la demande de documents de Nunes CONTRE SON ministre de la Justice... RT https://t.co/WVJau255vA\\n22) Ce à quoi #Sessions pourra répondre au président #Trump qu\\'il y a eu surveillance de membres soupçonnés de la campagne (Page, Papadopoulos, Clovis) dans le cadre d\\'1 enquête de contre-espionnage classique. Pour lui, ça suffira à exciter encore plus sa base contre #Mueller...\\n21) D\\'autre part, #Trump formule sa demande au ministère de la Justice de façon à donner au ministère de la Justice de #Sessions une sortie...tout en excitant sa base abreuvée de complots anti-#Trump par Fox News. Il demande s\\'il y a eu espionnage ou surveillance à but POLITIQUE\\n4)...et le #FBI a commencé cette enquête juillet 2016 sur la campagne #Trump après les confessions de beuverie de #Papadopoulos, conseiller diplo, à 1 diplomate australien et à cause de l\\'embauche par Trump de Carter Page, depuis longtemps soupçonné d\\'être 1 agent de la #Russie..\\n8) Nunes a assigné le ministère de la Justice et le FBI début mai pour obtenir toutes les infos possibles sur l\\'informateur, suggérant ensuite que ce dernier était à l\\'origine de l\\'enquête sur #Trump et avait espionné la campagne...https://t.co/TSP0stzJMi\\n5) D\\'après le @washingtonpost, il apparaît donc  logique que le #FBI ait d\\'abord déployé 1 informateur pour aller à la pêche aux renseignements humains auprès de potentiels suspects (Page mi-juillet puis Papadopoulos en août).Du travail de contre-espionnage,n\\'en déplaise à #Trump\\n9) Nunes a, en fait, repris la technique déjà utilisée pour son fameux\"mémo\" où il essaya, sans grand succès, de prouver que l\\'enquête du #FBI avait bidouillé sa demande d\\'écoute à 1 juge FISA sur Carter Page à l\\'automne 2016. Il veut créer 1 contre-feu absolu pour #Trump...\\n6) En tout cas, l\\'informateur en question n\\'a JAMAIS été engagé DANS la campagne #Trump et contrairement à ce que vociférait le président, il a pris contact avec certains de ses conseillers APRES le début de l\\'enquête sur l\\'ingérence avec la #Russie. En aucun cas,1 déclencheur.\\n19) La formulation du tweet de #Trump démontre qu\\'on est dans 1 pur contre-feu médiatique, après le #breaking dévastateur du @nytimes sur la réunion de son fils.D\\'1 part,il se garde bien de demander au ministère de la Justice la publication des infos classifiées sur l\\'informateur\\nHier et avant-hier, le président #Trump, ainsi que ses soutiens, laissaient entendre que le #FBI avait infiltré 1 taupe pour espionner sa campagne 2016. Cette accusation était gravissime, il y a eu du nouveau dans la nuit...#thread #breaking https://t.co/I5XIo4PwsB\\n3) La chronologie est essentielle pour bien comprendre le déploiement de l\\'informateur: il ressortait, même de documents pro #Trump comme le mémo #Nunes, que le #FBI commença son enquête sur de possibles liens entre la campagne et la #Russie début juillet 2016...\\n10) Comme le ministère de la Justice et le FBI ont refusé d\\'accéder aux demandes de #Nunes, qui aboutiraient sans nul doute au dévoilement de l\\'identité de l\\'informateur (imaginez le risque alors couru par cet homme et ses sources passées), #Trump lui-même s\\'en est mêlé...\\n12) Bref, l\\'article #breaking du @washingtonpost désamorce en grande partie ce nouveau contre-feu du camp #Trump contre l\\'enquête #Mueller et le #FBI avec cependant 2 grandes questions qui restent en suspens...(attention, c\\'est le moment\"Je tease\"dans le #thread...)',\n",

       " 'And to a degree it is. Women VERY frequently say one thing and mean another, display expressions or reactions that don\\'t jibe with their feelings, and so on. But it\\'s actually really easy to decode once you understand why it happens. It is survival behavior.\\nMen are not only -not- required to learn dissembling, they -are- taught to seek affirmation of self-worth from women. They take these reactions at face value because they very much want to. And this can build uncomfortable or dangerous cycles and relationships.\\nBy the time a man reaches adulthood he has probably heard that women constantly say one thing and mean another, and that they are impossible to understand, at least a thousand times. To some extent he probably believes this to be true.\\nSome of these dudes around them are extremely dangerous, others are not, and most of the time it is impossible to tell the two apart on sight, or even from extended contact. Often the only way to find out is to say or do something that might make a man blow up and see if he does.\\nSeeing some folks I follow circulating a point that\\'s worth drawing a bit of attention to. One of the oldest canards in low-denominator comedy is that women are inscrutable and men can\\'t understand them. There\\'s a reason for this and it ain\\'t funny.\\nLemme be real clear on this point: Women do this because the way our society is currently set up, they have absolutely no better option available to them. They quite rightly value their safety over offering legibility to people who might seriously hurt or even kill them.\\nWhile some men choose to become skilled dissemblers, men are not -required- to learn very much subterfuge at all-- looking calm while you\\'d like to strangle your boss is the biggie. Women face a completely different situation.\\nWhat that means is smiling at a man\\'s flirting in a closed or isolated space, or laughing at an uncomfortable joke because the room is full of men and all of them are laughing.\\nWomen spend their lives surrounded by people who are, on average, bigger than they are, socially privileged over them, both more inclined to immediate anger (testosterone is a hell of a thing) AND more socially encouraged to express it, and best of all? Cherry on top?\\nThis is not a great way of finding out what kind of guy a woman is dealing with for the same reason we don\\'t use pogo sticks to test for buried land mines. It\\'s often the only one available, though. So, VERY SENSIBLY, women will generally just opt not to run the test.\\nThere\\'s a good chance that when you spot this, your first instinct is going to be to say something like \"Am I making you uncomfortable?\" or \"Did I say something wrong?\" That\\'s what a good dude would ask, right? Welllll it\\'s not the worst response but it\\'s not a good one, either.\\nThat\\'s not some kind of cheat-code to human interaction, mind. People are complicated as fuck and women don\\'t come off an assembly line at a factory.\\nSo while this may be frustrating to guys, it is not on women to behave differently as long as the social baseline for masculine behavior is a toxic stew of lionized violence and anger. They\\'re gonna smile and laugh as long as a huge % of men present a serious potential threat.\\nOh and this should go without saying but if you put forward the promise that you\\'re not going to blow up, for the love of fuck, STICK TO IT. Offering a guy candor is an act of trust, be worthy of it.\\nBut it\\'s generally a better base-line set of guidelines for social navigation than either taking everything at face value or assuming the female mind was forged from the same inscrutable mystic bullshit as Harry Potter\\'s wand.\\nor, her rejoinder doesn\\'t match what you put out there-- a compliment, for example, eliciting \"Thanks\" or \"haha\" rather than a return compliment. All of these have a good chance of translating to \"you are overstepping my boundaries but I don\\'t feel safe saying so.\"\\ntl;dr: Women have simple needs (safety) and live in a more dangerous world than men, which requires more precautions to maintain safety than most dudes have to worry about. Mocking them or getting mad at them for exercising basic safety precautions is an asshole move.\\nBut let\\'s say that you weren\\'t raised by fucking spiders and your reaction to this isn\\'t annoyance but instead serious concern, because you DON\\'T want to freak women out but now you realize you might have been reading \"oh god go away\" as \"yes chat me up more in this elevator.\"\\nA few simple tells that you\\'re doing something that\\'s putting a woman\\'s hackles up, which will follow outward affirmative signals: She leaves the area; she changes the subject; she moves herself or the two of you toward other people, esp. other women; she doesn\\'t flirt/joke back;\\nUnderstand the world you\\'re part of, practice empathy for people who got dealt a different hand in the game of life than you did, and don\\'t be an asshole, the world has too many of those already. It\\'s not that hard once you know what you\\'re doing. The End.\\nIt puts the woman on the spot and makes her pull off an immediate calculation-- is this guy actually concerned or is he feeling offended because he realized that wasn\\'t a real laugh? Am I in more danger now, or less?\\nThose questions have a very good chance of getting back a response calculated to calm you down rather than an honest answer, because you have STILL offered no real indication you won\\'t blow up when rebuffed. You see, those are also questions an irritated dude would ask.\\nIf you are in doubt it\\'s usually best to back off, provide some breathing room, and then once the situation has a low threat index (non-confined space, potentially supportive people nearby), boot up honesty.exe:\\n\"Hey, if the jokes about clown dicks are over the line, please let me know and I\\'ll cut that out.\" Not just interrogation about her real feelings, but proactive information about the reaction that an honest response will provoke from you.',\n",

Burkman releases a statement through Selig on 1/16/18: https://t.co/g7L0sv5QX4\\n19. On 2/1/18- Gates attorneys inform the court they wish to step down from his case. There is no way to know why, because the reasons are under seal. https://t.co/QGqFLiMoCV It is now assumed that Gates is working a deal with the special counsel.\\n21.

On 1/9/2018, Jack Burkman is attacked outside of his home. As per Burkman, a black SUV is parked in the driveway, and a man with a mask jumps out and accosts Burkman and sprays him with pepper spray.

       " 'Of the four post-war Presidents with low approval ratings who sought re-election (or in Ford\\'s case election), not one was elected - and again, Trump\\'s numbers are significantly lower than theirs at this stage     /13 https://t.co/oPxOzT9NHA\\nAs for Bush - the only popular vote loser to be re-elected - some speculate that since the U.S. was fighting two wars in 2004, Americans were reluctant to switch horses in midstream. A debatable point—but the larger observation: popular vote losers usually aren\\'t re-elected  /17\\nIn the last three-quarters of a century, there have been four Presidents with low approval ratings who sought re-election (or in Ford\\'s case, election). What happened to them?    /12 https://t.co/MiaQzQ2cuW\\nWWR\\'s Paul Brandus has been doing a lot of public speaking this Fall. Stand by for a thread\\nDay 310: \\nPresident\\'s approval ranges from 36% to 43%\\nDisapproval: 54% to 59%        /5 https://t.co/HEzGeFqJcO\\nThat President Trump could be this low this early suggests (obviously) re-election challenges. Again: what does history tell us?     /11\\n10+ months: nearly a quarter of Trump’s term. How does he compare w/his prior dozen predecessors? And what does the past three-quarters of a century—the post-WWII era—suggest about where we could be headed? Based on a series of recent speeches by WWR’s Paul Brandus, a thread:\\nAt this stage - 10+ months in - Trump\\'s prior dozen predecessors had an average approval nearly 23 points higher than Trump (Gallup data). Their median approval: 58%     /10 https://t.co/dNJarOh3D2\\nThe President has now been in office for ten months. How does his overall RCP approval of 39.4% compare with his dozen most immediate predecessors at this stage? Truman through Obama?    /9\\nSometimes when WWR\\'s Paul Brandus mentions this history/data in speeches, someone who\\'s not hearing what they want to hear will call it “fake news.” The things mentioned above happened. They’re called facts. And \"facts,\" as John Adams used to say, \"are stubborn things\" /19\\nSince WWR said earlier that history can be useful — the prior data sets up a couple of observations about what COULD happen to Trump in 2020, and what his long--term legacy might be. So let’s go back in time—it’s very instructive:    /8\\nOf the other four Presidents who were also popular vote losers, only one - George W. Bush - won a second-term, and not by much: just 50.7% of the popular vote    /15 https://t.co/fvbWxWTjWO\\nPolls tell us much. If you’re like many people, you think some polls are better than others, particularly if they report data that validates what you’d like to believe. /2\\nPresident Trump says one poll, Rasmussen, has always been accurate and fair to him. So what does it tell us?     /7 https://t.co/wwe7qLRcFh\\nSo in two very important ways 1) extremely low poll numbers early and 2) the albatross of being a popular vote loser — history suggests President Trump is unlikely to win re-election. He certainly COULD win, of course, but the above two history lessons suggests otherwise   /18\\nAgain: this includes the polls that both sides like and both sides dislike. That seems like a reasonable approach. So the overall average is:     /6 https://t.co/Uze1aK3Tnf\\nSo perhaps a fair solution is to take all polls — all of them — and look at them together. The ones you like (but others may dislike) and vice-versa. /3\\nAll four Presidents who lost the popular vote came into office w/the knowledge that they had been rejected by the majority of Americans. They had no mandate; it made governing more difficult and accomplishments were (generally) few. This dynamic might sound familiar today   /16\\nWe\\'re not done with tonight\\'s history lesson. Trump is also the fifth President to win an election while losing the popular vote. So what happened to the other four popular vote losers ?    /14 https://t.co/h6bgSxJE0E\\nThat’s what Real Clear Politics does. They take all polls, put ‘em in a blender, hit puree —  and out comes the Real Clear Politics average. What does it tell us today?  /4\\n.@CSPAN back in January released a survey of historians.

We\\'re not taking Lincoln here  /21 https://t.co/A8bjyBOOoD\\nSpeaking of history — the other four men who lost the popular vote — who came into office with that electoral stigma — here’s another question: What is their historical legacy today?

The purism of the further left side of progressives in this country will not help us get there, and neither will capitulating to the point of meaningless, symbolic legislation. 9/\\nThe legal basis of the existence of these groups is essentially that in representing a group of individuals the rights of those individuals are given to the group. I\\'m not a lawyer, but that\\'s how I read it. Creating Super PACs is incredibly simple: https://t.co/qFcoShriyH /11\\nRedrawing district lines is done following the census, which is done every ten years.

Almost every intellectually honest American wanted a law passed, but the NRA had the trump card: They paid for last years election, and they will pay for next years election, for our legislators. Voters don\\'t. /17\\nWhen Bernie said we have to \"Get the money out of politics!\" he wasn\\'t wrong, but he was being simplistic. It\\'s NOT a simple issue. A constitutional amendment has to go through a nearly impossible process to be ratified: https://t.co/jW1mH9LHXI 7/\\nGerrymandering is clear in it\\'s impacts. Congresspeople rarely have to actually run to win their seat because the districts have been designed to keep them from having to. That leaves a few dozen seats, out of 435 seats, which are competitive every cycle. 2/\\nThis has led to a democracy that is, in no small sense, breaking down in its promise to be representative of the interests of the voting public. It IS still representative, but of the interests that can afford to pay for increasingly expensive elections. /19\\nThese groups have been a critical part of our politics since well before I studied political science in college (been a while 🙃), but even then the NRA and AIPAC were among the most powerful forces in American politics. Then with Citizens United we added fuel to the fire. /12\\nThe GOP tax bill is yet another symptom of the break between voters in our democracy, and policy outcomes in our government.

With unlimited money, unlimited leverage. /14\\nWhile PACs were already incredibly important, Citizens United increased the scale to essentially limitless amounts of money. Following that decision, there was an explosion in the 501(c)(4) organizations that underpinned Super PAC system. See: https://t.co/7CAT00JeFa /13\\nLet me touch a bit on the system of funneling money into the political system, because I don\\'t think I explained that clearly. Essentially we have a maze of legal structures through which money can enter the political sphere, and the tax bill actually creates MORE. /10\\nWe have to think in decades. We need to think in districts. We need to be running for office at every level (https://t.co/el6ikttQ7s). We need to build a bench of leaders that will be the next generation spearheading the change we need. That\\'s how you #resist. &lt;/endRant&gt;\\nThat is why you see a legislative branch that, increasingly, can get literally nothing done outside of the naming of a post office. Anything controversial can not only drive away a primary source of funding, but drive that into the pockets an opposition candidate. /15\\nThere are some good guys in the Super PAC space, Joe Biden started one recently, and great causes like the AARP represent a purer example for how this system was supposed to work.

The CA is about fairness and it is only fair if we level the playing field. JTL will enjoy low operational costs being a Tier 2offering Tier 1 services.\\nWHAT IS NOT BEING SAID ABOUT THE 700MHZ?\\nIt can only operate optimally with 3 commercial operators. Found to be the case in USA where only Verizon and AT&amp;T commercially operate using the band (each has 2 x10 MHz of spectrum) and the Philippines  Many will want argue with this.\\nTo that effect, CA has already allocated spectrum to JTL and KCA. (using it for  ADS-B) This technically means that only one more commercial operator can be licensed for optimum operations. Unless CA becomes glutton for the 2.5B. Btw they stole our internship money!\\nFeel free to RT, chip in, ask questions, correct, add info or share your opinion.\\nWHAT IS MY OPINION?\\nBeing a finite national resource, @CA_Kenya should have put aside a portion of the spectrum and reserved it for testing purposes ONLY and made it available to everyone (media, schools, manufacturers etc.) then allocated the rest through a bidding process.\\n@CA_Kenya @FaibaJTL The CA even asked @SafaricomLtd to facilitate inter-connection agreements with JTL to enable end to end origination and termination of communication traffic between its networks and  all national and international destinations.\\nRemember that the  700MHz performs better in rural areas? That there is the whole motive. Business! More than 90% of new data consumers by 2020 will come from rural areas. That\\'s why coverage in rural areas is key. The 700 MHz band is perfectly suited for this situation.\\nJTL has rolled out LTE services in Kenya. But there is something fishy and irregular about the whole deal.

Big players like Qualcomm are still sitting on the fence.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE 700 MHZ (TECHNICAL)\\n-It is the spectrum portion from 695MHz to about 805MHz (IEEE) \\n- Lies within the UHF range of radio frequencies above VHF and below SHF\\n- has a wide channel size. In our case 2 blocks of 45MHz of contiguous spectrum\\n@CA_Kenya CA awarded @faibaJTL  a trial license for 100k and restricted them to 5 major towns (other telcos didn’t get that much coverage during their 4G trials). These are the highest grossing towns in terms of data revenue. Everything you need to be profitable\\nWhy Are Other Telecos Bitter?\\n@SafaricomLtd: Eyed 4G spectrum as early as 2010, Licensed to try the 4G spectrum in 2013, initially given the entire 800MHz spectrum (second lucrative) then forced to share with Airtel and Telkom, paid 2.5B for their 4G license\\n@CA_Kenya @CA_Kenya switched off Analogue TV completely, releasing the 700MHz Spectrum. CA promised to prioritize small operators to test the network but said it would use competitive bidding process to allocate commercial license. It is now clearly not willing to auction the  spectrum\\nI am about to write a very long thread on the 700Mhz, how JTL got it, Role of CA in the confusion and my opinions on everything. It will be a bit technical but i am open to  explain in layman  to anyone who will find it difficult to understand.\\nWHAT ROLE HAS @CA_Kenya PLAYED IN THE STALEMATE?\\n-CA initially allocate the  entire 800MHz to Safaricom, they were challenged in court and later divided the block into 3 blocks and gave them to the 3 major Tier 1 Telcos locking out any other future telcos including @FaibaJTL.\\n@SafaricomLtd @AIRTEL_KE : Allocated trial spectrum in 2015, prioritized 4G over 3G in a bid to penetrate the data market, has struggled to have coverage in at least 1000 BS, paid 2.5B for their 4G license earlier this year, feel they need to be protected against @SafaricomLtd ’s \"monopoly\"\\nBut first, why is there a big buzz about this 700MHz spectrum?\\n1.JTL paid only 100k for the license\\n2.It is efficient, has wider coverage and more penetration in buildings\\n3. The Band’s technical characteristics to support better coverage in rural areas (This is very key)\\n@CA_Kenya CA should have prioritized media houses in the allocation of the spectrum since they were the initial users and ‘owners’ of the spectrum. But prolly no media house  came forward to request allocation. What a shame, their live news coverage would have changed forever.\\n@CA_Kenya @FaibaJTL @SafaricomLtd One starts to wonder why JTL has gotten such a lucrative deal. Is JTL owned by the govt? Why is the govt doing all this to promote a private carrier competing  directly with public  carriers? Isn\\'t this the deal we could have given @TelkomKenya to save it from its woes?\\nAll said and done, I think Only @SafaricomLtd can fully exploit the capabilities of the 700MHz spectrum.

His deal with Putin had to have been struck pre-campaign—with no prior plan for a backchannel. So Trump had to seek one.\\n@ScottMStedman 16/ Look at it this way: you don\\'t announce via Russian media that a real estate deal is dead unless it was *clearly or ambiguously alive* prior to that. Agalarov\\'s announcement his Trump Tower Moscow deal only died in February of 2017 is—all by itself—*profoundly* incriminating.\\n@ScottMStedman 9/ The message to Trump was clear: continue to be the presidential candidate we want to see, and I\\'ll continue to bless the deal I helped set up in 2013. But don\\'t contact me directly. Use backchannels. Which Trump then sought to do via Flynn, Papadopoulos, Page, Kushner, Prince.\\nSchiller testified under oath that a man in this room (but not Emin) offered to purchase prostitutes for Trump for the night this photo was taken (11/9/13). The only person who fits the description Schiller gave is this man, Artem Klyushin—whose pal runs Moscow\\'s largest brothel. https://t.co/zIfguywm9V\\n@ScottMStedman 12/ The evidence suggests Trump *didn\\'t* have a ready backchannel to Putin during the campaign—that\\'s why he kept trying new intermediaries to get one (Papadopoulos, Page, Kushner, Manafort, Flynn, Prince, Cohen). This suggests an *earlier* deal Trump needed to know was still on.\\n4/ Whatever the people in this picture are looking at—Putin\\'s face or Trump Tower Moscow plans associated with a deal orchestrated by 6 Kremlin agents (Emin Agalarov, Aras Agalarov, Klyushin, Alferova, Gref, and Kozhin) and signed by Trump 11/9/13 by Emin\\'s admission—this is bad.\\n@ScottMStedman PS4/ The full list—I believe—of intermediaries Trump attempted to use to get to Putin and/or Kremlin agents during the campaign:\\n\\nAgalarov (Aras)\\nAgalarov (Emin)\\nCohen\\nFlynn\\nKushner\\nManafort\\nPage\\nPapadopoulos\\nPrince\\nSater\\nTrump Jr.\\n\\nThe number suggests both futility *and* intent.\\n@ScottMStedman 19/ It\\'s possible Rykov and the Kremlin, as propagandists, understand that the *most* damage Russia can deal America is to put us in a state in which we simultaneously suspect—but don\\'t know for *certain*—that our president is compromised. So the truth must be mixed with fiction.\\n@ScottMStedman PS3/ Just since I began this thread, *another 25* of my Twitter followers have written in to say Klyushin just followed them on Twitter also. \\n\\nStrange behavior, wouldn\\'t you say?\\n@ScottMStedman PS/ I hate to say it, but—as someone who worked in the CJS—I have to note that the KARA plot is *neither* salacious *nor* sensational. In fact, it\\'s the opposite: it\\'s *extremely* banal. Predictable. A little sex, a little lying, a little videotape. This is run-of-the-mill crime.\\n2/ That pal, Kremlin agent Konstantin Rykov, confessed in November 2016 to being part of a plot to help elect Trump.

When he ended it, he blamed Trump—saying not that Trump was POTUS, but Trump \"couldn\\'t do deals.\"\\n@ScottMStedman 20/ The KARA plot (Klyushin, Agalarov, Rykov, Alferova) checks out—it\\'s a key part of what\\'s true. The \"fiction\" is spread by bots and undercover right-wingers like Louise Mensch—who tell us Donald Trump trafficked in underage human slaves and there\\'s video of him raping several.\\n@ScottMStedman 15/ That Aras Agalarov signed a letter-of-intent in November 2013, then waited *well over 3 years* to declare the deal dead—doing so just *2 weeks* after Trump\\'s inauguration, *right* when Flynn got caught—is another incriminating fact. He wanted Trump to believe the deal was on.\\n3/ Trump said he spoke with Putin 11/9/13 in a way both \"direct and indirect\"—consistent with pal Tom Arnold saying \"speakerphone.\" Is that what we see in this photo? It\\'s either *that* or a Trump Tower Moscow deal with Kremlin agents—3 of whom are in the room. One or the other. https://t.co/JGSHcprjBw\\n@ScottMStedman 14/ A major incriminating fact is that Trump *confessed* to keeping in contact with Emin and his dad *after* Emin says they signed a letter-of-intent—which means Trump had every reason to this his 2013 Putin-brokered Trump Tower Moscow deal was *still active* during the campaign.\\n@ScottMStedman 18/ So I\\'ll concede I don\\'t know exactly what to do with Rykov\\'s confession, except to say a) it checks out (because of his premature Trump support, apparent provision of prostitutes in 2013, and foreknowledge of otherwise classified facts), and b) he was authorized to disclose.\\n@ScottMStedman 11/ So if Trump Tower Moscow is dead, but Trump keeps performing like a trained seal for Putin, one of two things is true: he has assurances the deal can be revived or Putin was using the Trump Tower Moscow deal to get kompromat—which witnesses say he got via Rykov\\'s prostitutes.\\n6/ When I first started writing about Kremlin agent Klyushin a week ago—extending earlier work done by Democratic Underground and @ScottMStedman—Klyushin began following me on Twitter. \\n\\nHe also followed at least 50 people who commented on my work—as I\\'ve heard from 50 saying so.\\n5/ What we know is that Alferova and Emin Agalarov—both pictured here—came out of this meeting (a) knowing Trump would run for president, though no one in America knew (as Trump wouldn\\'t announce it for 18+ more months), and (b) sure Putin had blessed the Trump Tower Moscow deal.\\n@ScottMStedman PS2/ What Russia and Trump supporters are doing now is—via bots and trolls—trying to convince everyone how \"out there\" the Trump conspiracy journalists are describing is. \\n\\nBut it\\'s *exactly* the opposite: it\\'s *pathetically* unimaginative and stupid. These are *basic* criminals.\\n@ScottMStedman PS5/ Klyushin/Rykov tweets/FB posts from *March \\'16*—before anyone in the U.S. knew of a Russian plot, and before anyone in Russia knew such a plot would be discovered—speak of \"secret meetings\" and finding ways to \"help Trump.\" So no one can say Rykov pig-piled on a known story.',\n",
       " '#11 LEVELING NEW ACCUSATIONS OF IDENTICAL CONDUCT. Criminals accused of, say, assault will often level new claims (even unrelated ones) that someone else is guilty of assault. Trump regularly accuses people of the lying, cover-ups, and treasonous conduct he stands accused of now.\\n#4 TAMPER WITH WITNESSES. Criminals will often seek contact with known witnesses either to convince them not to testify, to change their story, to remain loyal to the defendant, or to intimidate them. Trump did this with Flynn, Yates, Comey, McCabe, Sessions, his son, and others.\\n#19 SEEK DODGY ALLIES AND PARALLEL INVESTIGATIONS. Criminals recruit dodgy witnesses or pursue suspect lines of inquiry to evade probes whose just administration they know will catch them. Trump uses House allies, Fox News, and dodgy pals to build a wall of allies around himself.\\n#20 UNDERSCORE SUPPORTERS\\' AFFECTION. Criminals hope that, if they don\\'t have the facts on their side, they can at least get others to say they\\'re a good person. Trump pumps up supporters\\' adulation, praise, and encouragement at every turn to transform popularity into innocence.\\n#10 EXHIBIT UNUSUAL AGITATION. Criminals exhibit anger in response to warranted criminal accusations; in my own experience, innocent people react to false accusations with signs of confusion, fear, and depression. Trump has responded to Mueller with rage and false self-assurance.\\n#18 PLAY WITH LANGUAGE. Criminals know statutes are well-defined, so they get cute with language to seek out wiggle room in their criminal liability. Trump uses word games, misquotations, false definitions, and linguistic misdirection to undercut precise legal terms and concepts.\\n(NOTE) The above applies only to the 5% of arrested individuals who a) did exactly what they were accused of, and b) refuse to admit what they did and then seek a just punishment via plea. Trump is in the tiny minority of criminals who won\\'t take responsibility for their actions.\\n#17 TRUST ONLY FAMILY. Criminals, especially those who\\'ve participated in a conspiracy, necessarily operate within a small circle of trust. Trump has surrounded his business dealings with family members and attorneys to make it unlikely or impossible that anyone will rat him out.\\n#8 USE \"EVEN IF\" ARGUMENTS. Criminals often float self-aggrandizing hypotheticals in the form of bet-hedging: \"Even if I did X, it wouldn\\'t be illegal, or I would\\'ve been justified...\" Trump does this most flagrantly when discussing whether he told Flynn to negotiate with Russia.\\n#9 PLAY DUMB. Criminals will claim to have no knowledge of things they obviously would have known about. Trump claims to have known absolutely nothing any of his aides (even his own sons) were doing with the Russians, a claim that strains credulity well past the breaking point.\\n#16 DRAW OTHERS INTO THEIR COVER-UP. Criminals are so focused on their own survival that they needlessly draw innocents into their schemes for self-salvation. Trump uses others (including attorneys, spokespeople, aides, and family members) to spread lies about his Russian ties.\\n#3 COMPLAIN ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT. Criminals want to talk about the investigation itself, rather than what and who the investigation is investigating. Trump obsessively complains about aspects of the investigation against him that don\\'t actually change the underlying evidence.\\n#5 DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THEIR ACTIONS. Criminals eagerly discuss subjects beyond their pending case when doing so distracts from their criminal liability. Trump\\'s war on \"fake news\" and unhinged tweetstorms distract attention from an investigation threatening to take him down.\\n#7 EXHIBIT FALSE CONFIDENCE. Criminals often assure allies and defenders that there\\'s nothing to be found against them and they\\'ll shortly be exonerated, even when nothing in the facts supports this view. Trump\\'s wild claims that he\\'ll soon be exonerated fall into this category.\\n#6 REFUSE TO ANSWER VALID QUESTIONS. Criminals refuse to discuss, sometimes even with a lawyer, inculpatory facts, whether things they said, decisions they made, or actions they took. Trump has successfully evaded answering even the most basic questions on what he knew and when.\\n#14 DENY SIMILAR PAST CONDUCT. Even though criminal defense attorneys have access to clients\\' criminal records, criminals often attempt to downplay or deny their criminal pasts. Trump has denied provable and known frauds, perjuries, and clandestine foreign contacts from his past.\\n(THANKS) Many thanks to the excellent David Swerdlick of The Washington Post, who encouraged me to flesh out and publish this analysis, and who saw an early draft of it. And thanks to the *many* criminal defense attorneys I spoke with over the months while preparing this summary.\\n#2 ALLEGE A CONSPIRACY. Criminals will claim a conspiracy as the cause of their problems. The most common conspiracy alleged is between witnesses or members of law enforcement. Trump repeatedly alleges that government officials and law enforcement officers conspired against him.\\n(BONUS) DENY KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS. Criminals deny knowing people they believe they can credibly deny knowing, if knowing them would be inculpatory. Trump has done this with Papadopoulos, Sater, Page and many others who he definitely knows but who he fears Mueller has linked to him.\\n#1 DEFLECT BLAME. Criminals seek others who may have conducted themselves poorly in order to unload or distribute blame rightly assigned to them. Trump does this with ex-aides like Manafort, Flynn, and Papadopoulos, who he presents as little known by him and/or having gone rogue.\\n#13 AVOID GIVING EVIDENCE UNDER OATH. Criminals are smart enough to know that they must never be placed under oath on the subject of their crimes. Trump, despite saying in the Rose Garden that he\\'d speak to Mueller under oath, has thus far refused to make good on that assurance.\\n(THREAD) 20 Things Guilty People Do That Trump Does Daily\\n\\nAs a former criminal defense attorney, I\\'ve sat in rooms candidly discussing crime with thousands of criminals. I know what \"consciousness of guilt\" looks like. Trump exhibits it daily.\\n\\nI hope you\\'ll read and share this. https://t.co/JWBU3ONduK\\n#15 TELL UNNECESSARY, GRANDIOSE LIES. Criminals lie out of fear; they tell grandiose lies out of a false belief they can orchestrate their exoneration. Trump\\'s lies about how he conducted himself at the Ritz Moscow in 2013 (grandiose and quickly disproven) are an example of this.\\n#12 OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE. Criminals will try to slow the investigation against them, including by refusing to speak or delaying speaking to investigators. Trump not only won\\'t speak to investigators, he\\'s tried to fire, get reassigned, or force into retirement those investigators.',\n",

This is not about pointing fingers, this is about illustrating how easy some CI techniques are to execute.\\nAt this time, the head of CIA's CI, James Jesus Angleton, was slipping further and further into a spiral of paranoia, jumping at shadows and seeing enemies at every turn, even within the CIA. And the CIA itself became involved in Contras and Coups. https://t.co/ffmow7vWYC\\nPretend I am a bright Stalin-era Soviet CI agent, and I wish to sharpen contradictions in the US. I would recruit a US Congressman, then have him found an anti-Communist committee. This committee would investigate both real communists and innocents.\\nFor example: If wished to divide HRC supporters from Bernie supporters, I would pose as a Berner, then relentlessly attack HRC supporters as being weak-minded and corporatist. This agitates #WithHer folks not just against me, but against what I claim to represent. https://t.co/byayrNEdY6\\nWe had a government with more holes than a seive, racist attacks on civil rights, war in Vietnam, paranoid, traitorous and corrupt leaders, JFK and RFK assassinated, specter of nuclear war, CI attacks against democracy. . . and we still won.\\nThe Dickstein case is arguably the most successful CI operation of the Cold War.

       " 'This urge is not always a negative force - sometimes systems do need disruption to get them out of established patterns that no longer serve. Sometimes the timing makes sense.\\nWhat I’ve been thinking about lately is this: even when we end up with the same system, WE are changed. \\n\\nWe worked through the problems ourselves &amp; figured out the details and muttered to ourselves a bunch, “OH, that’s why that was there.”\\nMaybe it’s not a failure at all. Maybe this is how groups of humans work. But all this burning of old systems has a lot of downsides.\\nIs there a term for the human propensity to seek “silver bullet” solutions (or look for a savior) rather than improving what exists?\\nThis is what’s in play every time we vote in an outsider (then are surprised how long it takes them to ramp up), or “reinvent money” (without understanding the complex system already in use), or rewrite a whole codebase (rather than figuring out the one we have).\\nSo: am I too conservative with software systems? Should I burn it down more often?\\n\\nAm I not conservative enough elsewhere? Should I be working harder to figure out how things got the way they are, and what needs they serve?\\nIs this a communication failure? A documentation failure? Or is there something about humans that means we need to do it ourselves to be sure? And if so, ...is that an empathy failure?\\n2. In other worlds, where I don’t have as much experience understanding their systems, I still tend towards “burn it down” over “understand it better.”\\nBut the more times I see this pattern play out - in software systems, political systems, community systems - it seems like 99 times out of 100, when we burn it down &amp; rebuild...we end up rebuilding the same system.\\nI’ve been thinking about this for two reasons. \\n\\n1. In the software world, over the course of 20 years working on these systems, I’ve gone from “this is terrible! rewrite it all” to “I don’t see why this needs to be here, so I must not fully understand the problem.”\\nI used to be annoyed by the people who were constantly proposing major changes. \\n\\nLet’s do it over in react native!\\nLet’s convert our database to neo4j!\\nLet’s try a new auth library!\\nLet’s install the new package manager! https://t.co/2ZTNFODRYQ\\nIt’s a good start to be aware of your bias, but you won’t change it without explicitly seeking out counterparts. \\n\\nSo in software, I need to work with the burners. In worlds where my bias is more burn-y, I need to work with the conservers.\\nIt felt like they were constantly questioning my choices - like behind each question was a judgemental “why isn’t it already this way?”\\nI realized recently, though, that these aren’t the right questions.\\n\\nMore experience understanding, changing, and replacing software systems does mean that I have a more visceral sense of the high cost of a replace, AND that I find understanding &amp; changing-in-place less daunting.\\nBut there are still situations in which a rewrite or replacement is a good idea. I may miss those.\\n\\nI know where my bias is. I don’t need to overthink it though; I just need to make sure I have folks on my team who have the _opposite_ bias.\\nWhat’s the worst that could happen if you *always* engaged constructively with someone proposing something, even if it is OBVIOUSLY WRONG and A WASTE OF TIME TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT?\\nI need to work with the burn-it-down folks. And they need to work with me. \\n\\nWe need to illuminate our respective blind spots in our search for the best solution.\\nBut a year or two later the choice came up again, and this time we did take it - partially because the previous time had forced me to enumerate all of postgres’s advantages. \\n\\nWhich meant I could see when they started to wear thin.\\nThe only way to even start to counteract bias is to combine forces with someone whose brain goes the other way.\\nIt’s never a waste of time for people to feel heard. And it’s never a waste of time to re-articulate your goals &amp; see if your tech choices are meeting them.\\n\\nYou might learn something surprising.\\nBias, whether it comes from your work experience or from racial privilege, can’t be overcome with more thinking. \\n\\nIt’s literally the structure of your brain connections that’s the issue.\\nBut those questions are gifts. \\n\\nI’d never thought about using a graph database, but talking about neo4j on one project really helped me crystallize what benefits we were getting from postgres. \\n\\n(We stayed on postgres.)',\n",

At each step in the process you have to be prepared for the Alinsky-trained opposition to say: \"prove it\"! https://t.co/5JH0nkw7Yp\\n6.  As soon as that opponent cannot \"prove\" that specific claim, then all subsequent downstream claims are dismissed through the use of the previous public down-dressing.\\n7. David Axelrod or Lanny Davis (or their VJ crew) would like nothing more than to see a highly visible figure make a claim right now that President Obama instructed political surveillance upon Donald Trump through the FBI and DOJ.\\n20.  Nunes - Swamp Draining via FISA-702 Abuse. https://t.co/AIbDM1lk5X\\n11.  If they are successful at getting a public entity, visibly on record, publicly making an accusation they cannot yet immediately prove - Axelrod, Davis, Brock, then flood the media cycle with use of that single example to diminish all else.\\n10.  If they can bait a well known public official, or a generally well known representative of oppositional media, into that position -TALKING BEYOND PROVABLE EVIDENCE-... they will.\\n13.  Additionally, the same use of NSA surveillance didn\\'t just start with Donald Trump. It\\'s been going on for a lot longer.  Even the FISC publicly acknowledged a pattern period from 2012 through 2016 that was deeply concerning.\\n22.  Goodlatte - Swamp Draining via DOJ oversight - using DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz investigation. https://t.co/GO1cQbYrnK\\n2. One of the better known strategies by the Axelrod generation, when they know they have been caught on severely damaging information, is to bait their political opposition into going too far.\\n16.

So before a *kitchen cabinet* of White Hat-minded swamp drainers could even begin to confront the corruption and conspiracy, they would first need to identify people within their own team who were likely compromised.\\n4.

       " '19/ The best way to get your content shared is through reciprocity. RT people who RT you. I\\'m in a ton of DM groups where we all RT each other\\'s content. Think about forming a few of those. Usually if you want someone to RT something specific all you have to do is ask.\\n3/ I use Twitter Moments to preserve threads. I used to use Tweetdeck but this is a lot easier. Sometimes I don\\'t even publish them - they require a photo - because I can grab the top tweet straight from the draft when I need it.\\n1/ Thread about useful Twitter Tools and Tips from @SallyAlbright and @CapWaterfront - Please retweet.\\n15/ Never automate anything, not Likes, not RTs, especially not Follows. They will know, they always know, and you will lose your account forever. It\\'s okay to schedule your own stuff but automation is verboten. If I did half the stuff they say I did, I\\'d be long gone.\\n18/ So the response from Twitter was basically \"Automation is against our TOS and since you have admitted to using automation this account is permanently closed.\" They played us. Pretty hilarious imo. And that was that. It was his company name.\\n7/ @Tweepi also does a lot of useful analytics. It shows you what dormant accounts you follow so you can unfollow them. It\\'s great for adding people to lists - one of the few tools out there to manage lists that actually works well.\\n5/ @Buffer is a great tool for scheduling tweets. There are tons of apps that let you post to multiple platforms but with Buffer the posts don\\'t go out at the same time. You can also schedule tweets at optimum times based on your when your followers are online.\\n14/ Don\\'t buy followers. They don\\'t interact with you and it\\'s obvious they\\'re fake. Bernie\\'s Women\\'s Conference had to buy followers to cover the fact that they lost so many real ones. Not a TERRIBLE idea, PR wise, but it was easy to spot.\\n4/ If you want to see an entire thread, or see which tweet or which user someone is replying to, click the time stamp. This works in Facebook too. Here\\'s another tip: https://t.co/tiAySQd5p5\\n9/ @Favstar shows you your most popular tweets. @IFTTT (If This Then That, rhymes with gift) does a lot of automation but doesn\\'t do much for twitter beyond putting people on lists and emailing you digests but it\\'s worth checking out.\\n2/ Starting with threads, @WriteRack is essential. You can compose in the program or copy and paste your essay. It formats your text into a thread of tweets then you clean them up so the breaks are where you want them. Then you set them to go out on a timer.\\n6/ @Tweepi is great for new accounts. You identify accounts similar to yours and follow who follows them. So it\\'s people with the same interests who are more likely to follow back. It doesn\\'t happen that fast, and it\\'s tedious, but reading bios can be kind of fun.\\n22/ So there you go. Nothing black hat or automated or \"fake\" about any of it. Please let me know if you have any questions.\\n12/ There\\'s no need to thank people for RTs, Likes &amp; Follows. You can, but there\\'s no need. You definitely do not need to be paying for this service. On the other hand, thanking people for their CONTENT is always appreciated and encouraged.\\n16/ I had a client once, in 2010 when things were still kinda new. He bought a service called TweetAttacks that would follow people for you. I told him not to use it, he did it anyway, called like 2 days later, he\\'d been banned. Here\\'s where the story gets good.\\n23/ Two more things. When you have someone muted but want to see their side of a conversation, follow them, then unfollow to mute them again when you\\'re finished.\\n\\nAlso @Favstar shows you who interacts with you the most so you can reciprocate.\\n10/ OK they make fun of me for this, I guess it\\'s \"out of style\" but so what. Chrome ext. @Klout puts a little number next to someone\\'s handle to show what kind of engagement &amp; authority their acct has. Anything under 40 is likely a bot or brand new acct. A lifesaver.\\n21/ We tell everyone, leave your own tweets at the top when you log off. Not just your pinned tweet, your current stuff. I usually hit the top two in my mentions. This is free advertising. Even if it\\'s just you, why not put your best face forward?\\n11/ A lot of people don\\'t know Twitter has a robust advanced search feature. It\\'s annoying that it only searches the exact spelling not plurals etc, but it searches a lot of different ways. This is how the Berners are so good at finding our old tweets. https://t.co/2bxaqzgdqk\\n8/ @Roundteam - This is how you keep accounts from going dormant or keep a presence if you aren\\'t on Twitter much. You can set it RT tweets with keywords or tweets from people on a list- that\\'s what I usually do. It will RT at intervals you set up.\\n20/ Apparently \"Please retweet\" gets more shares than \"Please RT\" and posts with photos get exponentially more shares. I\\'m told 3 hashtags is the sweet spot for the most shares but I have no idea why, just passing it along.\\n17/ So I go into the account and file an appeal. After some back and forth, Twitter says, Fine, type this sentence and send it to us. So I typed \"I [person\\'s name] confess that I used automation on X and I understand it is against Twitter\\'s TOS\"\\n13/ Don\\'t use auto DMs for new followers. No judgement, I know everyone does it, but don\\'t. Exception: Events. I\\'ve seen it work for getting details &amp; updates out about your event. I\\'ve seen bars reply \"Thanks for following! Text this number for a free beer.\" I approve.',\n",

       " '3/ If impeachment proceedings are initiated against Trump, the earliest that could happen (given political realities) is in Spring 2019, and of course it would almost certainly require the Democrats winning the House in the mid-term elections (which they\\'re not assured of doing).\\n15/ Today, media and some pundits who haven\\'t followed the Trump-Russia case closely gave Team Trump an *amazing* news cycle by wrongly stating that Mueller\\'s decision regarding Papadopoulos\\' sentencing means either Papadopoulos was a dud or Mueller is almost done with his work.\\n14/ We have *no idea* what indictments may issue from the 15 months of assistance—well over a year—Papadopoulos will have given Mueller by the earliest date of his sentencing. By October 2018, we may have seen indictments of Clovis, Don Jr., Kushner, Stone, and other Trump aides.\\n5/ So when media and some legal pundits blithely talk of Mueller \"calling Papadopoulos at a trial,\" I don\\'t know what trial they\\'re thinking of, as if it\\'s a criminal trial, it can\\'t happen until 2022 or 2026 *at the earliest*—and if a political trial, there may be no witnesses.\\n8/ There simply was never any real chance a federal judge would wait until 2022 or 2023 (or 2027 or 2028!) to sentence Papadopoulos (on some benighted theory that Papadopoulos must not and cannot be allowed to plead to a single criminal information until the Trump case is over).\\n11/ Those who imply 15 months of cooperation from a witness who, for timeframe reasons, realistically *has* to be sentenced *before* the trial at which he\\'ll testify—because this case involves the president—means that Papadopoulos \"didn\\'t have the goods\" have *got* to be kidding.\\n9/ And because impeachment is a political process, it has nothing to do with Mueller\\'s calculations. So there was just *no reason* for Mueller to wait on Papadopoulos\\' sentencing once he had all the testimony, debriefings, and (possibly) wiretaps from Papadopoulos that he wanted.\\n7/ So those who imagine that Mueller is making a grand statement—in agreeing to hold a status hearing on a pre-sentencing report in late June, which would set Papadopoulos up for a September or October 2018 plea *unless the parties agreed to bump it* (which they could)—are wrong.\\nSOURCE/ Hopefully it\\'s now clear what The Washington Post (below) and certain online legal pundits got right—and also wrong—about today\\'s Mueller-Papadopoulos news. https://t.co/RAt4eNWxIp\\n17/ I\\'m not going to unpack in detail all the investigative areas Papadopoulos\\' assistance necessarily touches on—including contacts in Israel, Greece, England, the United States, and Italy, as well as substantial events involving Egypt and, of course, Moscow—but they\\'re legion.\\n6/ During the Clinton impeachment, the party defending the president—then the Democrats—wanted no witnesses. The Republicans wanted witnesses, but recognized that they would be limited. Papadopoulos, key as he is, likely wouldn\\'t make the top of Democrats\\' witness-list wish-list.\\n(THREAD) There\\'s been some very good—and also very bad—analysis on Twitter today about the upcoming Papadopoulos sentencing. This thread separates the wheat from the chaff—and in so doing aims to calm fears Papadopoulos \"didn\\'t pan out\" as a witness. I hope you\\'ll read and share. https://t.co/1Kde9D8O7P\\n13/ And as I noted earlier today, there are many other ways prosecutors can maintain leverage over defendants post-conviction: probation, suspended sentences, deferred sentences, sentencing conditions, or even agreements between the parties that occur adjacent to the sentencing.\\nPS/ Tweet #14 wasn\\'t an *exhaustive* list of indictments that could—I merely say \"could\"—come by October 2018.

Historically there have been disputes over whether a Senate trial should have witnesses—as it\\'s a political trial, rather than a proper trial. Even when witnesses are called, few are called.\\n10/ And let\\'s be very clear here: George Papadopoulos has been giving Mueller *whatever information he wanted* since *July 2017*—so unless Mueller decides he wants to bump it (which he may well do), Papadopoulos\\' sentencing will come after *15 months* of Papadopoulos cooperating.\\n19/ Those future indictments *will* occur in part because of Papadopoulos\\' 15 months of cooperation with investigators, and Papadopoulos *will* be called to testify against Trump sometime between 2022 and 2028—should the president\\'s health ensure him a lifespan of 76 to 82 years.\\n2/ Trump\\'s presidency (assuming no impeachment) will last until either January of 2021 or January of 2025, meaning that (if there is no impeachment) Robert Mueller wouldn\\'t expect to be able to take any case against Trump to trial until 2022 or 2026 *at the very, very earliest*.\\n20/ Here\\'s what media must stop doing: taking fairly slow news days and trying to make them sensational. \\n\\nAnd here\\'s what lawyers who don\\'t know the Trump-Russia case well should start doing: research. \\n\\nUntil those things happen, we\\'ll get uneven analyses, as we did today. /end\\n18/ I\\'ll say this as clearly as I can: Mueller\\'s probe will go into 2019, as it\\'s only widening (and we\\'ve already been told so by Mueller\\'s team); Papadopoulos is a key witness (because that\\'s blindingly obvious for anyone following the case); and we *will* see more indictments.\\n1/ The overwhelming majority of criminal attorneys agree that—even if Mueller were to decide he can *indict* a sitting president—he cannot put the president *on trial* for that indictment until after an impeachment proceeding or (as the case may be) after Trump\\'s full presidency.\\n12/ Moreover—as Alex Whiting of Harvard Law School notes—because Papadopoulos almost certainly has already testified before a grand jury, he\\'s already *locked into* the testimony Mueller wants from him (as if he changes it down the line, he can expect to be charged with perjury).\\n16/ Anyone—anyone—who has closely followed the Trump-Russia case over the last year knows that Papadopoulos, as one of the very earliest members of Trump\\'s NatSec team (and entrusted, contra what Trump says, with great responsibility) can help Mueller on many aspects of his case.',\n",

Focus on Hillary Clinton ---&gt; Racketeering, money laundering, tax evasion &amp; maybe insider trading.\\n17) BTW Kazakhstan is on the border of Russia. Like I just said Uranium One owns huge mines in Kazakhstan. I\\'m sure there\\'s no problem for Uranium One to ship uranium from their mines in Kazakhstan to refineries Russia. None whatsoever.... https://t.co/h5KeCQFrAE\\n5) Now the approval of the license for U1 was conditional on there being no shipments of uranium outside the US without approval.

He\\'d insist Rosatom secretly ship the uranium in from the little mine on the other side of the world in Wyoming instead.\\n9) Same to assume the stockpile is mainly for nuclear power plants in cases of an energy crisis. This would be enriched uranium. It\\'s not what the U1 facilities produce. If it would be for military use would also be enriched uranium &amp; possibly some depleted uranium.\\n3) We\\'re in no danger of running out of uranium plenty of other companies doing the same thing in the US. Plenty of reserves available in the US for our need. We also have our friend to the north Canada with more than enough to fulfill our needs.\\n19) I\\'m sure Putin would love for Rosatom to lose one of their facility licenses, he\\'d find it fun to risk future work for Rosatom &amp; their employees getting arrested. Yes I\\'m sure he\\'d love an international crisis. 🙄\\n20) Putin could care less about Rosatom aims to start building Turkish nuclear plants.

       " 'NOTE/ There are other ancillary effects to this story: for instance, Bill Burck *must* now see that he needs to get the hell off two of the three cases he\\'s currently working as attorney: Bannon, McGahn, and Priebus. Representing all three is no longer (really never was) tenable.\\n15/ Rather, the NYT says that—either on his own counsel or someone else\\'s—Donald Trump *ordered* McGahn to do something. He did *not* ask for his advice, he *ordered* him to fire Mueller. (It may have been Kasowitz\\'s doing, as Kasowitz was urging Trump to go to war with Mueller.)\\n5/ It\\'s an impeachable offense because it already was for Bill Clinton—per the Republican Party and its votes on impeachment in the House. So while Trump may only have had an inkling of this last June, he likely knew enough to see that McGahn was someone whose loyalty he needed.\\n(THREAD) BREAKING NEWS (New York Times): We now know Trump already tried to fire Special Counsel Mueller—7 months ago. Many believed such an attempt would be a \"red line\" that would lead to impeachment. So what do we do now? I analyze that question and what this news means here. https://t.co/Hfde88FH4e\\nCONCLUSION/ This is the last moment for Republicans to jump off the Trump ship in the eyes of history. Trump is the Titanic and the iceberg is *dead ahead*. He *will* try to fire Mueller—a crime and impeachable as Obstruction. Congress must get on the right side of history *now*.\\n12/ The firing itself would be a catastrophe politically, but if it occurred concurrent to McGahn quitting, the chances that McGahn would be drawn even further into the investigation as a witness against Trump would be *extremely* high. And we don\\'t know what *else* McGahn knows.\\n20/ But it\\'s more than that: Trump was willing to fire Mueller when his level of legal jeopardy was unclear, and Mueller had brought *no* indictments and secured *no* cooperation deals with top Trump national security aides. So what is Trump\\'s temperature on firing Mueller *now*?\\n7/ Definitionally and legally, criminal conduct is not considered within the recognized duties of a president, which means McGahn\\'s role as an attorney for the Office of the President diverges from Trump\\'s own legal interests as and when the president has acted illegally—as here.\\n9/ No constitutional provision or U.S. statute ever has—or ever could—authorize POTUS to commit a crime. This means that while Trump *is* allowed to fire Comey because, say, he doesn\\'t like Comey\\'s dress sense, he\\'s *not* allowed to fire him to obstruct a criminal investigation.\\n16/ So what we know now is Trump had the criminal intent—mens rea—to Obstruct by firing his *second* person who was then investigating him, but no crime occurred because there was no actus reus (no act). The only reason there was no act was a key witness threatening to jump ship.\\n2/ Some will wonder why McGahn had enough sway with Trump to stop this from happening. That\\'s a very good question to ask. First, note that McGahn was the attorney from Trump\\'s winning presidential campaign, so the two have known each other and worked together for some time now.\\n14/ Indeed, there wouldn\\'t have been any story for the NYT to report—this would likely never have leaked—if Trump had simply gone to McGahn for legal advice about firing Mueller, and McGahn had advised him not to do so, and Trump immediately relented in the face of such advice.\\n17/ So Trump thinks he has the *authority* to fire Mueller, that doing so is *appropriate* and *warranted*, and he has the *willingness* to do so. Also (lest we forget) he has the willingness to *lie* about wanting to fire Mueller—as he\\'s now been lying about it for seven months.\\n6/ McGahn is protected from ever testifying against Donald Trump on some issues—but *not* if the conduct he is to be questioned about involves criminal conduct by the president. Remember that Don McGahn does *not* represent Donald Trump, he represents the Office of the President.\\n4/ If Mueller refers an Obstruction indictment to DOJ, DOJ will likely refer it to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration for articles of impeachment—and whether or not such articles come out of that committee, America already knows Obstruction is an impeachable offense.\\n8/ McGahn was present before and after the Comey firing, as Trump concocted pretexts for that illegal action and then—afterward—a coverup for what was a *Russia-based* decision to dump Comey. That decision was illegal for the previously cited reason about the office of president.\\n11/ Trump was represented by Marc Kasowitz last June, and either Trump or Kasowitz would have sussed out that if Don McGahn quit the White House because he believed Trump was about to commit a *crime*—and make no mistake, that\\'d pretty much be the basis—it would be a catastrophe.\\n19/ One effect of this breaking news therefore must be immediate passage of the bill to protect Mueller that was *only* not passed previously because the GOP told America—and they were dead wrong—that this president never had and would never have any intention of firing Mueller.\\n1/ First, here\\'s the NYT story. The upshot is that last June Donald Trump *ordered* White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller. McGahn refused and threatened to quit if Trump went forward with the firing. Ultimately, Trump relented. https://t.co/9mK4rkJHBT\\n3/ Next, we have to remember that McGahn is a potential witness—and, importantly, a potential witness *against Trump*—in the Trump-Russia investigation. McGahn was present at nearly all the key moments in the Obstruction fact-pattern that Mueller is considering referring to DOJ.\\n18/ When many many analysts, me included, were saying after Mueller\\'s appointment that he needed to be protected ASAP from Trump firing him—because we said that that attempt *would* be made—such concerns were dismissed as conspiracy theory and the bill to protect Mueller stalled.\\n13/ Here\\'s the problem: Trump didn\\'t back off from firing Mueller because he decided it was wrong or outside his authority or—better still—a federal crime. \\n\\nThis is a *critical* point: the NYT establishes Trump *only* relented to keep McGahn from quitting as White House Counsel.\\n10/ So McGahn can rather readily be used as an Obstruction witness against Trump, not just because of the Comey firing but much else—for instance attempts to pressure Congressional investigators to drop their probes or attempts to pressure Jeff Sessions into not recusing himself.',\n",
       " '2/ In Spring 2013, The New York Post interviewed Michael Cohen about the bevy of presidential polls you had put in the field. Cohen said, in answer to questions about whether this meant you were running for president, \"Well, we\\'re not taking these polls to stow them in a drawer.\"\\n14/ Mind you, this is separate from Schiller confirming that a Russian in your Moscow entourage offered you prostitutes. And hey, guess what? Artem Klyushin—a Russian in your entourage—had a best friend named Konstantin Rykov. What does Rykov do? He runs Moscow\\'s largest brothel.\\n19/ Neither Bob Mueller nor major-media journalists like Luke Harding are tracing your involvement with the Russians as beginning in 2015—when you announced your presidential run. They are seeing evidence that in 2013—and even before—you had let Russia know your political plans.\\n17/ All this is just the \"Cliffs Notes\" version of a mountain of documentary evidence suggesting the Russians knew you were running for president well before Americans formally did—and that they began their operations in 2014 fully aware that by mid-2015 you would announce a run.\\n3/ Immediately thereafter—mere weeks—Russia suddenly put in a bid for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant by wooing you face-to-face at the Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas in June. The Russian delegation needed mere hours to convince you Russia should leapfrog 19 nations for the honor.\\n7/ Yulya Alferova tweeted to you shortly after you left Moscow that she knew you\\'d make a great president. It was a topic you\\'d discussed with the Russians in November 2013 in Moscow as they were developing for you—with Putin\\'s blessing—a wildly lucrative Trump Tower Moscow deal.\\n13/ Indeed, Aras Agalarov publicly announced in February of *2017* (not a typo)—via a major Russian construction website—that the letter-of-intent you signed with him in November 2013 became inactive only *after* you ascended to the presidency, as you now \"couldn\\'t do any deals.\"\\nMr. Trump, you told the Russians you\\'d be running for president in Moscow in November 2013—and indeed it was that declaration that led to the anti-U.S. campaign in early 2014. Cohen had made clear by mid-2013 you were running; you confirmed it to the Agalarovs and Yulya Alferova. https://t.co/UyjT9QMqbE\\n15/ Fortunately, there\\'s no evidence Rykov and Klyushin worked together to help elect you. \\n\\nActually, let\\'s scratch that—as before the Buzzfeed dossier ever came into the public sphere, Rykov bragged publicly, on social media, that he and Klyushin worked together to elect you.\\nCONCLUSION/ *No one* in the intel community confirms your claim—or Pence\\'s—that the election results weren\\'t affected by Russia. And we already *know* from macroanalysis that your hijinks with Giuliani to coerce Comey into re-opening Clinton\\'s case *did* affect the results. {end}\\n16/ Rykov\\'s specific boast—which included facts that would later end up in the dossier, but which he couldn\\'t have known at the time unless he had access to classified U.S. intelligence—was that the plan to aid you in becoming president began, in Russia, sometime in 2011 or 2012.\\n4/ The Agalarovs, Ike Kaveladze (later at Trump Tower in June 2016), Yulya Alferova, and Artem Klyushin made up the Russian delegation, which overpaid you for the Miss Universe pageant by giving you $20 million, which helped keep the pageant from bankruptcy, according to reports.\\n20/ It will be found—as it\\'s the only theory of the case consistent with the facts—that it was your statement to Russian nationals that you\\'d run for president in 2016 that was the proximate cause of their decision to wage a massive cyber-campaign explicitly directed to aid you.\\n9/ The result, according to Emin Agalarov in a Forbes interview, was you signed a letter-of-intent in Moscow in November 2013 for Trump Tower Moscow—using funding from Putin\\'s banker (announced 10 days later), land from Putin\\'s developer, and permit approval from his permits man.\\n18/ It\\'s fortunate you only watch Fox News—as from watching that media outlet you would\\'ve had no idea that these events have been traced by both major media *and* independent journalists. And it\\'s from within that ignorance that you claim Russia\\'s 2014 actions are exculpatory.\\n12/ All this is *confirmable* by your tweets; the social media accounts of your Russian entourage; public statements by your own entourage; interviews given by you and others to major media; and statements you made privately to your friends at the time. There are pictures galore.\\n8/ We know this because Putin sent to your pageant—in his place—his permits man, Vlad Kozhin. He also sent his banker—head of SVB—to host you. \\n\\nAnd of course Aras Agalarov was and is the Kremlin\\'s real estate developer. So Putin backed out but gave you those three men in return.\\n6/ Cohen—childhood friend of ex-Russian mobster Felix Sater—of course had every opportunity to communicate to the Russians what he\\'d already implied to The New York Post about you running. Even if he hadn\\'t, you communicated it directly to your new business partners in Moscow.\\n5/ Your own tweets reveal you were also promised a meeting with Putin, which you\\'d been seeking for years. Yet by the time you arrived in Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in November, Putin had backed out—because your presidential ambitions were by then clear to the Russians.\\n11/ Within a matter of *weeks* the Russian operation had started up. \\n\\nYou, Don and Ivanka remained in regular telephonic and in-person contact with your new business partners—the Agalarovs, Putin\\'s developers—during early 2014, as the Russian machine began its attack on America.\\n10/ As Putin was—from a distance—arranging this lucrative deal for you, you were confirming the signals Cohen had already sent far and wide: you would run for president. Yulya Alferova, a member of your Moscow entourage, left your company in Moscow with no doubt about your plans.',\n",

Everyday she posted pictures of herself w/ various crowns.  #disneyprincess\\n27) And Stormy agreed to the contract, and thought her excessive income for things she was probably going to do anyway, would really help her achieve that status of PRINCESS. #disneyprincess\\n(19) Next he asked her name, and when she told him stormy,\\n\\n he said “I was almost sure you were a princess. “\\n\\nAnd Stormy said how “did you know”, \\n\\nHe looked at her backside,  then back at her and said “sometimes you just know these things” #disneyprincess\\n(21) 3 days had passed and over the course of those many many many days, Stormy had become sure she was in love with this DemaGOD.\\n\\nLikewise he too had promised that he loved her, and that would leave his wife as soon as she was old enough.  #disneyprincess\\n(22) They also began seeing each other every afternoon. The DemaGOD made sure to tell Stormy that for her own protection it must remain a secret between them! Again he repeated it was for her own protection, the public would harm her if the public knew. #disneyprincess\\n(5)However the year had gone just like the previous, &amp; the $$ for the building repairs had disappeared, although it was claimed 2 all be spent, &amp;the employees responsible4 doing the repair were still sitting in their office lounges, always working on  paper work. .#disneyprincess\\n(17)What struck Stormy the most about his face was that although he faced w/ two opposing arguments, he was able to split his face in two and seemingly smile and agree with both groups of people.  She wondered if she too with practice could split her countenance? #disneyprincess\\n9) It was that same year in which Stormy had become convinced that she was a  princess, &amp; had been mistakenly placed in the wrong part of the city.  Of this she was sure! #disneyprincess\\n(26) At that moment he called his lawyers and had him draft up a contract. In exchange 4 secrecy, He promised to provide her with an EDUCATION, &amp; a contract to pay her yearly in exchange for testimony against his political opponents and their misuse of her. #disneyprincess\\n(25) Although STORMY had some form of encounter w/ every boy in her school, she had not done so in several months &amp; was sure it was his child.

The 3X3 was believed 2 have come from the subdivision of a 3 bedroom apt into 3 smaller 3 bedroom apts, but that was not an accepted “fact” by the Demagods, #disneyprincess\\n(18) Then the man stopped mid-sentence, &amp; turned towards her.  As he got closer he began speaking, she could not make much sense of his comments it seemed to be about daily occurrences but at the same time seemed sexual in nature although not provable. #disneyprincess\\n(11) As stormy grew older, her unclaimed thrown weighed on her, &amp;at the age of 13 she decided 2 make it official by getting the word PRINCESS tattooed on her backside.

For the first time she was happy that someone else knew the fact she was a princess.  #disneyprincess\\n(15) she also saw the sign along the wall was advertising the subdivision as the 3X3X3 of extreme happiness and love, and noted that facts had shown they actually made people 27 times more happy. #disneyprincess\\n(2) All around Democrapia buildings were crumbling where great ones once stood, and all the apartments had been sub divided into even smaller and smaller apartments, the only exception to this was capital hill, where the great mansions of the DemoGods stood! #disneyprincess\\n(23)Stormy believed him, after several months of their afternoon meetings, Stormy realized something was different, she took some tests at @PPFA &amp; it was discovered she was pregnant. Thankfully they removed the need 4  parental consent &amp; she could keep her secret. #disneyprincess\\n(6) At 5 years old Stormy accidentally entered the gov maintenance building in which she lived, &amp; stumbled upon all the employees arguing over whose job it was2 punch everyone in, &amp; wondered if this was the reason the repairs had never been made to the buildings.#disneyprincess\\n(14) Stormy thought maybe if the foreigners were checked, it might have prevented the new project of the subdividing the apartments that had already been subdivided. But she stopped herself, remembering that school had taught her that walls were racist  #Disneyprincess\\n(4) Everyone was hopeful of the DemaGODS promise of MANSIONS 4EVERYONE &amp; believed their plan was soon to take effect, after all it was the platform on which they self elected themselves in Last the election that had “forgotten” to include all names on the ballots. #disneyprincess\\n(24) She ran to tell her DemaGOD as fast as she could as she was very excited with the news. \\n\\nUpon hearing the news the DEmaGOD repeated over and over it wasn’t his baby, she must have slept with somebody else. #disneyprincess\\n10) Knowing in her own mind her royal status, she blamed rampant racism prevented her claim to her throne.

       " '1/ A couple of years ago a case broke out in Goa. It started when a Swedish girl Lucky Farmhouse aka Lucky Moonfarm disgusted at the botched police investigation into her friend Scarlet Keelling\\'s death uploaded a phone conversation on youtube.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n2/ The uploaded phone conversation on youtube was of former minister of Goa Ravi Naik and his son Roy Naik (Lucky\\'s boyfriend) with an Israeli drug kingpin Yaniv Benaim aka Atala. When a local news media ran the story it was picked up and became national news.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\nManohar Parrikar is set to build a special squad to crack down on drug trafficking &amp; rave parties Goa. The issue however is a lot more complex &amp; pertains to India\\'s national security as we explained in our piece on #GetLucky – The World Of Goa’s Drug Mafia https://t.co/XKC4nlqE4D\\n13/ What Lucky also revealed was that Atala was supplying white models for bollywood &amp; politicians. These models were trained in #honeytrap &amp; was used to extract state secrets via their high profile connections. This indicate a presence of Israeli secret service Mossad\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n4/ Here is the Swedish Model Lucky Farmhouse who claimed that Goa Ex-Minister\\'s son Roy Naik was supplying drugs to her ex-boyfriend Yaniv Benaim, aka Atala, an Israeli drug dealer in Goa.\\n\\n#GetLucky https://t.co/hHy5CR8dkD\\n19/ In 2010 Goa police claimed they issued a Letter Rogatory to Swedish authorities for permission to examine Lucky in Sweden. Lucky approached Swedish police section Steve Als in charge of narcotics to verify facts. Als told her that no Indian agency approached them.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n12/ In a nutshell what Lucky Moonfarm exposed was a nexus between Ex-Minister of Goa\\'s son, Police and the Israeli druglord. She also claimed Atala was running India operations of an international drug/sex/trafficking racket. But it didnt stop there. There was more.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n14/ The most damnning revealation Lucky made was that Israeli druglord Atala also had ties with Indian Mujahideen mastermind Yasin Bhatkal. Remember Bhatkal\\'s links to Goa was also under investigation by NIA. Was an Israeli druglord operating IM from Goa?\\n\\n#GetLucky from Sweden.\\n10/\\n2 Israeli druglord Atala also\\xa0harbored\\xa0terrorists, hints at Yasin Bhatkal but takes no name. Although there are\\xa0separate\\xa0reports and NIA was already investigating Bhatkals stay in Goa. Lucky\\'s revelation makes a very crucial link.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n《Thread》on a very crucial case of national security exposing the Politician-Police-DrugMafia-Terrorist nexus in Goa.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n9/ After Lucky flew to Sweden a GoaHerald reporter managed to get her interview. What she revealed was\\xa0staggering.\\n\\n1 Yaniv was using Roy because of his father\\'s position to get crucial information which he was using for more sinister purpose than just drugs or flesh trade.\\n16/ David Headley stayed in a hotel in Pushkar, the C form was made available to the police. There were names of two other Israeli guys on that form with whom he stayed. The form is missing and the hotel owner blames the CBI for it. \\n\\nWho were thesw two Israeli guys?\\n\\n#GetLucky\\nA couple years ago a case brokeout in Goa. It started when a Swedish girl Lucky Moonfarm disgusted at botched investigation into her friend Scarlet Keelling\\'s death uploaded a phone conversation on Youtube. #GetLucky - A Curious Case of #NationalSecurity https://t.co/XKC4nlqE4D\\n11/ Before this episode there was another case involving the suicide of Nadia Torrado which led to MLA Mickky Pacheco’s arrest. As per Lucky\\'s info Mickky was also in close contact with Yasin. Rem it is Mickky who was made panel head probing the whole Lucky-Yaniv-Naiks nexus.\\n7/ Heres the video Lucky Moonfarm uploaded about his Israeli ex-boyfriend druglord Yasin Atala bragging about this connections to Goa Ministers &amp; Police.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n\\nhttps://t.co/oJxQMkecS9\\n17/ Interestingly David Headley also stayed in Goa with these Israeli druglords. He worked in DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) and ran a drug trade from Afghanistan to India. Even 5 Indian Narcotics Squad members were arrested for working with Yaniv Atala.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n23/ Alleged Indian agents asked her some red-light addresses around Stockholm. \"I was a bit disappointed though. They neither invited me nor did I volunteer to act as their cicerone (guide) in Stockholm, which I know well. They could have benefitted from my knowledge.\"\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n20/ Swedish government does not, under any circumstances, allow foreign investigators to examine Swedish citizens in Sweden. And Sweden never countenances any foreign requests to send its citizens for being questioned to any other country.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n5/ In her deposition to Interpol in 2010 Lucky said her Israeli boyfriend Atala had links with Roy whom they called \"Boss\". In 2008, Lucky had recorded Atala bragging about his links with Indian Police. The tape brought to light a Politicians-Police-DrugMafia nexus.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n21/ Such issues when they crop up are dealt with at country-to-country diplomatic levels and depend on the type of treaties Sweden maintains with the country in question - here India.\\n\\nYet there were Indnian agents knocking on Lucky\\'s door in Sweden.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n6/ Lucky testified that Atala had met Roy at Calangute, a beach village 10 km from Panaji, several times.\\n\\nLucky also claimed that Israeli Druglord Atala was purchasing drugs from the former home minister\\'s son and was paying him and the police protection money.\\n\\n#GetLucky https://t.co/ny1J8vCqwc\\n22/ Lucky told reporter that the alleged Indian investigators appeared to have been far more interested in pornographic locations in Sweden than they were in her. They said it helped them, in their work, to have a look at how such an industry worked in other nations.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n18/ So what Indian investigative agencies did after these explosive Politicians-Police-Narcotics Squad-Israeli Druglords nexus was revealed and also high-level mastermind Terrorists?\\n\\nMost logical step was to #GetLucy\\n\\nSo did they?\\n\\nKeep calm and read on.\\n15/ Indian Mujahideen Yasin Bhatkal is not the only guest Israeli druglord Atala hosted in his house in Goa. Another was DEA/FBI agent #DavidHeadley of 26/11. Headley\\'s movements in Goa was long under scanner by agencies. He was caught staying inhotel in Pushkar with an Israeli.\\n24/ This is how Indian agents investigated one of the most important cases of the country with far-reaching consequences.\\n\\nSweden is India\\'s first &amp; very dear partner in #MakeInIndia.\\n\\nWill GoI #GetLucky back to India to pursue this now cold case of National Security?\\n3/ Interesting thing is Lucky had much more secrets to reveal than just a phone conversation that could have exposed many big heads in Goa &amp; Bollywood. Inspite of telling the police herself no agency interviewed/interrogated her. She was also allowed to fly to Sweden.\\n\\n#GetLucky\\n8/ CBI &amp; CrimeBranch refused to investigate Goa Ex-Minister\\'s son Roy Naik despite several allegations of drug dealings. Atala was arrested with 8 policemen. Goa Govt appointed house committee headed by ex-tourism minister Francisco(Micky) Pacheco was investigating the Drug nexus',\n",

And if all your relational skills have been honed into exploitation, how could even your family trust you?\\n#RevThread   # 68\\nFancy Specks,Part 2: The Margin Man\\n\\n1/ Everything we love is at risk?  Trump and the Mob?  Really?  A reminder:  if you haven't already, a good place to start is with https://t.co/tzUWwtjdei and/or @LincolnsBible.  Also, the writings of Luke Harding.\\n8/ That’s where Trump wants to take us.  Apparently R's and White Evangelicals are only too happy to follow.\\n6/ Yeah, it’s really bad. Trump’s dealings with mobs enable them to continue in the child sex trade, in the opioid trade, in arms sales to terrorists, in slave trading and in selling uranium &amp; other components of nuclear weapons to rogue nations.\\n21/ 80% of white evangelicals voted for a man who owes his fortune to his mob dealings and whose epic immorality pointlessly threatens not just our democracy but human life itself. (cf Daniel Ellsberg’s The Doomsday Machine.)\\n23/ Remember the story of Edwin Hubble and the funny specks on the telescope? If our very stable genius had been in that scene, he would have ordered the dirty telescope destroyed and a new one built -- covered in gold gilt with a mirror instead of a lens.\\n16/  7) The use of religion to gain respectability?  Remember the Baptism scene in the Godfather? Maybe you heard Trump at either of the last two Evangelical Prayer Breakfasts. That sound from high above? The poor angels were barfing.\\n2/ Trump has operated for decades on the margin between organized crime and business. In the early phase, the mob was a part of his business expense, as a considerable portion of his construction costs, especially for concrete, went into mob pockets.\\n20/ This is the great Biblical text preached by revivalists. The leaders of the white evangelical church need to apply it to themselves. They are the ones who have been caught up in the evil ways of Trump.\\n12/... Plus the FBI, which Mueller had led, chases mobsters all the time. I suspect Trump knew all about this -- I suspect he flipped on gangsters himself when the FBI was chasing him.\\n22/  Great discernment, guys! You’re really tight with your god, but your god's name is not Yahweh; your god's name is Mammon. #emptythepews!\\n14/  4) The coziness with Russia. Russia is a mafia state. The oligarchs are simply gangsters. When Trump was flailing, they shoveled vast amounts of money into his company, &amp; in return got real leverage over him.  “The borrower is a slave to the lender,” (Proverbs 22:7) \\n\\n1\\n27/  If we can offer that integrity to God, His word promises He will use us all to heal our land.\\n5/  So is that so bad? To be a frontman for mobsters?\\n26/ Decide for righteousness and dignity and liberty and truth speaking. Insist on the values that are foundational to the nation. Reject this racist, greedy, lying predator and his party who are destroying our nation’s honor.\\n11/ 2) Of course Mueller hired a Rico lawyer, a mob specialist, right away! Mueller himself has prosecuted lots of mobsters. He knew what he was looking at...\\n13/ 3) The abuse of women. Parts of mob culture include the macho strut, the presence of the Moll, the exhausted wife who wants out of mob life. Think of Stormy the Moll and Melania the Long-suffering...\\n4/--  two favorite places for organized crime to put their money.  For example, once the mobster’s condominium is sold, the money is no longer traceable to the crimes where it was earned. Hence the obscure term “money laundering.”\\n19/ Here’s today’s first text:  “If my people, who are called by my name, humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”  (2 Chronicles 7:14).\\n28/  Here's the first part in case you missed it:  \\nhttps://t.co/WtSciuxDBT\\n24/ Here’s the second text from Joel 3:14:  “Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!  For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.” The prophet’s vision is of crowds of people stampeding back and forth in the valley.\\n3/ Then, when Trump’s business skills led to his several bankruptcies, he became the recipient of mob money, both in his casinos and in his condominiums --\\n25/  What should we do?  Stop stampeding.\\n18/ All of these signs are not so much revelations of psychological states as they are the results of mob involvement. Have you noticed how often Trump is dry-mouthed, often panting? He’s scared. When displeased, the Russian Mob kills.\\n9/ “Surely not!” you may say.  Well now. Let’s look again, shall we, at the 8 funny specks I put at the beginning of this 2-part thread -- behaviors that are so endlessly commented on by MSM, who look and look and do not see:\\n7/ Transnational organized crime is one of the main causes of oligarchical injustice. That’s what you get in countries where scores of millions of people barely survive,  while a few hundred mob billionaires loll about on their yachts. (Think Russia, Turkey, Hungary)\\n15/  5) The ostentatious spending?  “Mara Lago”, anyone?”  \\n\\n       6)  The dancing at the edge of the law?  Think about his 3500 lawsuits.\\n10/ 1)  All the weird, insulting re-namings.  Who does that?  “Sammy the Bull”  “Scarface”  “Lucky Luciano”. It’s part of macho mob culture. It’s a way of domination. When a Capo gives the moniker, he’s doing a parody of God, who changes, say, “Jacob” to “Israel.”\",\n",

       " '18. The TRUMP ADMIN ASKED FBI TO REVIEW THE GULEN CASE ANEW. AND THE FBI DENIED THE REQUEST. So this ISN\\'T just about Flynn. https://t.co/1vZnhbjLfd\\n5. ON TOP OF the infamous Gulen kidnapping we know about, Flynn may have conspired to FREE A TURKISH/IRANIAN gold trader who is IN JAIL IN US.\\n13. Guess who is in the DEFENSE team of the gold trader Flynn was conspiring to free? RUDY GIULIANI. It\\'s ALWAYS a team Trump treason effort.\\n4. The questions were part of a line of inquiry regarding Flynn\\'s lobbying efforts on behalf of Turkey. https://t.co/0dQSsWWchO\\n10. The meeting allegedly took place at 21 Club which is blocks away from Trump tower, where Flynn worked with transition team.\\n16. This was in late Feb. Guess what happened in MARCH? Preet Bharara was fired.\\n9. Mueller is investigating whether Flynn did in fact make this deal with Turkey and received MILLIONS of dollars in secret payments.\\n14. Giuliani met with Erdogan in late Feb. to discuss agreement to free the trader in exchange for Turkey\\'s help furthering US interests in region. https://t.co/lp9E8IOadE\\n2. That, my friends, is what George Washington and what the law defines as TREASON. Just so we\\'re clear. PURE, simple TREASON.\\n23. Flynn stopped the plan several weeks after he held meeting where alleged deal for a \"grab free\" for Gulen was discussed.\\n8. Now this gold trader jailed in the US that Flynn may have conspired to free? Faces charges that HE HELPED IRAN SKIRT US SANCTIONS. https://t.co/OMRB2AMwyn\\n3. Mueller team recently interviewed witnesses to the alleged meeting, that would have taken place in Dec. 2016.\\n6. Guess Flynn loved \"Prison Break\" and he thought if he could make millions on top of it, why not! 🤣🤣\\n12. Investigators are also looking into what role FLYNN\\'S SON had in this entire matter. So, multiple charges for the SON, too. https://t.co/40JLj0HGfy\\n22. Why? Because TURKEY opposed that plan. Said plan WAS supposed to continue under Trump admin and WAS approved after Flynn\\'s firing.\\n19. This is the ENTIRE damn WH trying to aid and abet Erdogan, a CRIMINAL who has people imprisoned, tortured, killed for disagreeing with him.\\n20. And that\\'s exactly what he wants to do with Gulen, whom he blames for that muppet COUP (who the HELL believes it was real) that happened in Turkey.\\n17. It\\'s obvious the Obama admin didn\\'t so much as think of listening to   a criminal such as Erdogan. The Trump admin instead? Right.\\n21. Flynn, once in WH, told Susan Rice to NOT move forward with a plan Obama approved to arm Syrian Kurds in the ISIS fight.\\n1. Flynn may have met with Turkish officials WEEKS b4 Trump\\'s inauguration for deal to be paid to SECRETLY push Turkey agenda WHILE in WH. https://t.co/Okd1QZ2kqt\\n11. Flynn was offered upwards of $15 million if he was able to complete the deal. Needless to say, MULTIPLE federal crimes here. https://t.co/DEdOrAXwkK\\n15. Erdogan told reporters after the meeting he had raised Zarrab\\'s case with Biden before and suggested PREET BHARARA was acting on behalf of Gulen supporters.\\n7. Anyway as I explained, the LEAD here is \"being paid WHILE in WH to SECRETLY advance Turkey agenda\", THAT, my friends, is TREASON.\\n29. And THIS is why Flynn\\'s arrest is going to be a HUGE deal. And why news keeps filtering to build up pressure. /END https://t.co/9CbFFOCxdS\\n24. Once Flynn was fired, the WH approved the plan Obama had made and they had an agreement on, regardless. https://t.co/MGb3PYLY3g\\n25. Not to forget: TRAITOR DEVIN NUNES was allegedly present at a meeting Flynn held with Turkey officials on Jan 18, 2017.\\n28. But it\\'s gonna be even worse if it\\'s announced that he has been charged AND HE COOPERATED in order to save his son. WHICH WE KNOW happened.\\n26. So involved in this FLYNN gigantic treason mess? Nunes, THE ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE, Giuliani. THIS is why these stories are out.\\n27. They KNOW (Trump, Pence &amp; the rest of their traitor team) they\\'re ALL involved in Flynn\\'s dealings and WHEN he\\'s charged, it\\'s gonna be BAD.',\n",

       " '1) A review of where we are and what the different theories of what\\'s happening with Mulehead are. Realize that some of these cross ideological lines, and Rob Reiner and Rush Limbaugh can agree on the \"facts\" of what\\'s happening, one supporting, one lamenting.\\n4) contd.\\n*Sessions, Horowitz, and RR are in on the scheme. \\n\\nSo, if theory #2 or #3 are correct, what the hell is Mulehead doing?\\n\\n5) Actively gathering evidence. This theory holds that Mulehead is, under the guise of looking at, say, Manafort, really gathering evidence on  . .\\n2) contd.\\n*He has charged Flynn with lying\\n*He has charge The Funnel with everything from tax fraud to operating a hot dog stand without a license.\\n*The Fake News Media supports this view cuz they really think Trump \"colluded\" and this plays into their scenario\\n15) The latest wildcard is the fake news report that Mulehead is investigating a murder related to the investigation--but not the Shawn guy. Obviously this is Seth Rich. \\n\\n16) Already we have seen a move by the fake news to suggest Rich was a Russkie agent. That is coming.\\n2) contd.\\n*Much, if not almost all, of the conservative media likewise accepts this because they all think  the Deep State is out to impeach Trump\\n*In this view Sessions is a weak doddering fool, who if not controlled by Rod Rosenstein, is manipulated by him.\\n10) Once the FISAs unwind, it is likely that ANY person prosecuted using a FISA will demand a new trial. Not saying they\\'ll get one, but those papers will be filed.\\n\\n11) I subscribe to the smokescreen. Mulehead gives every evidence of a guy just spinning his wheels very publicly\\n3) contd\\nI will address some of Mulehead\\'s actions below, as his actions in this scenario wouldn\\'t be different from VIEW #3.\\n\\n4) VIEW #3 MULEHEAD is working for Trump \\n*This view begins with the same as #2, namely Trump hired Mulehead after the interview.\\n7) contd.\\nFor at least FIVE MONTHS, maybe seven, DOJ has been engaged in three Cankles related investigations.\\n\\nThese are separate and apart from Horowitz\\'s Inspector General investigation.\\n14) The \"smokescreen\"/white hat view has to explain why Flynn was indicted; why NO indictments so far have come vs Cankles et al, &amp; what the connection is between Mulehead, RR, Sessions, Horowitz, &amp; Congress.\\n4) contd.\\n*Trump knew what he was getting with Mulehead, and knew either he was a \"white hat\" or they had enough on him to make him \"do the right thing.\"\\n*In this view, it is a theory that Mulehead has already been guaranteed a pardon or immunity. No proof of this--just a theory\\n3) VIEW #2 \\nMULEHEAD is a black hat actor who nevertheless was either pressured or threatened to \"do the right thing\"\\n\\nEvidence for this is:\\n*TRUMP interviewed him a few days before RR appointed him. Trump interviewed him for \"FBI director\\'s\" job---which Mulehead couldn\\'t hold.\\n6) contd.\\n*A different version of that same interpretation is that Mulehead has NOT been gathering any \"real\" evidence, and that his goal has been quite different: to provide an ongoing smokescreen/\"demonstration\" to occupy both DemoKKKrats &amp; the fake news media.\\n5) contd. Evidence, contd.\\n\\n*Tony Two-Toes and Pedo immediately shut down their business and began shredding stuff the moment this story leaked.\\n*To my knowledge, no one has seen Tony Two-Toes since that report.\\n*Mulehead keeps dancing with charges against The Funnel &amp; Gates\\n7) contd.\\n*Contrary to the view that Sessions is \"doing nothing,\" in fact (and, yes Virginia, these are facts)\\n--It was announced months ago that DOJ was already investigating U1 and had been . . . \"for months\"\\n6) contd.\\n*In such a scenario, Mulehead is marching back and forth, attracting attention but not really doing anything, while Horowitz and Sessions prepare cases.\\n*Moreover, in such a take, Mulehead could well be feeding information to Sessions &amp; Horowitz.\\n\\nHOWEVER, you say . . .\\n6) contd.\\nFurther under the Flynn-directed-his-fate view, few would doubt that Trump would make Flynn whole at the first moment that became possible.\\n\\n7) Leave aside Flynn and whether he is a victim or super-spy, what evidence is there that Mulehead is engaged in a demonstration?\\n11) contd. \\n . .  to attract attention while either he, or someone else, is doing the heavy lifting.\\n\\n12) Ror the \"Where are the indictments?\" crowd I will remind you that the AIRTIGHT case against Robert Hanssen took TWO years &amp; even with wiretaps it took FIVE years to get Gotti\\n5) contd. Tony Two-toes, Pedo, and ultimately Cankles.\\n\\n*Evidence for this comes from a Politico story months ago that \"FBI investigators\" associated with Mulehead (think about that!) were looking into The Funnel\\'s connections to Tony Two-Toes\\n3) contd.\\n*Trump at the time knew all the details of U1 and (supposedly) Mulehead\\'s involvement in it and gave him an out. Do the right thing, go down as a patriot, get a pardon.\\n*NOT popular with Fake News cuz obviously they think Trump is guilty and Mulehead a paragon of virtue\\n7) contd.\\n---It was announced months ago that DOJ was already investigating Cankles e-mails and had been . . . \"for months.\"\\n---It was announced months ago that DOJ was already investigating the Clinton Crime Family Foundation and had been . . . \"for months.\"\\n2) so, here we go. \\n\\nTHEORY #1, and clearly the most popular theory.\\n\\nMULEHEAD is a blackhat working to impeach Trump or \"find something\" that can be used to remove him.\\n\\nSupport for this view cites\\n*So far it \"appears\" he had only indicted or interviewed \"Trump-related\" ppl\\n9) So there you are. Those who think Mulehead is out to \"get Trump\" (again, excluding Flynn who may be a separate issue) have about 2 dozen nothing indictments against Russkies and/or the Funnel. \\n\\nHowever  given what has appeared in Congress it seems likely NO charges will stick\\n5) contd. Evidence, contd.\\n* . . . slip ups like the Politico report, the fake news media not only won\\'t report these facts, but wouldn\\'t even think to INVESTIGATE \\n*So all revelations have to come from \"alternative\" journalists like Chillum, @drawandstrike @TheLastRefuge2 etc.\\n5) contd. Evidence, contd.\\n*It\\'s almost as though Mulehead really doesn\\'t want to go to court with these guys. If this theory is true, it would be because he DOESN\\'T. It\\'s a show while he investigates the real criminals.\\n*It\\'s important to understand that except for . . .\\n8) I have hypothesized that most of what Nunes, Grassley, Goodlatte, and Johnson are getting are being given them by Horowitz, Sessions, and/or Mulehead. The paperwork is so massive, I think, even Congressional staffs would have to have directions.\\n6) contd.\\n\"What about Gen. Flynn? His life is ruined. Is that just a \"distraction?\"\\n\\nDepends. @ThomasWictor has argued that Flynn, a lifelong spy, has orchestrated much of this--that he knew what he was doing &amp; was ready to pay the price.\\n13) So, I think each side has points to address. The black hat/Mulehead bad crowd has to answer why he doesn\\'t seem to be doing anything; why Trump hired him; why Trump has NEVER given him a nickname; and why RR &amp; Sessions express support.\\n6) There is an important variation to the #3 interpretation.\\n\\n*Mulehead was never intended to bring charges against these bad actors himself, rather to hand over all his findings to Sessions/Horowitz and let them prosecute. That view assumes he IS gathering some key evidence.\\n7) contd.\\n---It was announced last week that on top of these three investigations DOJ was \"considering\" a separate FISA investigation.\\n\\nSo, regardless of which theory one accepts, it is NOT true that Sessions is just \"sitting there.\"',\n",

The true explanation exposes the exploitative class interests that birthed whiteness in the first place. Won’t do.\\nBut it doesn’t end there.

       " 'Compare also the transhumanists trying to \"live long enough to live forever\" (part of the same crowd who promulgate the Basilisk) with the rapturists who earnestly pray to be the last generation, to enter into glorious immortal existence without dying. https://t.co/oyAu37pyaa\\nIntrinsic in the Basilisk is the notion that creating a friendly AI is *a moral imperative* because it will head off human suffering and extinction, including other, less friendly AIs.\\nAnd since the God-AI is so good and necessary, doing anything to slow down its creation is evil and harmful. And that includes doing less than you can to bring it about.\\n\\n(Like donating less money to an institute dedicated to creating it than you possibly could.)\\nSo, there\\'s a thought experiment of sorts called \"Roko\\'s Basilisk\" and if you are deeply upset by losing the game or being made aware of your tongue, you might want to mute me for an hour.\\nAnd since there is no demonstrated ability to act in the past in a sci-fi time travel scenario and there is likely never to be such a capability even for an \"all-powerful AI\", the threat of future action would be its mechanism for influencing us now.\\nNow, the titular \"Basilisk\" is not the AI itself. It\\'s the idea, the meme, that can take root in your software, that you must devote yourself to bringing about This Very Specific Technological Singularity, or you--some version of you--will be tortured forever.\\nThe idea that a machine could be so far advanced beyond us as to be like unto a literal god but that we could fathom its motives and meanings enough to predict its future punishment of us is farcical.\\n\"A computer will simulate you down to every subatomic particle, and this simulation will have thought everything you\\'ve thought and react to every situation the same way you\\'d react and it will be indistinguishable from you in every way. Care very much about what happens to it.\"\\nThey\\'ve imagined an all-powerful, all-knowing, and loving God, who will lovingly punish everybody who doesn\\'t serve it. You can placate it by contributing labor and money to an institution founded in the God\\'s name.\\nYou can read more about it in detail here. https://t.co/w56CxKOtoq\\nIt also assumes that a friendly God-AI, seeking the most good for the most people, would want to have ensured its existence happens at the earliest point possible, to do the most good.\\nAnd I\\'m going to end the thread there because I told people to mute me for an hour, then didn\\'t bother keeping track of time. :P\\nEven allowing that the simulated me is alive and sapient and human (which I can fully grant), it\\'s got nothing to do with me in particular. A computer I can\\'t fathom decided to torture it for reasons that will never make sense to me, after I\\'m dead. I have no power to stop it.\\nWhen you put off doing the dishes until tomorrow, by and large you aren\\'t actually thinking of the reality of doing them tomorrow. You\\'re feeling that this means you don\\'t have to do the dishes.\\nI\\'ve observed on here before that one of the fundamental flaws of human psychology is we have a hard time actually seeing literal future versions of ourselves as ourselves.\\n@arthur_affect I think it was meant to critique some of the flaws in the assumptions it relies on, yes, but like the similarly-purposed Schrodinger\\'s Cat, it went on to be used as a way of teaching that which it critiqued.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/y1dCjkQycF\\nOh, but they are assuming the AI is friendly. The community that dreamed this up imagines creating an AI that will save the world. https://t.co/FUlTvUMBB7\\nI can\\'t bring myself to do that.\\n\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'m the weird one and there\\'s something broken in me. I also don\\'t care if I just lost the game and no one can make me acutely aware of my tongue.\\nTheir definition of \"friendly\" is obviously specialized and sharply utilitarian.\\nI think people who don\\'t believe the premises are flawed would probably argue that its creator\\'s intentions don\\'t matter, if the logic is sound (as they believe it to be.)\\nWell, here\\'s where the idea gets really incredible. \\n\\nAnd by that I mean, \"not credible\".\\n\\nBecause the all-powerful AI will be able to simulate you in perfect detail, and torture that simulation.\\n\\nWhich is the same as torturing you. https://t.co/o0dpze8WVg\\nThe short version of the Basilisk is that if you believe, as some people do, that it\\'s inevitable our technological progression will give rise to an all-powerful artificially intelligent entity, then you should do everything you can to make sure that happens, for your safety.\\nI\\'m just fascinated by the way these rationalists/materialists have so completely recapitulated the religion that most of them grew up in or around.\\nAnyway. Please don\\'t lose any sleep worrying about the Basilisk. There are legitimate reasons to be wary of AI. Most of them have to do with the way we offload power and responsibility to algorithms and then act like this has neither victims nor perpetrators.\\nThe AI has no \"rational\" reason to punish people who didn\\'t learn of and believe in the Basilisk notion, so it wouldn\\'t\\n\\nBut by that logic, wouldn\\'t it also punish people who didn\\'t spread the Basilisk every chance they got?\\nBecause the entity, being all-powerful, will be able to punish anyone who stood in the way of its existence.\\nAnd as @arthur_affect notes in this subthread, some permutations of it even have Calvinism-style predestination. We\\'re all either already righteous and saved or not and condemned. https://t.co/eALtPM4Oh4\\nI should say I don\\'t find any of this compelling. It\\'s a humanist/transhumanist\\'s version of Pascal\\'s Wager, and it contains the same fundamental error as Pascal did: it\\'s not an either/or choice, you\\'re betting on a specific number on a very large roulette wheel.\\nYou might also be thinking, \"Pascal\\'s wager assumes we\\'re all going to face judgment after we\\'re dead. Without an afterlife, dead is dead. Most of us will be beyond the power of the AI to punish us.\"\\nThere are a lot of wrinkles and permutations to it. For instance, it assumes the \"Basilisk\" AI is *friendly* to human existence, or else it would have no reason to punish specific humans; it would ignore us and likely wipe us out obliquely as it pursued its own purposes.',\n",

More inspiring\\ne.g. Straits Chinese (also known as Peranakan) found favour with the British. They straddled both worlds: emphasizing Chinese custom, speaking a creole of Malay &amp; Chinese dialects at home. They tended to speak English better than new immigrants from China, etc.\\nUntil the 1950s/1960s, most immigrants to Nanyang had no citizenship in SE Asian countries, and saw themselves as citizens of their ancestral homes, even if they'd never been. Colonial powers encouraged this. You were Chinese, but not to the idea of today's PRC.\\nIt bears remembering that 'Jews of the East' has been used to clobber Chinese communities and foster anti-Chinese sentiments; first by European colonial powers, which carries on today sometimes encouraged by existing powers.\\nNot enough Asian-American criticism of #CrazyRichAsians is aware of the realities in this part of the world.\\nYour identity was Hokkien generally, but more tied to the small village and to an extent its neighboring area, for example. \\n\\nSome early Chinese found opportunities in rubber, trade, etc &amp; became merchants. Their impact is felt globally today.\\nAs someone who straddles all of these words (being Asian when sometimes in America, interested in social justice, but also fundamentally Asian based in Asia, in country where my ethnic group is dominant). Who grew up among real #CrazyRichAsians in Singapore, my take:\\nThis is not your Asian-American 'be a doctor / lawyer!' world, this is a world where if you brought home a lawyer or doctor your family would probably think you were marrying down - rich\\nThere are loads of academic papers about how 'Chinese wealth' in SE Asia is held together by intermarriage. \\n\\nWhen I dated hyper rich Indonesian boy as a teenager, his family wanted my family tree. We could not date coz, obviously I was not an heiress.\\nHalf British, half Iban / Kadazan / other tribal group / even half Borneo Chinese is probably its own ethnic identity at this point. Traditional white privilege concepts are transferable to an extent, but not really.\\nI have little interest in real #CrazyRichAsians. I will not be watching it, because I could just open the Facebook pages of 20 friends from this world. \\n\\nAs an outsider, I think they all worry about the same things: love, family, and yes, even money.\\nEven in Singapore, where Chinese form majority and hold outsized power in government, economy, and social spheres (and Chinese privilege exists), regular Chinese folks (non-rich, even Singaporeans) could never enter that world. That's birthright, or marriage.\\nEven then I got the sense that the things they had which were intangible, unique, were not items, but access. \\n\\nToday, I see many of those folks in marriages they hate running businesses they hate. I don't envy their lack of 'choice'.\\nWorking class Chinese from southern China tended to follow set paths for them. They came to 'Nanyang' (south of the ocean, the new world), took on roles set out for them by their compatriots before. \\n\\nEarly social networks were granular. Not just Hokkiens did X, Cantonese did Y.\\nIt's about the fear of 'coming down in the world', like we saw during the late 90s financial crisis (and my classmates grumbled about having to downgrade to a bungalow in the bad side of Bukit Timah - lol)\\nThe world that #CrazyRichAsians portrays is real in Singapore. @kevinkwanbooks &amp; myself probably ran in similar circles. \\n\\nMy friends at school ate $30 lunches daily at nice restaurants, age 13; vacationed in private islands with royalty, age 15. I was an outsider in this world.\\nThis is not the world of the Chinese Singaporean friend you think is rich, who drives a car and has a condo and goes to Iceland on vacation. This is 'live in the Waldorf-Astoria for 1 year while attending an exchange program from other ivy league college' rich (true story I know)\\nAsian-Americans and Asians based in Asia are going to see #crazyrichasians differently. Some AA are happy to see representation in Hollywood; others, more versed in social justice see colonialism of East Asians in East Asia. \\n\\nAsians (in SEAsia think: I don't recognize myself).\\nObviously, the real world of #crazyrichasians is overwhelmingly Chinese. That's accurate. This world sometimes intersects with the world of Singaporean / Malaysian Indian merchant families, which is usually Sindhi.\\nIt's a different level of money worry, of course. It's not 'i have no more money for lunch' worry, not even 'not enough money for a Birkin' (they have 50, already). It's about debts or complex financial instruments their parents might have put them in;\\nNot being from that world, not really, I don't have to give up my dreams to run my family business; marry someone I dislike; or for women, give up my passion to run my FIL'S family office's philanthropy arm.\\nChinese identity in the Nanyang is complex, unique, very distinct from Asian-American identity. \\n\\nThere is both privilege, concentrated in hands of the few who wield extreme power; and oppression, in that anti-Chinese pogroms have occurred as recently as 1998 (Indonesia).\",\n",

Khususnya dalam mengakomodasi fikih perempuan.\\nKarena kita kagak tahu antum bermimik muka macam apa di balik cadar itu.\\nAlamiah kok, itu.\\nTapi tidak sepenuhnya bisa disalahkan.

Aplikasi menutup ini kerap dimaknai dengan menutup yang total.\\n\\nMakanya kepada (sebagai contoh) lawan jenis sangat menjaga jarak (dengan sangat radikal, bahkan terkesan keras kepala dan konyol).\\nGeneralisasi secara berlebihan terhadap simbol cadar memang termasuk salah nalar.\\n\\nTapi hal ini didukung oleh para pemakainya yang eksklusif, sangat tertutup, dan berhati² (yang melewati batas wajar seperti di atas).\\n\\nSalah, iya. Tapi bisa dimaklumi.\\nJika antum memiliki kawan yang sangat percaya pada antum, menghormati fesyen antum, dan dia tidak bercadar, maka hal ini tidak jadi masalah.\\n\\nMasalahnya, antum mau membuka diri (tidak secara harfiah) terhadap manusia lain, tidak?\\nAlasannya sederhana: menghindari fitnah.\\n\\nLogika fikihnya sederhana: menghindari mafsadat lebih baik dari mendatangkan manfaat (preventif).\\n\\nKarena itu, daripada kenapa², \"tanpa ambil pusing\" akses untuk perempuan dipersempit sedemikian rupa.\\n\\nDan dimulai dari tubuhnya.\\nPromosi dulu:\\n\\n😎\\n\\n#END https://t.co/XyyDQCYRE1\\nKembali ke Social Experiment tadi.\\n\\nSaya nDak melarang cadar, silakan, itu hak antum.\\n\\nSaya hanya memberikan saran: imej cadar untuk sekarang, dimulai tragedi nahas silam, harus diakui begitu menyakitkan.\\nSocial Experiment \"Peluk Aku\" Bercadar.\\nPelakunya jelas: bercadar.\\n\\nDari situ cukup sulit menampik (apalagi \"memutihkan\" imej buruk) bahwa cadar sebagai simbol relijius sudah beranjak menjadi simbol yang secara tidak sadar membawa teror.\\nPasca tragedi ledakan bunuh diri yang secara simbolis dilakukan perempuan bercadar, ada yang harus dipertegas di sini (bagi muslimah bercadar):\\n\\n\"Mulailah untuk menghilangkan watak asosial sejak dini (setelah muncul dorongan bercadar dalam hati).\"\\nSama seperti pengaplikasian syariat mana saja, hal yang bersifat teori kadang² terbentur dan memiliki banyak kendala.\\n\\nKhusus untuk cadar: dorongan menutup diri dengan cadar (secara harfiah) tidak berarti mewajibkan menutup gerak-gerik sosial.\\nAkhirat itu ditunai dari perbuatan di dunia.

       " '#10: In an Oval Office meeting into which no U.S. media are allowed (foreshadowing a meeting with Putin in which no U.S. translators would be allowed), Trump deliberately leaks classified Israeli intelligence to the Russians, who are allies of Israel\\'s (and America\\'s) enemy—Iran.\\n#16: Trump advisors Bannon, Prince, Flynn, Don Jr., Giuliani and Pirro are involved—to varying degrees—in leaking, sourcing, disseminating, and legitimizing a false \"True Pundit\" story that seeks to use fraud to blackmail the FBI into indicting Clinton. Russian bots pump it also.\\nBONUS: During the transition, Trump\\'s son-in-law Kushner secretly meets with Putin\\'s banker—after which discussion the two men disagree wildly as to what they discussed, suggesting that whatever the topic was, it was clandestine. Kushner won\\'t reveal the meeting for many months.\\n#2: In June 2016, Don Jr. knowingly attends a meeting with—and set up by—Kremlin agents. He asks the Kremlin for what he has reason to believe is illegally acquired Clinton material. Afterwards, he (allegedly) tells no one. When caught, he lies about every aspect of the meeting.\\n(THREAD) From Russian payments to Trump advisors to failing to register as foreign agents working for Putin allies—from perjury to illegal solicitation of campaign donations from the Kremlin—here\\'s a non-exhaustive summary of known Trump-Russia ties. \\n\\nHope you\\'ll read and share. https://t.co/gLv7TAGi7S\\n#11: In late 2016, Kushner and Flynn smuggle Kislyak into Trump Tower to secretly discuss the creation of a clandestine—Kremlin-controlled—Trump-Putin backchannel only a few principals would know about. The men don\\'t disclose the meeting or plan, which would constitute espionage.\\n#1: In March of 2016, Papadopoulos reveals to Trump—face-to-face—he\\'s a Kremlin intermediary sent to establish a Trump-Putin backchannel (he says Putin is favorably disposed to Trump\\'s candidacy). Trump then and there orders Gordon to coordinate a pro-Kremlin GOP platform change.\\n#18: For many months after Trump begins his run, he is secretly working under a letter-of-intent with Russian developers to build Trump Tower Moscow. The deal—brokered by Cohen and Sater—allegedly falls apart only when Putin\\'s top aide won\\'t return an email from Trump\\'s attorney.\\n#13: In 2013, Trump and Putin\\'s developer sign a letter-of-intent to build Trump Tower Moscow—a deal requiring Putin\\'s blessing that only goes forward when Putin dispatches to Trump his permits man and banker. Trump and principals lie about the deal—and events at the Ritz Moscow.\\nBONUS: When Acting AG Yates warns Trump that Flynn—his National Security Advisor—has been compromised by Russia, Trump fires her and keeps Flynn on board for 18 days. Either he lies to Pence about what he knows on this or both Trump and Pence lie to America about their knowledge.\\n#7: Trump campaign manager Manafort and Sessions aide Gordon aggressively push to change the GOP platform to benefit Putin under direct orders from Trump. When asked about Trump\\'s involvement, they lie to the media; when asked about their own involvement, they lie to the media.\\n#15: After it\\'s publicly revealed Russia is waging cyberwar on America, Trump publicly and in all seriousness invites the Kremlin to continue cyber-attacking America if doing so will result in the theft and release of his opponent\\'s private emails. He never retracts the request.\\nBONUS: Advisors to the Trump campaign, including Trump Jr. and Stone, have contacts with WikiLeaks and/or Russian hackers—the timeline of which conversations dovetails perfectly with consequential changes in behavior by one or both of the parties (including Trump\\'s stump speech).\\nPART TWO: A link to Part 2 of this series on Trump-Russia ties is below. If you find it helpful in summarizing what we know so far about illicit Trump-Russia connections, I hope you\\'ll share the link. \\n\\n\"No collusion!\" is a rallying cry that needs to die. https://t.co/7uV3FSD2nX\\n#20: Though he\\'s fully briefed on Russia\\'s cyberwar against America in August 2016, Trump publicly denies it—calling the U.S. intel community Nazis—while accepting Putin\\'s denials he\\'s done anything wrong and proposing the U.S. create a cybersecurity task force with the Kremlin.\\n#19: In 2008, Don Jr. privately tells investors that \"a disproportionate percentage\" of the Trump Organization\\'s money comes from Russia—a fact later confirmed by Eric Trump. Trump Sr. then becomes the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns.\\nBONUS: Though he knows by August 2016 that Russia is committing crimes against America, Trump still lets his top NatSec advisor, Sessions, negotiate sanctions with Kislyak—presumably Trump\\'s plan for a unilateral dropping of sanctions. This is Aiding and Abetting Computer Crimes.\\n#12: In May 2016, Trump NatSec advisor Papadopoulos makes secret trips to Athens to make contact with Kremlin allies. During the second trip, Putin\\'s also there—to discuss sanctions. It\\'s his only trip to an EU nation during the campaign. Papadopoulos meets the same men as Putin.\\nPS: People have long asked me for a one-link summary of what we know—which is only a fraction of what Mueller knows—in the Trump-Russia probe. My pinned thread, viewable with a button-click, aims to be that. \\n\\nIf you know *anyone* confused by the probe, please share it with them.\\n#14: Just before Trump\\'s inauguration, Trump\\'s lawyer Cohen and ex-Russian mobster Sater secretly meet with a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician to help ferry a secret Kremlin-backed \"peace deal\" to Flynn, Trump\\'s National Security Advisor. All involved then lie about their actions.\\n#3: In April, July and September of 2016 Sessions meets Russian Ambassador Kislyak in settings in which Russian sanctions are discussed. He holds the latter two meetings *after* it\\'s known Russia is cyber-attacking America. He lies about these contacts under oath before Congress.\\n#8: Shortly after the inauguration, it\\'s revealed that Trump has been holding onto a secret plan to unilaterally drop all sanctions against Russia for months—a plan he\\'s never before revealed, which would *reward* Russia for cyber-attacking America during a presidential election.\\n#9: When Trump learns the FBI Director plans to indict his ex-National Security Advisor, he fires him—first lying about his reason for doing so, then eventually admitting he did it due to \"the Russia thing.\" Later—in an Oval Office conversation with Russians—he repeats the claim.\\n#6: Carter Page travels to Moscow under the guise of an academic conference—in fact, he meets with top Kremlin officials and top Rosneft executives, speaking with both about Russian sanctions just as the Steele Dossier alleges. When questioned about his activities, he lies on TV.\\n#4: Kislyak egregiously violates longstanding diplomatic protocol to attend—as a guest of the Trump campaign—a major Trump foreign policy speech. Having been invited to the speech as a VIP, Kislyak sits in the front row as Trump promises Putin\\'s Russia \"a good deal\" on sanctions.\\n#17: Trump\\'s top advisors—including Manafort, Sessions, Flynn, Clovis, Page, Papadopoulos, Cohen, Sater, Don Jr, Kushner, Prince, Dearborn, Gordon, Gates, Stone and others—lie about or fail to disclose Russia contacts or key conversations on Russian efforts to collude with Trump.\\n#5: Flynn—aided and abetted by Kushner and the full Presidential Transition Team—illegally conducts sanctions and resolution negotiations with Russia during the 2016 transition. When asked about it by the FBI, he lies. When the lies are published, no one on the PTT corrects them.',\n",

We’re missing out on so many important stories from talented women and people of color. I refuse to accept this as “the way things are.” 25/27\\nThe most heartbreaking thing about VICE is that so many young people come there with a huge mission to change the world. 23/27\\nIn most of these instances, I was either the only black person, or one of a very small group. 18/27\\nWhat would journalism look like if we didn't push so many people away? 26/27\\nRe: Racism at @Vice and in the media world in general: (Thread) 1/27\\nI worked as a television production assistant (PA) for two years before getting a gig as an associate producer at VICE, and then a full time position as a producer for VICE News. 3/27\\nThey fired me after 6 months. 9/27\\nI was so pissed. When I brought this up to HR, I was told that they'd decided the comment “wasn't racist” and that I should get used to this kind of environment. 16/27\\nThe racism is systemic. The editor-in-chief of NBC News even forbade me from posting about these things on social media! (I quit a few days later.) 21/27\\nThey started calling me “The Weeknd,” because he's another black guy with unconventional hair. 13/27\\nI was at the bottom of the totem pole. I was afraid to speak up, and no one said anything. 7/27\\nThis was my first thread, did I do it right?\\nWe had to wear walkie talkies. He made racist and homophobic jokes throughout the day, on a walkie channel where everyone could hear. 6/27\\nThe media world is outright hostile to people who aren't straight white men. 2/27\\nAt VICE, I found out that I made significantly less than the other people on my team. My boss/VICE HR dismissed my complaints and told me that, by speaking up, I was making enemies in the newsroom. 14/27\\nMy first job was as a PA for a home improvement TV show. I was pretty sad the day Maya Angelou died. One of the camera guys made fun of me all day. 5/27\\nWhen I started, my boss stroked my dreams of revolutionizing the way black people are represented in American media. He only ever greenlit my stories that were about white men. 24/27\\nIf you're wondering why so few people of color rise through the ranks of media and the production, this is why: 19/27\\nAn executive producer on the nightly VICE HBO show, upon seeing Donna Brazille on screen at the DNC, said that she looked “just like Madea,” the character Tyler Perry plays in drag. 15/27\\nHere is some of what I experienced. 4/27\\nOther well-meaning black people have discouraged me from speaking to HR, because I shouldn't become “that person.” 22/27\\nThat’s all. I'm going to get drunk and build gingerbread houses with my family. I wish you all an awesome Christmas/whatever you celebrate! 27/27\\nAt the end of the day, he came to me and said: “Sorry for all the things I said today. I just hate gay people.” 8/27\\nThe camera department--all white men--bullied me the entire time. One night, on an overnight shoot, I walked from set and started crying. 11/27\\nA really great female director of photography hooked me up with a great gig as a camera PA on an HBO comedy series. 10/27\\nThe camera guys spent most of the season trying to convince me to quit, because I “didn't seem very happy.” 12/27\",\n",

       " 'Yet, irrespective of that, we also have to cultivate our own presence, in those shared spaces and otherwise. I felt the chill of not being included in those predominantly White spaces 15 years ago.\\nAnd some measure of the long game isn\\'t so much played by you, but also played by the culture that makes you. Let me clarify by what appears to be a digression.\\nRalph Ellison talked about Blackness as its own discipline of LIVING in his essay, World and the Jug. That\\'s always stuck with me. That Blackness conditions us to realize that just having a degree isn\\'t enough, even at the PhD level. You have to mint your life carefully.\\nLikewise, the discipline isn\\'t just in the work. Our elders always told us to work hard. But they often left things out, maybe things they didn\\'t know. Like, we also have to work smart. And working hard is not just enough. You better build a team and support.\\nBut once I thought about what was happening in South Africa, it made sense. Black South Africa\\'s middle class is only NOW growing. It might take another or two generations to have the expendable income to study astrology, for example.\\nThere aren\\'t many folks of African descent at US astrology conferences. And until recently, I had never seen a Black woman speak at an astrology conference. And yes, I had a hand in that.\\nWhat\\'s more, there\\'s no immediate income gratification in certain fields, like astrology or art and archeology compared to other fields, like law, engineering, or work in the media.\\nYes, some of that is systemic racism and based on the root causes of systemic racism. That I\\'ve never questioned. But there\\'s another issue here, too. Some folks also don\\'t play the long game, either. That\\'s #SaturnInCapricorn.\\nMost often, we must begin cultivating that time right now, thinking backward from where we want to go. I did and do. You can, too. And don\\'t think to fit in. Penetrate. And let others do the work of including and adapting to you. Keep in your power. #SaturnInCapricorn\\nSo, #SaturnInCapricorn teaches us that we must think like we\\'re all capital project engineers, on the brink of building pyramids and cathedrals that will last the test of time. We must also be prepared to act when the time is right.\\nI\\'m hoping there\\'s a young person outraged by seeing that and then motivated to getting a degree in art &amp; archeology of Africa, so she can curate art that belongs to her heritage. Yet, that still wouldn\\'t be enough.\\nBut what\\'s not acknowledged is who is often absent in the orgs, publications, conferences, etc. Yet, these folks will just say, that\\'s not our fault. On some level, they\\'re right. So, I reframe the issue: are we inviting diversity? Are we invested in diversity?\\nSo, I made a different resolution: I will build a platform &amp; body of work that will make them come to me. I did, and they did. Now, I\\'m in a position of power to create channels for others, and I do. @vegand has done a similar thing.\\nFor instance, going to college can sometimes be educational. But the key benefit is often the network. The network you cultivate there can open other doors for you. And yes a strong name to the institution helps too.\\nYou are buttressed by institutions and ancestors who\\'ve invested in you, perhaps even inclining you on a genetic level toward certain fields. For instance, I\\'m not the first \"mystic\" in my family. I am only the most public.\\nThere are many reasons, even beyond racism, why this might happen. For instance, take my field, astrology. There are many folks who feel astrology is racism free. Why? Because nobody actively discriminates in our orgs, publications, or who can attend our conferences!\\nWhen I was in South Africa for an astrology conference, I reported here that I was kind of surprised that there were no folks of African descent there, except as security and cleaning staff. I actually was surprised that I was surprised.\\nThis means joining the organizations, going to the schools that will maximize your leverage for certain positions. Establishing a niche in a field that prompts others to seek you out. It\\'s also about building alliances.\\nBut it also helps that we study and created our own networks &amp; skill sets. Again, it\\'s not just about credentials. The key is to have a base of discipline and support, like #SaturnInCapricorn teaches. Then you have to use as much #Mars (action and excellence) as...\\nRealize that someone once played the long game for you to be even interested in certain fields, like astrology or art &amp; archeology. It\\'s taken centuries for you to surface. And that\\'s true for almost any people.\\nWhen that symbiosis has happened, then there\\'s the possibility of mutation. That\\'s when likely we\\'re now talking about #SaturnInAquarius. We\\'ll talk about that in a few years. ;-)\\n#Venus to craft relationships and beauty in your interactions with others. Some folks spend time resenting \"Who you know\" &amp; think nursing \"What they know\" is important enough. Then wonder why they\\'re stuck.\\nFor more thoughts and lessons on #SaturnInCapricorn, study Barack Obama since he has it natally. (Yes, he\\'s coming up on his 2nd Saturn return.) He might have bought into respectability politics, but he still demonstrates some of these key lessons I\\'m discussing.\\nBut I also can believe, per even the little I know about the Art AND Archeology field, since both new curators have degrees in that field, that there aren\\'t many sisters &amp; brothers in that field. We are not plentiful in all areas of academia &amp; cultural institutions.\\nI\\'m grateful that the idea of respectability politics has been laid bare in the early 21st century, so we don\\'t have to spend another century promulgating it. Cuz this is not what I\\'m talking about. I\\'m talking about building power and platforms. #SaturnInCapricorn\\n@threadreaderapp unroll\\nYet, class and education aren\\'t the only metrics to think about with #SaturnInCapricorn. It\\'s also important to be clear on where, specifically, you want to go and work backward on how to get there. Take Brooklyn Museum curator position, for example.\\nSo, this convo about qualifications of this curator position for African art at the Brooklyn Museum has gotten me thinking about #SaturnInCapricorn.  I would love to know if Brooklyn Museum purposely sought out qualified candidates of color, especially of African descent.\\nCuz in many ways, you want to be so dominant in your field, that when you\\'re not considered, it\\'s clear that you were slighted for some reason. Cuz let\\'s face it: traditionally \"White\" spaces might not go looking for you.',\n",

SJWs, by definition, have undeveloped beliefs.\\n(18) But to an SJW, even military authority is open to question. Manning believes his sense of \"justice\" supersedes lawful authority.\\n(3) SJW atheists assume they know others\\' motives. Once I started respecting people enough to consider THEIR beliefs &amp; actions, I changed.\\n(22) People have to come to a place of insight themselves, pushing them only drives them away. Many SJWs have eventually seen the light.\\n(4) When people of faith encourage others to pray for others it\\'s bc often there is nothing they can do directly. They\\'re not there.

Atheism makes it more likely in a person but anyone can do it if they are a sloppy thinker.\\n(11) For SJW atheists, their lack of belief hasn\\'t been subjected to mature, logical scrutiny.

This is the \"certain information\" that he wants from the DOJ.

Pubic release of information will be determined solely by Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz. https://t.co/NWCimVSpFN\\n14) It is unclear when the finalized report will be released.

At times they will appear at odds with Congress, but make no mistake about it, they are working together and their actions will line up. https://t.co/aFebiNsfwJ\\n18) For entertainment purposes we get to also watch people like Chad and the media play catch up. What they say does not matter. All that matters are the actions of Congress and the DOJ. Actions that will make a Special Counsel to investigate the Department of Justice inevitable.\\n20) Rescinding immunity agreements and re-opening investigations can be handled without a special counsel.  Any findings that require the DOJ to investigate itself (#SteeleDossier) will have to be handled by a SC.\\n9) Here is the letter from July 27th, 2017.

       " '4/ In my experience, it\\'s not uncommon for some witnesses to be as evasive as Jeff Sessions. If they testify that way during a trial or judicial proceeding, the jury (or judge) will conclude that they\\'re not credible, just as some of you did when you watched Sessions\\' testimony.\\n5/ But being not credible is an issue when you\\'re already on trial for something else. Since Sessions is not on trial, the issue is whether his answer (or non-answer) to a specific question will end up getting him charged with a crime.\\n7/ To prove someone is guilty of making a false statement, the government not only has to prove that the statement was false, but has to prove that the statement was made \"knowingly and willfully.\" Basically, that the defendant \"intended to do something that the law forbids.\"\\n11/ Kushner wouldn\\'t have to testify at a criminal trial. (He could take the Fifth.) If he did, then the prosecutor could cross-examine him about every inconsistency and the jury could evaluate his credibility, like you did with Sessions.\\n9/ This can be more challenging to prove than you think. For instance, let\\'s take Kushner\\'s false statement. I suspect his lawyer will argue that Kushner answered many questions to Congress and was truthful in his responses to the others, so this answer was just a mistake.\\n2/ Two days ago, we also learned that Kushner told Congress he did not know anyone who communicated with Wikileaks, but he forwarded an email from Trump Jr. about his communications with Wikileaks.  https://t.co/DH5XTuuPTD\\n1/ This past week, many of you asked me whether Sessions will be charged with perjury due to his recent statements to Congress. Some of you also asked when being \"unable to recall\" an answer is a crime.\\n8/ As a practical matter, the government has to show that the person intentionally tried to deceive or mislead the person who was asking the question. The government also has to prove that the falsehood was \"material.\" In other words, that it could have mattered.\\n3/ So let\\'s start with the broader question. Many of you viewed Sessions\\' testimony and thought that he wasn\\'t credible because he often failed to recall answers, evaded answering questions, or answered different questions than he was asked.\\n10/ The lawyer will say that Kushner didn\\'t remember the email exchange with Trump Jr. because he received thousands of emails during the campaign and that particular exchange wasn\\'t that important or remarkable.\\n6/ Here\\'s a link to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which is the statute that is typically used to charge any type of false statement to Congress, the FBI, or an executive agency: https://t.co/ZBxdlkdCTk\\nTHREAD: How and when are people charged for making false statements? Can we expect Jeff Sessions, Jared Kushner, or others to be charged with making a false statement to Congress or the FBI?\\n20/ I watched that trial, and there was overwhelming evidence that Blagojevich was intensely interested in who contributed to his campaign, including wiretapped calls where discussing contributions. In the first trial, the false statement was the ONLY conviction out of 24 counts.\\n16/ That might seem like a slam-dunk case to you, but here’s what James Comey said about it: https://t.co/YMk6s9v569\\n21/ So the most likely way that Mueller could bring a false statement charge against Sessions, Kushner, or someone else would be to gather evidence that the false statement was about something that was vividly in their mind.\\n13/ So what kind of evidence do prosecutors use to prove that someone violated the false statement statute? I\\'m going to walk you through the evidence in some high profile false statement cases. Probably the one you know best is Martha Stewart\\'s case.\\n25/ So it is possible that Mueller could charge Sessions, Kushner, or someone else with making a false statement. It will generally require additional evidence that showed that the person deliberately lied, or evidence showing that the underlying fact was very important to them.\\n22/ It doesn\\'t have to be as important as the payoffs were to Hastert or the contributions were to Blagojevich. But Mueller would need to weave enough evidence together to show that the defendant actively knew that he was lying when he made the statement.\\n17/ More typical proof of a false statement is when the lie is about something that is enormously important to the defendant. For example, former House Speaker Dennis Hastert told the FBI he withdrew large amounts of cash to store at home: https://t.co/BI8RbgAgf7\\n12/ But most defendants don\\'t testify, and Kushner has a great lawyer. (The same guy who got a hung jury for Senator Menendez.) So Mueller would need enough evidence to prove Kushner remembered the Trump Jr. emails and deliberately deceived Congress without Kushner\\'s testimony.\\n19/ The same thing is true for another case brought by my former colleagues--the indictment of Rod Blagojevich. He told the FBI he did not keep track of or want to know who was contributing to his campaign or how much was being given.\\n24/ Mueller could possibly weave together evidence as Pat Fitzgerald did, proving that the defendant had a vivid memory of other events but was contradicted by multiple witnesses or documents on this statement. (Note: Libby was found not guilty on one of two false statements.)\\n26/ Obviously, if they\\'re charged with something else, all of this prior testimony could be used against them if they take the witness stand. Any prior answer can be used to call them out if it contradicts what they say at trial. /end\\n14/ This is the indictment against Martha Stewart. She was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice in additional to making false statements. As you\\'ll see in the indictment, the prosecutors had additional evidence of deception by Stewart.  https://t.co/yIOAfhLO3j\\n18/ But really he withdrew $3.5 million to pay a person who he molested when the man was an underage boy. No juror would believe that he forgot the real reason why he withdrew the money.\\n15/ The most important evidence to the jurors was the testimony of Stewart\\'s assistant, who said that Stewart erased a phone message that suggested she engaged in insider trading. https://t.co/sXn7VcaSvO\\n23/ Probably the toughest high-profile false statement case that resulted in a conviction was brought by my former boss, Pat Fitzgerald, against former Cheney advisor Scooter Libby.

       " 'Thank you so much for all of your questions.  I\\'ll answer more of them later tonight. If you want to learn more about the race (or donate or volunteer), please check out our website: https://t.co/C5IvNPAddh\\nQ7/ Do you support a $15 minimum wage?\\nQ9/ How do we combat special interests in Illinois politics?\\nA: Every dollar counts, and for those who live out of state and can\\'t vote, your dollar is your vote. If all of you gave $5, that would transform this race. Spreading the word also helps. Having a strong AG who will stand up to the Trump Administration benefits all of us!\\nOne of my opponents took $100,000 from Big Tobacco.  Another just gave himself almost $300,000, which removes the contribution limits in Illinois. My answer to that is to try to get more grassroots donations and volunteers.\\nTWITTER INTERVIEW: Here are answers to many of your questions about my run for Illinois Attorney General.  I\\'m going to type this out one by one, so check this thread for questions and answers.\\nQ8/ If Special Counsel Mueller is fired or the investigation is otherwise halted after you are AG of Illinois, could you do anything? If so, what?\\nQ4/ What role do you see the Illinois AG playing to protect Illinois residents against federal policies that hurt them?\\nI couldn\\'t sit on the sidelines during this time. As Attorney General, I could take legal action whenever Trump violated the constitutional rights of Illinois citizens. And I could lead the fight for working people whenever Governor Rauner tried to destroy our unions.\\nA: They\\'re both ultra-rich men who don\\'t care about the consequences of their actions. They don\\'t believe the rules and norms that typically govern the behavior of our leaders apply to them. That\\'s not just wrong--it\\'s dangerous. They\\'re both ruining our government. [cont]\\nQ3: Renato, as always, people will want to know who is financing your campaign.\\nWe need change, and that means giving people an alternative that isn\\'t just the same old politics that they\\'ve seen for years. I\\'m a lawyer who is ready to fight for working people against Trump and Rauner and I\\'ll bring honesty and integrity to the office.\\nQ5/ What similarities do you see between Governor Rauner and Trump?\\nA: We could investigate any unlawful activity that had a nexus with the State of Illinois. In addition, regardless of what happens with Mueller, I will investigate the Russian attempts to penetrate our voting systems in Illinois and issue a report with our findings.\\nThe issues we\\'re grappling with in Illinois are more ingrained and fundamental. Our state government is a mess, and we need to change our state government (and our state Democratic Party) with a grassroots, bottom up movement. What we\\'re doing isn\\'t working.\\nA: We need better campaign finance laws, including overturning Citizens United to get unlimited money out of politics. In this race, the limit on contributions was lifted. This creates a system where only the ultra rich and their friends can run for office. That\\'s disgraceful.\\nQ1/ What\\'s it like being a first-time candidate running for office in Illinois?\\nQ6/ Who has \"standing\" regarding Trump emoluments violations? Do states?\\nQ2/ Why are you running for Attorney General?\\nA: My campaign is financed through people like you. Hundreds of people making donations. No billionaires are financing my campaign and the average donation is under $100. Over half of my donations are from out of state, from people who want an aggressive AG taking on Trump.\\nA: The Illinois Attorney General stands with AGs across the country as the first line of defense against Trump\\'s constitutional violations. We\\'ve seen aggressive AGs like @AGSchneiderman challenge Trump. I want to use this office to be on the forefront of that fight.\\nThe specifics depend on the policy being challenged, but state AGs often are the best positioned to bring legal challenged to federal policies that violate our constitutional rights. We\\'ve seen that this year with the ACA, the travel ban, etc.\\nA: Yes. As Attorney General I will go after organizations and companies that try to skirt wage laws. I will also target wage theft. Right now, the process for workers to reclaim money they are legally entitled to is broken.\\nA: It\\'s exciting. I love meeting people and learning about what matters to them. So many people in this state feel despair about the direction this country and state are taking. I feel like we\\'re creating a movement for change that can take action on their behalf. [cont]\\nA: This is a really important time for our country and our state. We have a President who is threatening our constitutional rights and the very fabric of our democracy. In Illinois, we have a governor who has bankrupted our state and is waging war against our unions. [cont]\\nA: This is a difficult question because some courts will try to avoid this issue altogether and try to leave it to Congress. States could have a viable standing argument, but we need to investigate and develop a standing argument before bringing suit.\\nQ10/ What do you need most from out of state volunteers?

       " 'Whew that\\'s enough anatomy. But now you know how we detect head motion. Ok please stand up and spin around until you understand this system\\'s flaws. I\\'ll wait.\\nIf this were easy to do, you could read while shaking your book! But it\\'s gotta be perfect, and you can\\'t pull that off alone.\\nThe semicircular canals are the part that get out of whack if you spin around too much! Put too much velocity in the water and it\\'ll keep going and going and going even after you stop spinning the hula hoop.\\n(For non-head balance, you have another sense, called proprioception - a distributed sensory system that detects your body position. But that could be a topic for another day!)\\n@threadreaderapp unroll\\nI hope you all are ready to help me welcome #NeuroThursday back in action this week with a story about how you stay balanced - and the amazing things you accomplish with that ability! https://t.co/wqUzHsRvuE\\n(And by \"you,\" I mean the typical human. Maybe not you personally! That\\'s cool, you do you! But if not you, maybe ask your doctor – or check out the Vestibular Disorder Association https://t.co/n4Bh3tKZGK )\\nWhen this system goes wrong, you get a condition called nystagmus: uncontrolled movements of the eyes, as if it always thought you were aspin. Awesome creepy video ahoy! https://t.co/X1sgC1nrvC\\nNow hold your head still, and shift your screen back and forth instead.\\nThis is your vestibular system\\'s magic: it lets you tell what head movements you make, and compensate for them to keep your visual field fixed. Super useful for every activity that involves looking at things without holding your head stock-still.\\nYes, KJ, oh yes. Your balance system is doing highly badass things all the time, quietly under the hood while you go about your life. Like the devil, its best trick is making you think it\\'s not even there.\\nThe semicircular canal &amp; utricle/saccule all follow the same principles. They\\'re filled with Goop, and when the goop moves, it bends tiny hair cells. The hair cells are neurons, and they activate when bent. Bam!\\nSo what is this balance system? Mostly it\\'s the \"vestibular system,\" a set of tiny organs in your inner ear that detect movement of your head. Neaby the ear-bits that pick up sound, but distinct.\\nThis handy Wikipedia image shows the layout well. The important parts are the Semicircular Canals/Ducts (3 rings in the organ\\'s upper-left) and the Utricle and Saccule (blobs in middle). The snaily bit below is for hearing. https://t.co/H0wkpxa1Ag\\nAs you read this tweet, shake your head back and forth. Start slow, as if saying \"no thanks\" to this demo, then build up speed. You should be able to move pretty fast and still read this tweet.\\nOkay anyways. Now you definitely know the flaws in this system. But it\\'s allowed to have some flaws because it is SO GOOD. Let us demonstrate. (No seasickness this time, promise.)\\nHahaha no you can NOT read while your screen/book is shaking back and forth. Why the difference? VESTIBULAR SYSTEM, BABY.\\nSeeing straight yet? No rush, I\\'ll be here. C\\'mon! You know you want to! https://t.co/22e2LOBz43\\nThe utricle/saccule are simpler. Goop is full of tiny crystals. Linear acceleration will jostle the crystals &amp; thus the hair cells.\\nSo here\\'s your #NeuroThursday takeaway: your balance system is SO GOOD, you never notice all the hard awesome work it does keeping your gaze where you want it.\\nIf you want to be a goofball, test this in the mirror. Watch your eyes while you move your head around! You can hit a limit somewhere, but generally it\\'s a perfect match.\\nWhich is, really, most things. But if you wanna invent an evolutionary explanation, we can spin a story about keeping that visual field unmoving so you can detect actual real motion in the world.\\nDown in your brainstem, your vestibular system connects to your eye-movement system. That connection lets your eyes compensate automatically for your head movements.\\nHow the canals work: imagine spinning a hula hoop full of water - the water lags behind a bit. The hair cells are attached to the rim, so from their little POV the water is flowing past them, and they bend in the current.\\nYou can do the demo with this text if you\\'re reading on a laptop/phone. If you\\'re twitterizing from a desktop computer, grab a book.\\nThis topic was requested by the illustrious @KJKabza, who wondered: \"Are there special strengths of the human balance system (we all know that it is easily disrupted if you spin around)?\"\\nThese canals are for detecting rotation: if I just shove my hula hoop around (instead of spinning), it\\'s not gonna work. You have multiple canals in different orientations so that you can detect head rotation in any direction.',\n",
       " 'But wait. Saccades are *long.* (I mean, relatively speaking.) They can last anywhere from 1/20 of a second to 1/4. Shouldn\\'t you notice if your vision shuts off for a quarter of a second?\\nThis, by the by, is why you can\\'t see your eyes move in the mirror. Whenever your eyes are in motion, they\\'re effectively turned off.\\nYour brain then fills in that gap in your experience by BACKFILLING the final image over the preceding fraction of a second. https://t.co/h7XZQcm2Sg\\nIf this #NeuroThursday helped you appreciate all the hard work your brain does under the hood to fill in the gaps, share it around, ask some questions, or request a future topic!\\nAnd if you\\'re still working on your @TheHugoAwards ballot, consider my neuroscience, fiction, and editing among your Campbell Award and Best Fan Writer nominations! https://t.co/kKVidfeUh7\\nNo (or minimal) motion blur when you saccade. Why? Because your brain suppresses visual input during saccades. Low-level (brainstem) mechanisms clamp down, and nothing reaches your visual cortex.\\nThat\\'s where our clever and wicked brains sneak in, once again filling in those gaps. Let\\'s walk through the Stopped Clock Illusion.\\nTo me, this inspires humility. Our subjective experience should be the ultimate thing where we alone know best! And yet, even there, where we think ourselves the only expert, we can get everthing deeply, fundamentally wrong.\\nThanks everyone! #NeuroThursday will be on pause for the rest of the month while I try to convince the National Institutes of Health to give me money.\\nYou glance at the clock. By chance, your saccade occurs right over the moment when that second-hand was in motion. https://t.co/twdLYRVtLa\\nPsst want an easier way to share this #NeuroThursday about how your most basic perceptual experiences are built from your brain\\'s lies? Here it is in one tweet/link via Threadreader! https://t.co/AxDu0bCSQ8\\nIt\\'s a pretty common experience, sometimes called the Stopped Clock Illusion (or the delightful word \"chronostasis.\") We have a hypothesis for why it happens, and it may be my all-time favorite piece of neuroscience trivia.\\nAs they say on the twitters, \"let that sink in.\" It explains the Stopped Clock Illusion: you perceive the second-hand in one position for &gt; 1 second, long enough for you to recognize that something is off…\\nThe clock is working correctly, ticking along at the crowd favorite rate of one second per second. https://t.co/TUCiLqINxO\\nTo understand the Stopped Clock Thing, I need to tell you about \"saccades.\" There are, in short, normal eye movements. Your eyes jump from one spot to another, every time you focus on a different spot.\\nRemember, though: I talk about your brain lying to \"you,\" but it\\'s only lying to itself. So maybe it\\'s not lying at all - maybe it\\'s storytelling. Your brain is only fooling itself, but we all need some self-deception and identity-building to live through the day.\\nFor all our expertise, we can be fooled and lied to, even where we think ourselves at the peak of our wisdom.\\nAnd that, my friends, is a #NeuroThursday lesson to remember: \"your brain fills in the gaps\" is not just for little details and optical illusions. It goes down to the very fundamentals of our conscious perceptual experience.\\n#NeuroThursday returns this week to conclude our series on Your Brain Lies To You.\\n\\nThe greatest trick your brain ever pulled was convincing you that \"you\" exist, in a conscious sensory experience across time. https://t.co/htVrmUJNML\\nIf you\\'re just tuning in, this mini-thread over here will link you to February\\'s lead-in: how your brain fills in the gaps of your visual experience without your notice.\\nhttps://t.co/W1gmW4bBpQ\\nPart of the magic of saccades is that they don\\'t produce any motion blur. Test it: hold your arms out, index fingers raised, shoulder-width apart. Glance from one fingertip to the other. Then imagine sweeping a video camera back and forth between those fingertips!\\n(This suppression is useful, a valuable shortcut, just like optical illusions. If you know you\\'ll never get visual blur from your eye movements, you can more effectively spot moving things in your environment!)\\nYour brain - in the visual system alone - uses guesswork and inference to create a complete sense of space, acuity, color… and, as you\\'ll see today, time.\\nHave you ever glanced at an analog clock (with a second hand) and thought, just for a moment, that it wasn\\'t working? \"Is that clock broken? Ah, never mind, the second hand is moving.\"\\nI repeat: you don\\'t notice the brief moment of saccade blindness because your brain backfills the FINAL image over the PRECEDING fraction of a second.\\n(The other kind of eye movement is \"smooth pursuit,\" which happens when you track a moving object. Has completely different brain mechanisms.)\\nAll kinds of fun research has been done on saccades: for example, you can use them to learn where and how people focus their attention on a painting. Take a look, you can see the saccades themselves in the jump-pause-jump pattern! https://t.co/hmtofZi7hj\\n…but look at how your brain achieves that! It can shuffle and stretch sensory input without respect for chronological order. Your time-continuous visual experience is an illusion, stitched together by your brain after the fact.',\n",

Après avoir testé 1 ballon d\\'essai par son avocat #Dowd hier, #Trump est prêt à faire virer Mueller, dès aujourd\\'hui peut-être. Tweets clairs: l\\'enquête Mueller n\\'a pas de base légale, elle est démocrate.Elle doit s\\'arrêter.Point.\\n9) Mais cet obstacle\"technique\"de #Rosenstein ne durera pas pour protéger #Mueller. #Trump a déjà commencé avec lui son traitement classique. D\\'abord éprouver sa loyauté personnelle, êtes vous avec moi ou contre moi? Et Rosenstein n\\'a pas baisé la babouche.https://t.co/dSUleF6bsW\\n12) #Trump est donc passé à la phase 3: démontrer que #Rosenstein fait partie du complot politique contre lui (même si c\\'est lui qui l\\'a nommé à ce poste). Le mémo Nunes avait cette visée:Rosenstein a demandé l\\'écoute sur Page avec Comey, il est 1\"hostile\".https://t.co/tU73GEWUDp\\n15) Et contrairement à 1973, où Nixon avait DEUX MAJORITES DEMOCRATES à la Chambre et au Sénat CONTRE LUI, qui le contraignirent à renommer 1 procureur spécial, #Trump n\\'a rien à craindre de ses majorités républicaines en virant Mueller..RT https://t.co/AeMfVkGbN6\\n14)Ou #Trump demande à #Rosenstein de virer le procureur #Mueller (tel Nixon en 1973 avec ses ministres de la Justice Richardson puis Ruckelshaus), qui refuse. Il le renvoie et nomme 1 affidé. Ou bien il vire #Rosenstein, tout de suite, sans préavis. Il en a parfaitement le droit\\n11) Mais #Rosenstein tient bon, il répète que #Mueller fait du bon travail, qu\\'il n\\'y a aucun motif légal à son renvoi (devant les comités parlementaires, dans cette interview lundi dernier)...https://t.co/EQttdruxU6\\nLe tweet de la nuit US par #Trump: l\\'enquête #Mueller,dont son avocat a demandé l\\'arrêt, n\\'aurait jamais dû exister en 1er lieu. Et le président de reprendre l\\' idée démentie même par le rapport républicain Nunes d\\'1 enquête basée sur le rapport de renseignement privé Steele...RT https://t.co/HGOW85duet\\n2) Pourquoi cette nouvelle saillie nocturne de #Trump? Sans doute parce que #Mueller non content d\\'assigner ses documents d\\'affaire avec la #Russie a envoyé les questions qu\\'il souhaiterait poser au président...L\\'intrigue se resserre...https://t.co/tWEdPVQoBb\\n8) Il n\\'y a plus qu\\'1 seul verrou empêchant légalement #Trump de virer #Mueller. Seul le no.2 du ministère de la Justice Rosenstein peut passer cet ordre, car le ministre Sessions, lui aux ordres (cf. renvoi de McCabe) s\\'est récusé de l\\'enquête Russie. Et il ne veut pas le passer\\n4) Pour #Trump, le renvoi de #McCabe établit le\"complot\" démocrate à l\\'intérieur du #FBI contre lui, mené d\\'abord par #Comey et prolongé aujourd\\'hui par #Mueller. Ses tweets depuis hier soir construisent à partir de là l\\'argument\"politique\" pour renvoyer le procureur spécial...\\n5) Le récit de #Trump: la collusion avec la #Russie est 1 invention des démocrates reprise à l\\'intérieur du #FBI par des affidés de #Clinton dont #Comey car nommé par #Obama et #McCabe car sa femme a fait de la politique. Et les procs adjoints de #Mueller sont démocrates...#CQFD\\n3)#Breaking Et dès ce dimanche matin, #Trump repasse en boucle contre l\\'enquête #Mueller...1 cap est franchi: comme expliqué hier(cf. #thread épinglé),il tient son argument. S\\'il y a complot de #McCabe et #Comey contre lui, le procureur est leur complice...https://t.co/x11ySsHmIW\\n6) Peu importe pour #Trump que McCabe, Comey et Mueller soient tous 3 des républicains, que #McCabe ait été renvoyé pour avoir fuité des informations qui l\\'ont favorisé et contribué à son élection...on n\\'est plus dans le réel mais dans la maîtrise du récit médiatique et politique\\n13) Grâce au mémo #Nunes et au renvoi de #McCabe, qui a été supervisé à la Justice par #Rosenstein, #Trump estime maintenant avoir les motifs pour virer Rosenstein et le remplacer par 1 liquidateur de Mueller. 2 méthodes s\\'offrent à lui...\\n10) Comme #Rosenstein a laissé entendre qu\\'il ne virerait jamais #Mueller, #Trump a alors commencé sa phase 2: délégitimer publiquement son travail et laisser entendre en privé qu\\'il allait le saquer...https://t.co/KqwExsQgz0\\n23) Ah oui, attention, il y a le sénateur Graham de Caroline du Sud qui menace #Trump:\"Virer #Mueller serait la fin de votre présidence\"Le même Graham qui traitait #Trump de \"cinglé\"(kook) avant de devenir son partenaire énamouré de golf. #Mueller doit se sentir protégé...#lol\\n26) Bref, les moulinets de #Graham face à #Trump sur #Mueller doivent être pris pour ce qu\\'ils sont: de la posture pour complaire à 1 presse nationale hostile à l\\'idée du renvoi du procureur. Mais qu\\'en restera-t-il au pied du mur? Comme toujours.Rien. https://t.co/SfASwMfMRz\\n17) Il n\\'y a PAS et n\\'y aura JAMAIS de\"résistance républicaine\"...et pourquoi devrait-il y en avoir d\\'ailleurs? #Trump a été leur candidat, choisi démocratiquement, il est toujours approuvé à plus de 80% par leurs électeurs. Pourquoi voudriez-vous qu\\'ils défendent #Mueller?\\n20) La réponse est à la fois simple et complexe. #Mueller vient d\\'assigner la firme #Trump pour ses documents sur des liens commerciaux avec la #Russie qu\\'il a toujours niés. Assigner(= contraindre) signifie que #Mueller n\\'a plus confiance dans la coopération de la firme Trump...\\n21)...et cette assignation, doublée des questions envoyées par #Mueller au président #Trump, signifie que ce dernier verra dévoiler toutes les zones d\\'ombre soigneusement cachées au peuple US (cf. ses déclarations fiscales par exemple). Et, apparemment, il ne peut l\\'accepter...\\n22) S\\'il devait y avoir UNE preuve de comportement délictuel de #Trump, son attitude face à #Mueller depuis 48h est la meilleure possible. Mais comme dans le Bon, la Brute et le Truand, il y a ceux qui ont 1 pistolet chargé et ceux qui creusent...et #Mueller creuse...#àsuivre\\n27) Et comme le note @maggieNYT, la Saint-Simon de la présidence #Trump, le président teste jusqu\\'où il peut aller sur #Mueller. Et le silence des leaders républicains du Congrès (ou les tartarinades d\\'1 Graham démonétisé)lui prouve qu\\'il a de la marge.RT+https://t.co/bc4rStTpMN\\n28) #Breaking 1 autre avocat de #Trump, Cobb, affirme ce soir par communiqué que le président nie vouloir virer #Mueller...MAIS quel poids ont des avocats, se tirant de surcroît la bourre, face à 1 #Trump qui veut fonctionner sur son instinct? RT+ https://t.co/OlCCRREUYU\\n25)Graham qui, bref candidat présidentiel en 2016 fut crédité face à #Trump par les sondages de 1% dans son Etat de Caroline du Sud, ne représente plus rien chez les républicains,sinon sa faconde pour shows politiques du dimanche matin,et a besoin de Trump pour être réélu en 2020\\n19) C\\'est donc maintenant 1 question de temps et d\\'opportunité politique avant que #Trump ne lance l\\'opération \"Virer #Mueller\" mais on est dans du très court terme à lire ses tweets. 24h? 1 semaine? 1 mois? La vraie question politique est POURQUOI ce passage à l\\'élimination?\\n18) D\\'ailleurs, le renvoi de #McCabe sur proposition de l\\'IG de la Justice Horowitz est pain bénit pour ces élus républicains, achevant tout scrupule, car elle leur permettra de dire, si #Trump vire #Mueller:\"Cette enquête du FBI était vraiment biaisée et pas claire\"...\\n24) Le sénateur républicain Graham est la caricature de l\\'attitude des élus républicains face à #Trump.Après Charlottesville en août 2017 procureur moral d\\'1 président défendant des nazis.5 mois plus tard, il jouait au golf avec lui et vantait ses parcours.https://t.co/Bsh7eTLt0A',\n",

       " '23/ EVERYTHING was fabricated. The idea of #TrumpRussiaCollusion was a fabrication. The #ClintonDossier was a fabrication to help justify this lie. The investigation of #Papadopoulos was a fabrication to move the timeline back to the spring of 2016. Why? Why the need?\\n25/ The targeting of conservatives by the #IRS was just a sliver of the abuse under #Obama. #Obama and the #DeepState had created the database of all databases on ALL Americans, combining data from IC systems such as #PRISM w/data fed by #Google, #Facebook, #Twitter, &amp; #Amazon.\\n20/ The problem is, when you lie over and over, the threads in the lie become frayed. The sweater of lies simply pulls apart. The \"Papa\" story of \"having the emails\" has no merit. The timelines do not work, per this tweet by @JulianAssange of #Wikileaks.\\nhttps://t.co/OVD9zPheIl https://t.co/xj5yF0lPRD\\n16/ The truth emerged that the #FISA warrant was issued based upon a politically-fabricated piece of opposition research funded by #HRC. Things got worse for the #Coup #Traitors when it became clear the dossier was not just unverified but factually disproven in many key facets.\\n18/ #Democrat efforts to refute truth about the #FISAMemo failed as they did nothing to address the points outlined above. It was later discovered, through the #StrzokPageTexts, that the lead investigators had a very cozy relationship w/Obama-appointed #FISA Judge #RudyContreras.\\n4/ To repeat:\\n\"Do you understand the gravity of what’s unfolding?\"\\n\\nProof will come out that #Traitor44, #Hillary, and the #Democrat Party had weaponized our intelligence services to spy on ALL Americans, targeting those identified as the \"enemy\"...think Tea Party, #Trump, etc...\\n10/ Despite these efforts, they couldn\\'t generate evidence of collusion, so the #DOJ hastily overrode a visa block for Russian spy (and #FusionGPS agent) Natalia #Veselnitskaya, allowing her to meet #DonaldTrumpJr in #TrumpTower. The meeting was a trap:\\nhttps://t.co/U1GPn3LZa9\\n26/ Now you can understand what #MaxineWaters meant when describing Obama\\'s #BigBrother #Database, the \"kind of database that no-one has ever seen before.\"\\nhttps://t.co/OO48aBLyPw\\n3/ Part 2 of above #QAnon post #1238:\\nDo you understand the gravity of what’s unfolding?\\nEVIL &amp; CORRUPTION.\\nShe had to win at all costs.\\nYou know why.\\nHow do people support/vote 4 these people?...\\nhttps://t.co/d3YMqgBIvw\\nQ\\n\\nScreenshot of Post #1238: https://t.co/d9CHYwXavv\\n9/ ...such as #Papadopoulos, #Manafort, and #CarterPage.\\n- Papadopoulis repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, tried to schedule meetings w/Russian agents.\\n- Manafort was heavily connected to Russian oligarchs and the #PodestaGroup.\\n- Page was an undercover FBI informant against Russia!\\n24/ The fabrication was NEEDED because #Obama, #HRC, the #Dems, and the #DeepState had been spying on American Citizens, all of us, under the guise of protecting us. They had weaponized the intelligence apparatus for political gain, targeting their enemies to maintain power.\\n13/ And WHAT was the basis of this extreme level of spying on the entire Trump Campaign? It was the #ClintonDossier. This is the proper name for the dossier supposedly prepared by former British spy #ChristopherSteele...based upon 2nd- and 3rd-party input from Russian spies!!\\n*Now you know the #Coup IS not a theory.*\\nI hate pumping out a thread quickly and finding typos!\\nPlease excuse as T does not provide an edit function.\\n15/ So the whole basis for the lie that Trump may have colluded w/Russia is a dossier that #HRC\\'s team at #FusionGPS (paid through #PerkinsCoie to shroud the flow of money). This document was created by HRC\\'s people colluding w/Russian agents to fabricate the fantasy dossier.\\n2/ #Q post in 2 pieces [interpretation in brackets]:\\nApr 22 2018 12:58:19 (EST) Q !xowAT4Z3VQ ID: 195414 1145824 NEW\\nNot ‘official’ product - 5 Eyes.\\nListen carefully.\\nNo evidence to support POTUS targeting.\\nNone. [FBI counterintelligence op was NOT based in official intel]\\n...\\n12/ The type of #FISA warrant the #FBI obtained to spy ON ITS OWN RUSSIAN INFORMANT [EMPHASIS], #CarterPage, was the most extreme type, allowing \"two-hop\" surveillance, essentially totally espionage of ALL communications by ALL involved in Trump\\'s team. \\nhttps://t.co/N09g2NqXLF https://t.co/XrK3izPIbL\\n21/ So this is how we got to where we are today, w/ #DevinNunes wondering what...at all...was the REAL basis for spying on #Trump and his team? The #CarterPage #FISA answer does not explain spying that had been happening earlier. The #Papadopoulis thread has zero merit in the IC.\\n11/ After being denied once by the #FISA courts, the #FBI managed to finally get a #FISA approval to spy on #CarterPage, a negligible figure on #TeamTrump, who never even met or spoke with Trump. No matter. The point of the warrant was legal ACCESS to spy on #TeamTrump.\\n28/ Now you know that Trump ALWAYS KNEW about #ObamaGate. He was aware from the start, BEFORE he took office, that #Obama was listening in to everything he said or did. While the #LSM mocked, this tweet was #Truth:\\nhttps://t.co/F3TxNQzH2q\\n19/ As exposure of the fraud perpetrated on the #FISA courts to obtain the warrant against #CarterPage emerged, #Dems were forced to change the \"rationale\" for the investigation into #TrumpRussiaCollusion. They focused on the investigation starting w/a focus on #Papadopoulos.\\n14/ In other words, and this is not an exaggeration, the warrant to spy on Trump and his campaign for possible collusion w/Russia was a political hit piece prepared by someone who did not even visit Russia, based on input from Russian assets, paid for by the #DNC and #HRC.\\n8/ They knew they had a compliant #MockingBirdMedia that would not uncover the duplicity of the faux investigation. They further expected to get enough dirt on Trump w/o trying to nail him...but that did not work...so they PLANTED evidence...people w/connections to Russia...\\n1/\\n#QAnon\\n#Spying\\n#ObamaGate\\n\\nFor those who have not followed this closely and are just learning, the very latest post by #Q begins to lay the groundwork for the big reveal, which involves broad, illegal #SPYING by #Obama/#HRC/#DEMs against political enemies, including #Trump. https://t.co/QxyTJtjgod\\n22/ The reason it is so hard to answer this question is that there was NEVER A BASIS TO TARGET TRUMP for an investigation. Not only was there never any collusion w/Russia, there was never any actionable intelligence to posit the theory in the first place.\\n7/ The insurance policy had two aspects. 1st, they thought it would provide \"cover\" for all the spying they had been doing on Trump and others...using the FISA courts to uncover \"Russian Collusion.\" 2nd, they saw it as a means to delegitimize Trump, leading to his impeachment.\\n29/ Now you know what #Q meant when he wrote today:\\n\"Do you understand the gravity of what’s unfolding?\"\\nNow you know why they feared Trump\\'s threat to #DrainTheSwamp.\\nNow you know the #Coup was is not a theory.\\nNow we are just filling in the details.\\n/END\\nhttps://t.co/aABtDJViAD\\n27/ Now you can understand why #Trump moved his campaign headquarters across the river from #TrumpTower the day after meeting hero #AdmiralMikeRogers on November 17. 2016...as Rogers informed him of the ongoing wiretapping of Trump Tower:\\nhttps://t.co/E5TnzOsAI6\\n6/ Reread this #Strzok text to #Page:\\n“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in [Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s] office—that there’s no way [Trump] gets elected—but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy...\"\\nhttps://t.co/ECHPLsmLkq\\n5/ The reason top brass at the #DOJ/#FBI have tried to hide the initial reason behind the surveillance of #Trump\\'s team was that it was w/o legal merit. They had started the spying years ago. With Trump, the spying went back to at least 2015. They NEVER thought she would lose...\\n17/ The problems w/the #FISA warrant increased when we learned the FISA court was not even informed that the dossier was unverified or that it had been funded by #HRC\\'s campaign and the #DNC. Foregoing these disclosures to the court revealed intentional abuse of the FISA courts.',\n",

The Mail’s “campaign” may have been decisive. \\nAnd @ameliagentleman must be delighted that it\\'s picked up another of her case studies. https://t.co/3XHAFbiCmp\\nToday’s paper includes a ragout from its Saturday essay, headlined “What an outrage!” (You may have missed it or not realised what it was about – that could be the heading on almost any Saturday essay). https://t.co/4ARlFbG2cR\\nAnyway, at least it dug out the injustice to the Windrush man it calls Albert Thompson.  \\nThat involved reading all the way down to the ninth paragraph of a story by @ameliagentleman in the Guardian last Tuesday. https://t.co/EkYY0QWaiW\\nThe essay explains that his plight was down to “draconian new immigration policies” introduced in 2012 that required paperwork “which few British citizens could provide”. https://t.co/NLsOQOIWnn\\nThe Mail has clout. It can change things for the better when it puts its mind to it. This could be described as good #journalism.\\nBut good journalism (imho) also requires giving the reader the full story, not just the convenient bits.\\nIt told the story of a man who was told he must pay £54k for cancer treatment because he couldn’t show he had the right to live in Britain, his home for 44 yrs. https://t.co/v5BPc4K37C\\nWhy was it so low in that feature? Because @Ameliagentleman had written about him several times before over the previous month. Letters had been written to the PM, Corbyn had spoken about him. An appeal had raised money for for his treatment. None of this was reported in the Mail https://t.co/7QhfD1Kbw3\\nPS:\\nIf the Mail is self-aggrandising in its role in this story, at least it recognised injustice (eventually) and tried to get something done. \\nThis head in the Telegraph is jaw-dropping. \"Granted\" an apology? Lord help us.\\nHave a nice day. https://t.co/D15VqI93qU\\nAs Prime Minister, she was made aware of its impact, if only on Albert Thompson – a case described by her Mail cheerleaders as an outrage. She refused to intervene. She was asked to meet Caribbean leaders and said No. Only after yesterday’s outcry did she relent.\\nToday it has equally gently rebuked her for not agreeing straight away to meet the Caribbean leaders. But it has ignored her role in creating this mess.\\nShe introduced the “hostile environment” policy that has led to injustice and stress for the #windrushgeneration.\\nAnd in case it wasn\\'t clear earlier (sorry, this monster has so many tentacles), the Mail is heaping ordure on Remainer Rudd because...\\nRemember this? Poor Boris and a cross between Tootsie and Mary Whitehouse? https://t.co/sIegjLuzuk\\nWhen Cameron suggested bombing Syria in 2013, the Mail was stridently against. When Blair went to war in Iraq, the Mail was stridently against. When May prepared to bomb Syria, the Mail gave her a gentle warning not to.\\nBecause everything comes down to #Brexit. The Mail is backing May to deliver. Nothing must be said or done to undermine her. #TeflonTheresa\\nAs Home Secretary, Theresa May was responsible for policy for six years. She introduced “go home” vans. She lied about a man being saved from deportation because of his cat. She blamed courts and the EU for problems she had the powers to address herself.\\nAnd there’s yet more: \\nFurther evidence of May’s fingerprints on this debacle...\\nhttps://t.co/acQzcfFhc5\\nIn 2011, she told the Tory conference about some of the changes she planned and was applauded for them in the Mail. https://t.co/HywR19usPT\\nShe made another important speech the following year, spelling out more measures she was taking, repeating the pledge to reduce immigration to tens of thousands. This was the Mail’s coverage of her appearance. https://t.co/AEcLQrLQex\\n(This from the paper that is constantly seeking a clampdown on “health tourism” and better checks to prove that patients are entitled to treatment here.) https://t.co/G2c8Fz1ZRU\\nNow it is gunning for Amber Rudd. People are calling for her to be sacked. The Home Office is a shambles. The PM is “furious”. \\nBut there is one key point the paper hasn’t mentioned: The Home Secretary who introduced the “draconian” immigration policy in 2012 was one Theresa May https://t.co/ukGq1O4PHt\\nOh, and @BhmUK had petitioned the Government about the #windrushgeneration https://t.co/F6inWUR6Fx\\nBy last week @Ameliagentleman had moved on to other cases. https://t.co/5Z1Qgbc7ki\\nEver reluctant to serve compassion unadorned with bile, the Mail reminds us of nasty foreign crooks and illegal immigrants. Then it parks another story alongside about immigrants driving up house prices (which in other circs, the Mail regards as a good thing). https://t.co/84a1Fw41Ii\\nA #Windrush thread\\n\\nTheresa May has met Caribbean leaders to talk about the treatment of the #windrushgeneration. Yesterday Downing Street refused such a meeting. But she’s changed her mind. \\nThe Daily Mail thinks that was because it told her to. It may well be right. https://t.co/scogSpHPJw\\nImmigration is of abiding concern to the Mail. https://t.co/mTiac7yKIu\\nAnd another thing (sorry)\\nThanks to @Wirral_In_It for sending me to Hansard and the 3rd reading debate on the 2014 immigration bill. Here May defends her hostile environment policy and Lab MPs point out the dangers.\\nhttps://t.co/MM1VmSMdu4 https://t.co/CVJMH2ZG1B\\nShe wanted to create a “hostile environment”  – she really used that phrase – for illegal immigrants and those who outstayed their welcome,  making it hard for them to get jobs, healthcare, benefits.',\n",
       " 'COMEY MEMOS: (THREAD) Working my way through the 15 pages of #ComeyMemos. Here are the most important and/or shocking revelations: 1/\\nComey clarified in his memo that they may have understood the phrase \"honest loyalty\" differently. Comey meant loyalty to the office, the country, and the truth. \"I decided it would not be productive to push the subject further.\" #ComeyMemos 13/\\nDuring an undated meeting with Trump COS Reince Priebus, Priebus improperly inquired about FBI\\'s investigation into #MichaelFlynn. Comey told COS that these inquiries should go through DOJ to avoid accusations of improper WH influence over ongoing investigations. #ComeyMemos 15/\\nOnce again denying #GoldenShowersGate, Trump nonsensically added that #Putin had told him that Russia has \"some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.\" #ComeyMemos \\n\\nHey @Franklin_Graham &amp; other #FakeChristians, why was your @POTUS talking about prostitutes w/ Putin? 18/\\nInstead, Trump spent his hour w/ the FBI Director talking about his Inauguration crowd size, White House vs Mar-a-lago accommodations, the 2016 campaign, his son\\'s height, and (again) defended himself against allegations of sexual assault. #ComeyMemos 7/\\nDuring #Comey\\'s 1/6/17 at Trump Tower, @Comey told Trump that the Russians allegedly had tapes involving Trump &amp; prostitutes at a Moscow hotel in 2013. Could these be the infamous #PeeTapes? #ComeyMemos 2/\\nTrump also praised #Comey on 1/6/17 for his handling of the #ClintonEmails investigation. @realDonaldTrump lavished praise on @Comey, indicating that Comey had conducted himself \"honorably\" and had a great reputation. #ComeyMemos 3/\\nTrump directly asked Comey to have the @FBI \"investigate the whole thing [#PeePeeTape &amp; prostitutes] to prove it was a lie.\" (Given Trump\\'s obsession w/ everything gold, it wouldn\\'t be surprising that Trump has a fetish for #GoldenShowers. #AmIRite?) #ComeyMemos 11/\\nWhen Comey mentioned that #Russia had tapes showing Trump &amp; prostitutes, Trump interjected \"there were no prostitutes,\" and them claimed to be the kind of guy who didn\\'t need to \"go there.\" #WRONG! #ComeyMemos 4/ https://t.co/vp6zgQLwI4\\nIn @Comey\\'s memos, he obfuscates any personal responsibility in playing politics w/ the FBI &amp; influencing the election, telling Priebus that \"it also wasn\\'t my fault that #HumaAbedin forwarded emails to #AnthonyWeiner.\" #ComeyMemos 16/\\nWithout prompting, Trump launched into a tirade against some of those accusing him of sexual assault, specifically referencing a particular stripper. Comey told him the FBI wasn\\'t investigating him. #ComeyMemos 5/ https://t.co/oP3rFEbsNK\\nBack to the #PeePeeTape: Remarkably, @realDonaldTrump brought up the #GoldenShowers in a 3rd meeting w/ @Comey, this time in the Oval Office. Trump again obsessed that @FLOTUS might believe the allegation. #ComeyMemos 17/\\nDuring the 1/28/17 meeting, Trump told Comey that he had serious reservations about #MichaelFlynn\\'s judgement. However, Trump continued to keep Flynn on as his National Security Advisor until the media forced his hand. #ComeyMemos 14/\\nOn 1/28/17, Trump held a private meeting with #Comey in the WH. Trump never asked Comey an open-ended question or let him choose the topic of conversation. Shouldn\\'t a new POTUS seek guidance from a seasoned FBI Director on nat sec affairs?? #ComeyMemos 6/\\nDuring that first WH meeting, Trump continued to obsess over #HillarysEmails, going over the sequence of associated events in great detail. After Comey indicated that \"the investigators ALL agreed that there was no case,\" Trump said he disagreed. #ComeyMemos 9/\\n1/28/17 #ComeyMemos: \"[Trump] then returned to loyalty, saying \"I need loyalty.\" I replied that he would always get honesty from me. He paused and said that\\'s what he wants, \"honest loyalty.\" I replied \"you will get that from me.\"\" 12/\\nAfter #Comey emphasized that he was \"not on anybody\\'s side politically and could not be counted on in that traditional political sense,\" Trump stated that he \"needed loyalty and expected loyalty.\" Comey did not reply \"or even nod.\" #ComeyMemos 8/\\nTrump once again brought up the #GoldenShowers \"thing\" and emphasized that it was fake news. Trump obsessed over whether @FLOTUS thought it was true, &amp; then (falsely) claimed that he did not stay overnight for the Miss Universe trip. #ComeyMemos 10/\\nFor a 4th time, Trump brought up the prostitutes subject w/ #Comey, denying meeting w/ any in Russia. \"Can you imagine me, hookers?\" (Uhm, #YESWECAN!) \"I have a beautiful wife and it has been very painful. #ComeyMemos 25/\\nTrump asked whether #Comey agreed w/ his reply during a TV interview that he \"respected\" Putin. Comey criticized Trump for comparing the US to Russia \"b/c we aren\\'t the kind of killers that Putin is.\" Trump didn\\'t take too well to the criticism. #ComeyMemos 19/ https://t.co/AkYA7eUyFO\\nOn 3/30/17, Trump once again clearly attempted to obstruct justice. He explicitly asked what #Comey could do to \"lift the cloud\" of the Russia investigation. He encouraged @Comey to publicize the fact that Trump was not under investigation. #ComeyMemos 26/\\nFinally, on 4/11/17, Trump complained that the #RussiaInvestigation was making things difficult for him &amp; emphasized he needed Comey\\'s help \"b/c I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\" This is more evidence of #ObstructionOfJustice #ComeyMemos 27/\\nunroll @threadreaderapp\\nDuring his rant about leakers, Trump instructed #Comey to talk to AG Sessions about pursuing prosecution of reporters. (Trump is a clear and present danger to our #1A rights.) #ComeyMemos 22/\\nAfter dismissing AG, COS &amp; others from the Oval, Trump once again met privately w/ Comey, this time to talk abt #Flynn. Trump emphasized Flynn didn\\'t do anything wrong vis a vis Russia, but had lied to @VP. #ComeyMemos 20/\\nIn a bold-faced attempt to obstruct justice, Trump, referring to the #Flynn investigation, told #Comey \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\" #ComeyMemos 23/\\nWhen lamenting to #Comey about leaks of his phone calls w/ foreign leaders, Trump observed how the leaked transcripts included things he didn\\'t remember saying. He then said \"they say I have one of the world\\'s greatest memories.\" #ComeyMemos 21/\\n3/30/17 phone call: Trump said \"the cloud of this Russia business\" was making it difficult to run the country. He claimed to have letter from large DC law firm confirming he\\'d received no income from Russia. (Why not just release #TrumpTaxReturns to prove it?) #ComeyMemos 24/',\n",

Whatever goes on at #Epstein island I am fully aware (even if I haven't shared it-you don't need to see, trust me).\\nSo I have been racking my brains all night. I always assumed that the\\nI don't know if I 'feel it' or what it is. But whenever #QAnon posts are up I don't sleep (me up again till 5.a,m last night) nor matter how much I try to ignore them (hence why I haven't continued with #Abramovic, I am exhausted, you guys)\\nThis kept me up most of the night👇Why? https://t.co/LIN4vJnX4V\\n3-Pyramid of evil, the all-seeing eye, the Cabal, the whatever the fuck you want to call them, but the POWER itself, was the Vatican. Not necessarily the #Pope himself (despite the current one being evil), but the #Vatican itself as an entity. I have alway assume the 'eye' to be\\n4-of Horus (so to speak) to be the #Vatican. With the 3 sides of the pyramid being Soros, the Rothschilds (#FlyRothsFly) &amp; SA. Of course all interlinked with Royal Families everywhere. Don't get me started on the actual origins of 'blue blood'. Believe it, there is science to it\\n18-Just a quick note, these ☝️like everything else, prob. didn't stay the same size as meters high we are accustomed to see them in textbooks. Evolving also means shrinking in size. \\nSo who else survived the Earth's strike?\\n2-Giant humanoids, or what we call giants, nowadays\\n23- otherworldly entities (Annunaki, in layman terms), or even before them, what is called among the conspiracists as 'alien astronaut theory'. Whatever you believe, it doesn't matter. The point is chimeras. Ancient chimeras, as such. There is a theory that that is why Muslims\\n12-('leviathan',etc)&amp; a bunch of land creatures that somehow lived the 'darkening of the sun, the gas cloud &amp;the rest of stuff that happened due to the encounter'. Except Humanoids. They were never there.&amp; Dinos died. Deal with it. Common science tells us so. All dead. Don't dig\\n13-One of those meteorites allegedly, parted a portion of the Earth &amp; become the Moon, in time (this is up for the debate). What you need to take from this ☝️is that way many creatures survived that what we are led to believe. Open a few science books &amp; do research to see it.\\n8-Everything I say can be either easily searched (no links) or is all backed by research. I am not lying when I say all the info I was looking for to post on this thread has mysteriously disappear from my computer. \\nBut whatever i am going to say next, I had it backed by FBI/CIA\\n20-All this have been meticulously covered by the Smithsonian. I kid you not. Anything that doesn't fit mainstream science gets hidden away or destroyed. \\nSeriously, ask the Smithsonian sometime to give you a tour of their hidden artifacts, see what happens\\n27-Oh, and one last thing, UFOs. 3 types. more or less 1 = ov.  2=extra dimensional entities (from this world, so to speak). 3= beings from other planets. \\nSo what does all this have to do with the #Vatican, you might ask? Well that is exactly what I was pondering over last night\\n14-Out of this creatures (feel free to call me crazy from here on), &amp; this is where I had all my research save, are a few noteworthy. \\n1- Not all dinos died &amp; a bunch of diff. species survived, cos, guess what? They were smart enough to go underground or hide on caves. Crazy uh?\\n21-So besides those giants I mentioned ☝️there some others (apparently red hair) that I can't remember from my files if they were hidden in the caves of either Pakistan or Afghanistan. But there are many records of soldiers on this &amp; how it takes 10-12 of them to take 1 down\\n11-This can be researched &amp; proved ☝️\\nWe are also told that a giant meteorite (or several, depending on your school of science) hit the earth &amp; all dinos &amp; everything got wiped out. Except for crocodiles &amp; alligators. &amp; a huge number of sea animals (jellyfishes, mastodon...\\n22-Are we good with the crazies❓\\nHere is something else. At some point in history there was a 'garden of monsters'. I believe even the Bible speaks of this (E.von Daniken). More importantly, whether those monsters were created as a result of\\n19-Giants, like humans, were of different species. Some evolved (or devolved, depending on your thinking) to what we call today the squatch (that right?) and yetis &amp; a few others lost tribes around Tibet. Plus a few others I haven't dug on. \\nhttps://t.co/Gg2Xf745Lw\\nOf course\\n5-We know from #Qanon that SA has had a change in leadership &amp; slowly but surely is all going smoothly (women can drive, recognize Israel as state, etc). The Roths are doing #FireSales everywhere &amp; losing power every day. #Sorors is being allowed to operate only to link him to\\n28-So I thought everybody reports to the Vatican, but didn't considered the Vatican to be reporting on anybody else. So who &amp; where? The where is easy. Is the place all the scientist keep dying &amp; all the gov. official meet, inc. Vatican &amp; nobody is allowed to go... for science\\n10-Millions of years ago everything was 'bigger' cos there was more oxygen in the atmosphere (science fact). What is also a fact, is that humanoids lived alongside dinosaurs (again, research) despite the many times common core science tells us this was not the case.\\n17-All this I had backed by FBI/CIA/DHS files + interviews with foot soldiers. ☝️Not a crazy hippy in his mom's basement. \\nSince they managed to survive a bunch of Earth strikes, a bunch of Ice Ages along the way was no issue since they managed to learn to live underground\\n24-don't eat pork. Because pigs are actually chimeras made from our DNA, from us, and as such, they are partly human (hences why organs always fit so well). So in a way, is a form of cannibalism when we eat them. This, of course, is up for debate &amp; speculation. What is important\\n29-Where? South Pole. Where the Rothschilds have their very own island. Where all the climate change gets faked. Do you know that all the freezing subhuman conditions are only in certain locations &amp; some others are warm &amp; cozy?\\n16-I swear to you all I will try to find my lost resources to all this if is the last thing I do ☝️so you all know I am not making shit up.Some architecture around the world (5000 years ago or less will also prove this)Folktales always carry a hint of truth,not matter how small\\n15-Those dinos that didn't die managed to survive to modern times &amp; evolved. You heard that right. They frigging evolved! What I know is that they have feathers &amp; can walk in 2 legs if they want to &amp; have 'primitive' ways of speech (aka,I don't understand them).But they are smart\\n25-Is that at some point in history those chimeras were made,whether by our ancestors,or alien people or whoever. But they do exist (plenty of records of this, too). Even modern science does this (Montauk, Plumb Island, etc). For all of this ☝️I had solid evidence to back it up\\n30-So why are all the power people so concerned with a place nobody is allowed &amp; is cold af &amp; is just 'research' going there? Why are there hundreds of military bases (not research labs, though some) &amp; scientists keep dying when they discover certain things? 🤔🤔\\n6-Other activities &amp; collect evidence to bring all the #MOFOS downs.\\nSo I racked my brains all last night wondering about the #Vatican and my early findings when I first jumped into the #FollowtheWhiteRabbit bandwagon. Some of it I knew before, but a lot of it I find due to anons\\n26-I will check on &amp; try to find those files &amp; add to this thread every now &amp; then.\\nThere are 2 more 'things' I am going to skip over cos I don't have solid evidence for it. \\n1-Hybrid computer that feeds on humans.\\n2-Dark entities/demons/devil/pick one (FBI has lots on this)\\n9-documents. Homeland Security. Files upon files of military personnel (navy, air, land) along with some footage of certain interviews. I promise you guys I will try to find all this info again, or as much as possible, and link it where I can on this thread. But hear me about:\\n7-Tireless research. \\nWhat I am about to say in the next few posts is going to sound batshit crazy to you all.\\nBelieve me when I swear I had 100% all the info to back it all. I swear, on my family, yours, whatever you hold dear.\\nYou know my research skills by now, I do not bs\",\n",

That the NFL should\\'ve given him a team and he doesn\\'t give a *damn* about police brutality either way.\\nThe new Republican talking point—radio, TV, White House—is any critique of conservative public policy is an attempt to \"divide the country.\"\\n24/ Anyone who\\'s upset about \"PC culture\" destroying public debate should be *equally* upset about empty rhetoric destroying the same thing.\\n2/ Let\\'s be clear: the motto of The New Fascism is, \"Don\\'t divide the country.\" It\\'s a way to intimidate dissenters and *end* public debate.\\n20/ I think both Left *and* Right should reject the falseness and cowardice of Trump\\'s \"New Fascism\" and just debate the issues at hand now.\\n10/ Of course, saying what you think allows a debate to unfold. Opting for pure rhetoric instead is a fascistic technique—and has long been.\\n13/ The perverse paradox of Trump is, he wants to be loved but if he ever said what he really thinks he\\'d discover America isn\\'t behind him.\\n7/ We started hearing this New Fascist slogan well before Colin Kaepernick took a knee. The far right uses it on *all* controversial issues.\\nPS/ Actually no, because Trump has yet to take *any* position on police brutality—which is what we\\'re talking about. https://t.co/Cu3D0PbcMe\\n23/ \"Class warfare\"; \"dividing the country\"; \"election butt-hurt\"—one side of our national political discourse collapsed into lame bromides.\\n11/ The best part? Trump\\'s base has *long* had, as its animating issue, the notion that the New Left is squashing public debate and dissent.\\n14/ America *doesn\\'t* support him not caring about policy—it *doesn\\'t* support him using the flag as cover for his vendetta against the NFL.\\n15/ It *doesn\\'t* support him using \"tax reform\" as a cover to enrich himself as he does virtually nothing at all for middle-class taxpayers.\\n18/ That\\'s why I call this \"The New Fascism\": what lies behind it is a fear the far-right position isn\\'t strong enough to withstand debate.\\nPS3/ Afterwards he said, clearly falsely, that it was a joke—further proof he doesn\\'t have the courage of his personal/political conviction.\\n6/ We\\'ve been hearing \"Don\\'t divide the country!\" from Rush Limbaugh, from Donald Trump, from Paul Ryan, from Republicans across the board.\\n17/ The Trump voters I come across online are angry—they *want* to debate police brutality, not spout a \"Don\\'t divide the country!\" bromide.\\nPS2/ Unless, of course, you count him telling a large gathering of police officers that they should definitely brutalize all their suspects.\\n21/ When I hear—say—Limbaugh replace *zero* facility with the facts of the police brutality debate with empty rhetoric, it\\'s just grotesque.',\n",

       " 'For those who are lucky and “only” have to deal with loss of rights the story won’t end there either though. We will be placed on a special register only for EU citizens. Landlords, banks, employers etc will be required to check our status against that with a special number. 13/\\nSo, in sum, we are looking at a very large group of people. People who have contributed to this country, many for decades. They are suddenly being asked to prove their status. In an environment that is hostile and where the onus is on the person under investigation. 19/\\nE.g.: EU citizen wants to rent a flat; there’s 1 other person who also wants to, not an EU citizen. The EU citizen will have to give landlord that special number to check against that special register prior to any agreement. Who will landlord choose all else being equal? 15/\\nWider context is of course this: the strategy of the #HostileEnvironment and the fact that its reach is continuously being extended. I’ve traced the tip of its iceberg here ... the evidence is overwhelming and there is a lot more. https://t.co/0wqhe6HeR5 3/\\n.@theresa_may is actively creating the next Windrush generation. But that is not where it will stop. Never forget that she is not fond of the Human Rights Act either. That will have implications for Britons too. If a government wants to replace a universal Human Rights Act 24/#\\nAuthority, but we don’t know anything much about it. And if our status is not secured through the right legislation it could be changed at any point. #EternalLimbo anyone? 17/\\nBrexit will make the situation worse because the UK government decided to make us bargaining chips in the negotiations. I must be very clear: when @theresa_may and other politicians tell you our rights are now secure and we will be able to live as we do now, they are lying. 7/\\nI was wrong. That too Windrush proved. Because while there has been a big outcry, what has actually improved? More and more devastating stories are coming to light. https://t.co/ma9TmLFOqP 21/\\nto stuff like this https://t.co/tsKK0Rc84X 6/\\nMany of us won’t get to that “best case” outcome, but will fall through the cracks before. There are many questions about eleigibility and having the right records. As simple a thing as a letter in the name could make this fall over if no care is taken. https://t.co/5ac1afIM7b 9/\\nIf you don’t just want to consider my view, look at this for example. But there are quite a few other pieces making similar points. https://t.co/w0DFrJhX8H 2/\\nFor those of us whose settled status application is reject I have particularly significant concerns because of the uncertainty that will cause, the potential for discrimination, and what will happen in light of this terrible move by the government: https://t.co/X15Nj6MsLo 10/\\nSpecial register. Special number. Special checks. Only for us. Nobody else will have to do this. .... Still can’t understand why this is worrying? 14/\\nNow consider the two together: deportation prior to appeal in an environment in which you may not be able, due to the changes to data protection, to ever find out why the application was rejected. That makes an appeal a thousand times harder. 12/\\nThey all strike fear into our hearts because many of us have stories just like these in terms of past life and contributions to this country. All of it meaningless from one day to the next. Still see no problem? 22/\\nSettled status, with all its pitfalls and problems as I set out (and those issues are only the tip of the iceberg) is directly paving the way to future problems. I have no doubt whatsoever that that is deliberate. 23/\\nEU citizens in the UK will be forced to apply for settled status. That status means losing rights. And that is the “best case” outcome: loss of rights for which we have to actively apply...and pay. Otherwise we will become illegal — even though we are here legally now. 8/\\nNow let’s look into the future. That’s where the #Windrush scandal link is the clearest. After 8 years, as per current draft agreement, we will lose the protection of the ECJ. That could well open Pandora’s box with respect to rights. There is meant to be an Independent 16/\\nAs much as I knew the EUref would result in a Leave vote I never saw this coming. Looking at it now I have no idea why. I was just very dumb. I should have known given May’s record. But I guess I believed there was a basic level of decency and humanity in this country. 20/\\nConsider this, for example. This is just plain vicious and unacceptable. How could we ever trust a Home Office that behaves like this? https://t.co/qASXcEFV1Z 4/\\nIn any case the #HostileEnvironment has already reached EU citizens — there can be no doubt. From the significant increase in the number of deportations of the most vulnerable https://t.co/tqsUegbcEA 5/\\nThen there is the case of children—not unlike that of the Windrush children, really.

Son tweet dévoile,s\\'il en était besoin,son intention première:  pouvoir\"liquider\"#Rosenstein no.2 du ministère de la Justice, seul en capacité légale de virer #Mueller...RT https://t.co/EBCAiWnvSY\\nSi j\\'étais le président #Trump-je ne le suis pas-je commencerais la journée par 1 rafale de tweets expliquant à sa base pourquoi je vais laisser publier le mémo #Nunes et en quoi il montre les biais de l\\'enquête du FBI et du procureur #Mueller.Cependant, si imprévisible..à suivre\\n9) #Breaking Le voici donc ce fameux mémo #Nunes à l\\'argument unique: le département de la Justice, par son no.2 Rosenstein, et le FBI ont demandé 1 mise sur écoute de Page, conseiller de #Trump, sur la base d\\'1 rapport Steele financé par les démocrates.https://t.co/yxqBcxWiBF\\n16) D\\'1 part, si le #FBI a lancé 1 enquête de contre-espionnage sur la collusion avec la #Russie grâce à Papadopoulos 2 mois AVANT la demande de mise sur écoute de #Page, c\\'est donc bien qu\\'il avait d\\'autres infos que le rapport de renseignement Steele financé par les démocrates.\\n10) #Breaking Et comme dans 1 chanson populaire célèbre,\"comme de bien entendu\", le président #Trump embraye sur ce mémo #Nunes parlant de honte pour le pays et laissant entendre qu\\'il va virer #Rosenstein (décisionnaire sur #Mueller).https://t.co/huNbjA6bO2\\n#Addendum Le FBI a donc\"fait le job\" contrairement à ce que prétend le mémo #Nunes. Il a informé le juge délivrant l\\'autorisation d\\'écoute sur le conseiller de #Trump qu\\'1 de ses sources était orientée politiquement et que ce n\\'était qu\\'1 de ses sources. Où est donc le scandale?\\n#Addendum #Àvoir #Nunes admet qu\\'il a envoyé 1 autre républicain voir au ministère de la Justice les demandes d\\'autorisation d\\'écoutes sur lesquelles il fonde son mémo...Gênant pour #Trump. https://t.co/MwDLAeN6tx\\n13) D\\'autre part, Page le conseiller de #Trump qui a été mis sur écoute était dans la mire du #FBI depuis...2013, 3 ans avant la campagne et toute info démocrate. Cela décrédibilise fortement le mémo #Nunes. https://t.co/KkbG8kRiXJ\\n17) D\\'autre part, le mémo #Nunes insiste sur le biais partisan anti-#Trump de Strzok, qui a débuté l\\'enquête du #FBI puis a été écarté par #Mueller au printemps 2017 pour sa liaison avec 1 autre agente et leurs SMS moquant Trump SAUF QUE, SAUF QUE...\\n3) Cette info de @politico ce matin explique pourquoi #Trump \"tire le 1er\" contre l\\'enquête du procureur #Mueller. 2 avocats de personnes incriminées dans l\\'enquête pensent que le procureur inculpera le président (qui n\\'a aucune immunité constitutionnelle).https://t.co/JaimBk5Ctc\\n8) #Breaking #Trump passe effectivement en force. Il autorise la déclassification du mémo #Nunes pour discréditer le #FBI et par ricochet #Mueller. On serait tenté d\\'écrire en référence ciné: l\\'opération Zénith 2 a commencé...https://t.co/PnaD16ux7z\\n6) En attendant la publication du fameux mémo #Nunes, normalement dans la journée, 1 nouvel élément à prendre en compte dans le duel #Trump/procureur #Mueller: le président US remonte dans les sondages en 2018 et les républicains rattrapent les démocrates.https://t.co/eRs6239tfm\\n7) #Trump peut être tenté de \"passer en force\" contre le #FBI et #Mueller car la situation économique est idyllique (plein emploi, augmentation des salaires) et sa réforme fiscale devient populaire. Les républicains voulant être réélus se désolidariseront encore moins de lui.\\n19) Car on oublie, et c\\'est vraiment étrange, que si le #FBI a eu 1 rôle partisan effectif, mesurable, dans la campagne 2016, c\\'est de contribuer à la surprise finale de #Trump par la réouverture de l\\'enquête sur les courriels de #Clinton dix jours avant l\\'élection...\\n4) Le procureur #Mueller est de fait bloqué, s\\'il a des éléments contre #Trump. Il sait que le Congrès républicain n\\'entamera jamais d\\'impeachment.1 inculpation,elle, n\\'est proscrite que par ces 2 mémos (1973-2000)des juristes du ministère de la Justice https://t.co/bMtBOwEEo6',\n",

He wasn\\'t going to die of starvation before proper people came to help him.\\n(5) Living out in the middle of nowhere doesn\\'t mean one is completely safe though.  There\\'s these things called roads. People use them.\\n(15) I\\'m no cold hearted asshole. I don\\'t mind helping people. But after years of living in the city, I\\'ve learned to stay away from the drug users, especially when they\\'re tripping out. They\\'re dangerous. Period. To themselves and others.\\n(9) I didn\\'t really think much of it. I figured maybe it was a hiker taking a break in the shade. But I kept it in the back of my mind.\\n(12) Now, mind you, it\\'s been at least 6 hours since my wife\\'s first report that there\\'s a guy hiding in the bushes. So my creepy-radar is pegged. Wtf, right?\\n(6) So despite my childish &amp; irrational desire to ban a tool (roads), I had to accept their existence.  Oh well! \\n\\nAnyway...\\n(19) What? Why was he hiding in the bushes if he had a bike to ride to safety or food?  Weird.  Anyway, he started riding up the road towards our house.\\n(18) He pulled a bicycle out of the bushes and in a fit of rage, threw it in the middle of the road. Then started jumping up and down.\\n(10) An hour later, I have to drive down the mountain to run some errands and sure enough, about a mile down our road is some dude hiding in the bushes.  Weird.  Bah, shake it off. I have things to do.  Drive. drive.\\n(1) Hey howdy! \\n\\nI’m a member of the @NRA \\n\\nApparently some unhinged, emotional children are saying my mere membership to the NRA = I have “blood on my hands”. Hmmmm https://t.co/lCrnWM370F\\n(17) When I got home, I immediately grabbed my phone &amp; my binoculars. Called the sheriff\\'s dept and notified them of the crazy person hiding in the bushes. At the same time I was able to watch him a mile down the road with my binoculars\\n(3) I lived decades in \"the city/suburbs/towns\". As the slow creep of crime &amp; unabated illegal immigration invaded each neighborhood, I moved to keep my family safe.\\n(22) Now, some may argue there\\'s no need for a gun.  Maybe not. Maybe I should just be a victim. Fair enough. My wife wasn\\'t there.  BUT...\\n(11) I spend a few hours down in the valley, taking care of business, and I drive back up the mountain. As I arrive up our road, there\\'s the same dude, only this time he\\'s standing in the middle of the road, blocking my path.\\n(21) So that\\'s when I went back inside, loaded my .45 &amp; put it in my holster. If some wacko was gonna freak out on me, at least I had an equalizer at hand. Were the cops there yet? Nope. Not even close....\\n(4) I want nothing but a clean, safe place to live, work &amp; be part of a decent society. But OTHERS were making that impossible. OTHERS were causing safety problems. I could tell those stories, but it would take forever.\\n\\nSO, I moved out to the country.\\n(20) I couldn\\'t see him any longer, so I walked outside to get a better look. That\\'s when I noticed fresh bicycle tire tracks on my property. WTF? The dude was already at MY HOUSE while I was away? Damn.\\n(23) I consider it my morale obligation to protect her. Part of protecting her, is protecting MYSELF so I can still be around for her.  So dammit, I\\'m going to do just that.\\n(14) I stop, and before I can ask him what\\'s going on, he runs to my door &amp; yells, \"GOT ANY FOOD????!!!\"\\n\\nWhat? \"No, hi, I\\'m stuck. This is my situation\" just yelling &amp; waving arms at me?\\n(8) One morning, on her way to work, my wife called me on her cell phone, \"Down our road, there\\'s some guy hiding in the bushes. Keep an eye on things\"\\n(2) Apparently this is meant to shame &amp; intimidate me into:\\n\\n1. Renouncing my NRA membership\\n2. Giving up my guns\\n3. Joining their \"cause\" of banning others guns\\n\\nLet\\'s see if that\\'ll work. What do you think?  I have a couple thoughts.\\n(13) So I slowly pull up and stop. He\\'s shirtless, waving his arms &amp; has wild eyes. My immediate assessment is the dude is on drugs.\\n(27) In my world, the police is only there to mop up the mess.\\n(24) This story is taking much longer than I anticipated, so let\\'s cut to the ending.\\n\\nThe guy wandered up around our neighborhood and fortunately he didn\\'t come to my house again. He then rode back down the road and finally left our area- HOURS LATER.\\n(26) So basically, unless somebody is ALREADY hurt or a crime is ALREADY committed, the police will never come to our remote area.  That\\'s reality kids.\\n(28) So, do you think I\\'m going to give up my RIGHT to protect my family because an emotional teenager is shaming me? Telling me I have \"blood on my hands\" ?\\n\\nNo. It\\'s absurd. Completely absurd.\\n\\n/end storytime\\n(25) Did the police ever come? NO\\n\\nBut they did call back about 4 hours later. \"We have a deputy that could come up to the area...\"  I replied, \"Don\\'t bother the crazy guy is gone\"',\n",
       " 'She could not identify the groom. He wasn\\'t my dad\\'s dad, and he wasn\\'t my grandma\\'s current husband, a very polite heavily-tattooed Latvian man missing a thumb, named Janus.\\n\\n\"Marion,\" my mother said. \"Who are you marrying in this photo?\"\\nThe reason Papa John got really twitchy in 1987? Well, that was the year Canada announced it was open to stripping citizenship from and deporting war criminals, following the recommendations of 1985\\'s Deschênes Commission.\\n(My dad drove to Toronto and developed a relationship with his dad, we tagged along sometimes and brought him cartons of cigarettes and chocolate bars, etc.)\\nWhen she got back, her parents said that it would be best to just put all that unpleasantness behind her and start fresh. Why bother getting legally divorced when you can just..pretend it didn\\'t happen and move on?\\nOKAY: I am going to tell the story of my bigamous grandmother at the current time. Please mute me if you heard it two years ago. Please do not steal it for an Elite Daily story (happened last time.)\\nAt this point, my mom dialed the number, and handed the phone to my dad. A man answered.\\n\\n\"Hi, do you uh, know Marion A? She had two children?\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been waiting for THIS call for about thirty years.\"\\n\\nYeah, his dad was alive and well and living in Toronto.\\n\"Look,\" says my dad. \"If any human being had the power to get away from my mother, they would have. They would have pushed a kid in front of a bus to do it.\"\\nWe are not clear on why she bothered getting an actual divorce from my dad\\'s dad, since they were never legally married in the first place, her being still married to the British dude, but her ways are dark and mysterious.\\nThis story is very true: names are changed, some details hazy, but all described events and statements are real.\\nMy grandma pursed her lips, and communicated that this story was...unpleasant. Undeterred, my mother pushed on.\\n\\nTurns out my grandmother had married a British soldier during WWII and lived with his family and didn\\'t like them &amp; came home on a troop ship in the middle of the war.\\nLet me now say that I have always been VERY unimpressed with my dad\\'s dad, having a) left him with an actually bananas person and b) the phone works both ways.\\n\\nMy dad, however, who had a truly horrific childhood, has never had a moment of judgment for his dad for this.\\nWhen I was about a year old, my mom decided to do a little family tree for me. My dad had a living mother and a dead father, and my mom asked him what year his father had died. \"Not sure,\" Dad said. \"What did he die of?\" asked my mom. \"No idea,\" Dad said.\\nMy grandfather: \"You remember Carl? He used to drive the ice cream truck?\"\\n\\nMy grandfather drew his last breath. My dad went home and casually asked his sister (who his dad had always seemed disinterested in) if she remembered Carl, who used to drive the ice cream truck.\\nMy grandmother paused for a moment, and then said \"well, I hadn\\'t heard from him in a bit.\"\\n\\nMy mom was like \"so...instead of telling your kids you got a divorce, you told them their dad was DEAD?\"\\n\\nGrandma: \"Divorce is very unpleasant.\"\\nTime passes, life goes back to normal. My mom decides to get back to making my family tree, so she begins sorting through my dad\\'s family photo albums. She finds one of those adorable old wedding photos, w my grandma beaming in a white dress.\\nAt this point, my mother called my grandmother (my mom is from a Talking About Things family, and found my grandmother unbelievably frustrating) and said \"so, hey, great news. Bill\\'s dad is still alive.\"\\nAnna paused, and thought. Then she said \"oh yeah! He was really nice to me. One time he took me to the circus, just the two of us. Weird, huh?\"\\n\\nThank you all for your time.\\n(We discovered, incidentally, that the British soldier had sent her plaintive letters for years along the lines of \"please come back to me, Marion! Where have you gone, Marion!\")\\nMy dad\\'s dad grew old. My father went to be with him in his last days, like a good son. On his last day, my grandpa gestured to my dad: \"I have secrets.\"\\n\\n(I swear even this last part is the gospel truth.)\\nAnd then, we come to the year 1987. I was five at the time. The year is important, but we\\'ll explain why in a minute. The important thing is that my grandmother\\'s current husband (well, again, she was still married to the British dude, but this is Janus) began to get...twitchy.\\nMy uncle Don was working for the government at this point, and she asked him to find a Toronto phone book (Toronto being the most populous city in Canada, and my \"dead\" grandpa\\'s home town.\"\\n\\nOpened to the \"C\"\\'s, scrolled down until she saw: \"Cliffe, [dead dude\\'s first name]\"\\nYou can imagine how little interest my grandmother had in THAT level of unpleasantness (my dad did indeed pass his info on to law enforcement but I believe Papa John was pretty small potatoes in the war criminality department and not worth their time, also...dead.)\\nThen he died, which was very sad. Then my parents went through his stuff, looking for tokens to send back to his family in Latvia. What they found, however, was...unexpected.\\nMy dad, obviously, was like \"can we not?\" but his dad pressed on.\\n\\n\"Your sister, Anna? Not mine.\"\\n\\nMy dad (trying to keep his voice calm): \"WHO IS ANNA\\'S FATHER?\"\\nMy parents did not tell us about that twist until we were grown, at which point I realized why the people I was told by him were The Good Guys had always lost in all those WWII movies we watched together on rainy afternoons.\\nSo, now we\\'re on three husbands, two of them not legally her husbands, one of whom was a middling Nazi war criminal. And yet, there is one more twist in store for us.\\n\"How...do you know he\\'s dead.\" \\n\\n\"My mom said so.\"\\n\\nNow, my mother was VERY familiar with my dad\\'s mother, by this point. We describe her as a person who hated unpleasantness more than anything, but really truly loved drama.\\n\\nNeedless to say, my mom\\'s suspicion was piqued.\\nAnd then, almost overnight, he had a weird personality change. Still real nice to us kids, but he started mumbling a lot. Mostly, something along the lines of \"the Mounties...the Mounties are after me.\" \\n\\nMy parents were like \"o dear, Papa John is getting a bit senile.\"\\nPapa John, as we called him, had always been a good grandpa. I loved to sit on his lap and play with his thumb stump. He liked to do leather work and made us little coin purses. We watched a lot of WWII movies together. He ate a LOT of pickled herring, but never pushed it on us.\\n(checks watch) I mean, I probably COULD tell it now, if the people want me to https://t.co/wHgX5AkuOZ']"
