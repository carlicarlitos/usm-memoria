It was a packed room, and yet no one seemed to see.\\nI say 9 or 10 years old because the truth is I can't remember if it we were ringing in 1990 or 1991. I don't remember if there were 50 people in the room or 100, just that there were a lot. I don't remember his name or really what he looked like. But I do remember his open mouth.\\nI remember the dress I was wearing so clearly in my mind, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn if I was wearing something else entirely. I don't remember where my parents were. I don't remember the music, or what happened earlier in the evening. But I do remember his open mouth.\\nI didn't tell my parents about it, not for years and years. The memory was sickening, but I didn't think it counted as 'real' assault. Just a kiss right? And he was a family friend! I didn't want to cause drama. But I always remembered his open mouth.\\nIf I were, for whatever reason, called on to give evidence about that moment and that night I'm sure even a sub par legal team would be able to rip holes in my testimony. To present me as an unreliable witness, with dates that didn't line up and inconsistent timelines.\\nIt would be easy to do. Because I don't remember everything about just one of the 'inappropriate' things that was done to me as a kid, and I can't recall the exact details of something that happened 28 or 29 years ago. But I do remember his open mouth. I could never forget that.\\nI consider myself lucky in comparison to others. But it boggles the mind to know that 'inconsistency of timelines' is one of the many arguments apologists use to discredit survivors like those of Pell. I don't doubt for a second that man remembered the details that counted.\\nAnd to be clear, I don't categorise what happened to me as even remotely in the same field as what Pell did to his victims. All I'm saying is I know that the kernel of a memory can't be discredited by the wispy details that surround it.\\nAnd a room or environment being 'busy' has never, ever stopped opportunistic predators from abusing people with less power than them.\",\n",

       " 'hilo 103': \"Is cultural appropriation always racist? No.\\nCan we culturally appropriate? Yes. \\nHow do we culturally appropriate? With respect and ethics.\\nSee? That wasn't so hard.\\n\\nFor example: In my novel, THE SYMPATHIZER, I culturally appropriated Ralph Ellison, T.S. Eliot, and Homer\\nIN THE FIRST CHAPTER. I went on to culturally appropriate Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, John Le Carré, Philip Roth, Francis Ford Coppola, and more. \\n\\nI felt I could do so BECAUSE I HAD STUDIED THE WESTERN TRADITION and read and reread the sources I wanted to allude to or\\nappropriate. That's the thing--so-called minorities like myself have to know THE SO-CALLED MAJOR TRADITION, the CANON, and we have to know our own tradition. This is the way cultural appropriation should work. When someone doesn't know a tradition and steals from it or shows it\\ndisrespect--that's negative cultural appropriation. \\n\\nThat doesn't mean there can't be criticism of the tradition you appropriate. See the section in THE SYMPATHIZER on Hollywood filmmaking. I satirized the shit out of Hollywood because I've been watching its good and bad stuff\\nmy entire life. How many people of the majority can claim they've spent their entire lives studying another tradition? \\n\\nA few. I can respect those people as long as they don't claim that they're speaking for another tradition, one that they don't have to live in.\\nLastly, appropriation is not just majority to minority or vice versa. It works across so-called minorities in the same way. I wrote a short story from an African American bomber pilot's perspective in THE REFUGEES. I felt I could do so because I spent a great deal of time\\nreading African American literature and studies, as well as the memoirs of American soldiers and pilots. \\n\\nAppropriation may or may not be right word for every act of borrowing, allusion, or identification. Because I made money off these writing acts, however, appropriation\\nmay be the right word. I took great care in doing so, including studying the ideas and perspectives of my sources. I READ EVERY SINGLE BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA BEFORE I SATIRIZED APOCALYPSE NOW.\\nHow many American directors who have made movies about the war in Viet Nam can say they have read a dozen books from Vietnamese perspectives?\",\n",

In fact, given that it continued long after Trump became president, it would be worse.\\nAdd to that the fact that the Chinese president is supposed to be coming for a summit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the site of the influence selling operation of this Chinese madam/Trump crony/GOP donor, and it all makes for quite the tableau doesn't it?\\nThis story will, we can be certain, contain more revelations.  But it is not just a shocker in its own right.  It is a symptom of one of the many serious ailments with which Trump and his presidency suffer.  His sordid predilections have opened him up to blackmail.\\nEvery foreign government knew that just as they knew they could buy his favor with deals and flattery.  They knew it before he was elected and there is evidence to suggest that the intelligence community heard chatter to that effect.\\nTrump has therefore been a national security liability and, to the extent he allowed himself to be manipulated by those who were willing to deal in this kind of leverage--like the Russians, the Saudis and others--he has put the US at risk and severely damaged the office he holds.\\np.s.

This may mean a new backdoor family or they may move to web shells, tunnelers, using legit creds for VPN/Citrix/cloud services, etc. They may leave their burned tooling or remove it.\\nThe attacker may also go for spray and pray - deploying so much malware that the victim can't keep up, thus buying time to complete the mission. This may require more labor, but doesn't require much depth of tooling. This is a good tactic for smash and grab operations.\\nThe attacker may do both, as in the incident we discussed in #noeasybreach - deploying new and stealthy malware while also mass-deploying known backdoors.\\nOf course, the attacker may pack up and leave, if they have already completed their mission, or if they are very sensitive to being identified or averse to exposing TTPs. Never assume this is the case until you've run down every lead.\\nIn addition to maintaining OPSEC, it is also important to fully scope an incident before attempting remediation.

       " 'hilo 132': '(Thread) Last week @MichaelAvenatti filed a new motion in the Stormy-Cohen-Trump defamation case. Here’s the document:\\nhttps://t.co/LcZLH8CYFQ …\\nHe\\'s trying to depose Trump. Here\\'s an explainer.\\nFirst, the background:\\n#StormyDaniels\\n1/ Oct. 2016: #MichaelCohen worked with Stormy’s lawyer #KeithDavidson to arrange for Stormy to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) \\n[What’s that? See this thread: https://t.co/uPZPG4ztTu ]\\n\\nJan 2018: someone leaked the agreement to the WSJ. Stormy said it wasn\\'t her.\\n2/ Cohen, using “intimidation and coercive tactics, forced [Stormy] to sign a false statement” denying she had an affair with Trump. [Quotations are from her complaint, here: https://t.co/9DgWR7giPN ]\\n\\nCohen then issued a public statement about the hush agreement, prompting. . .\\n3/ . . Trump supporters to unleash a torrent of “ridicule and threats” against Stormy—but she couldn’t defend herself because of the NDA.\\nSo Stormy hired Avenatti and sued to be released from her NDA.\\nCohen (stupidly) moved the case to federal court.\\n4/This gave giving the chance to amend her complaint, so she did: She sued Cohen for defamation. Trump then called Stormy a liar. So she sued Trump for defamation as well. \\nLast month, Cohen won a victory: he told the court he\\'d be pleading the 5th in his criminal SDNY case . . .\\n5/. . .and because of the overlap between the cases, Stormy\\'s case had to be put on hold, or he\\'d be forced to incriminate himself in Stormy\\'s case in violation of his 5th Amend. rights. He got a 3 month stay.\\nBut Trump and his \"lawyer\" Giuliani continued making press statements.\\n6/They made statements like \"the 130K payment was perfectly legal\" and statements about how Trump reimbursed Cohen. (Oops. Trump wasn\\'t supposed to know about any of it.)\\nSo Avenatti\\'s new motion argues that because Trump (obviously) knows everything, as per these statements...\\n7/ Avenatti can depose Trump instead of Cohen, and no need to keep the case on hold. \\n[Twitter Law 101: A deposition is when a party or witness to a lawsuit answers questions under oath as part of the pre-trial evidence-gathering process.]\\nIf the judge grants Avenatti\\'s motion,\\n8/. . . Avenatti would get to depose Trump. \\nPause for a moment to imagine Avenatti deposing Trump ! ! ! \\nNow we wait to see how the judge rules on Avenatti\\'s motion.\\n\\nAvenatti\\'s motion shows the problem with Trump\\'s \"flood the zone\" strategy: It\\'s backfiring in the Stormy case.\\n9/ What do I mean by the \"flood the zone\" strategy?

       " 'hilo 133': 'Illegal is an incorrect and hateful term. And it\\'s especially inaccurate in this context. \\n\\nAllow me to explain. https://t.co/F1cZQmVda3\\nSince people like to bring up following the law, they should probably know what it is, and what it isn\\'t. The federal misdemeanor, § 1325, is improper entry. It\\'s a misdemeanor, not a felony. The law is written as improper (not illegal) entry.\\nIf you\\'re convicted under § 1325 and return without authorization you may then be charged under federal felony, § 1326, for re-entry. That\\'s it. Those are the only two immigration crimes in the United States of America.\\nAs far as I know, no child has ever been tried under § 1325 (or therefore under § 1326). So to write, as so many reporters surprisingly do, that a child entered \"illegally\" is ignorant.\\nBut what about adults who stand accused of breaking the law? Well, when reporters write about people who\\'re charged, we always use words like alleged or suspected. Even when there\\'s video and other clear evidence, it\\'s always alleged until the person in question is found guilty*.\\n*except with it comes to brown people crossing the border. There\\'s an unstated exception, to the point where it\\'s now standard, to use a presumed crime to write that someone is \"illegal,\" it that they crossed \"illegally.\" It\\'s plainly wrong and it\\'s unethical.\\nIt\\'s especially troubling because a lot of the people that you read about who are described as having \"crossed illegally\" haven\\'t even been charged. There isn\\'t even a legal allegation of a crime yet the writing already suggests a conviction.\\nWhen it comes to ICE operations (the pending ones aren\\'t exactly raids, but I\\'ll save that for another day), we\\'re talking about people who have never even been charged with a crime. That\\'s because most immigration law in the United States of civil. Not criminal.\\nThe family members that are reportedly being targeted for removal? My guess is somewhere between 99-100% have never been charged with the federal misdemeanor of improper entry. That\\'s why ICE technically \"detains\" instead of \"arrests.\" Because we\\'re talking about a civil issue.\\nIn fact, some of those family members entered *with* authorization. But the civil law that applied to them may have altered their authorization. Like most things, it\\'s complicated. And using the term \"illegal\" to apply to an entire class of people is not a good thing. Do better.',\n",

Her story is the best one you\\'ll see today summing up what has happened:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/dx1lAyBW6y\\nFor the Epstein case itself, this is a breakthrough because for the first time, a court is confirming Epstein\\'s serial abuse of multiple minor girls (a federal crime) in Florida, elsewhere in the US, and abroad.\\nThat had not been established in court before in part because Acosta, as US Attorney, gave Epstein a non-prosecution agreement for all fed crimes - a deal that extended to all his potential accomplices.  Acosta instead let Epstein plead on *prostitution* charges in state court.\\n(State prostitution charges, really? If you\\'re a grown-ass man doing this to children, is it really the most important thing under the law to know whether or not you also gave the kids money?? Arrrrgh.) Forgive the aside.\\nThe basis for the civil case that led to today\\'s ruling was the Crime Victims\\' Rights Act, which should have *blocked* Acosta from doing this deal in secret with Epstein, without telling his potential victims. \\n\\nHere, Julie Brown sums it up elegantly: https://t.co/sNCoACvYIk\\nToday, as Brown sums it up, the judge ruled that, \"while prosecutors had the right to resolve the case in any way they saw fit, they violated the law by hiding the agreement from Epstein’s victims.\"\\nAnd which prosecutors did that specifically? Was it someone just working below Alex Acosta that he might not have known about? Someone he just didn\\'t adequately supervise on this case? \\n\\nUh, not according to the judge. Read this: https://t.co/OBxcztevut\\nSo, a federal judge just ruled that the current Labor Secretary gave a secret non-prosecution agreement to a prolific, serial child sex offender -- then broke the law by agreeing with the guy\\'s defense team that they\\'d all keep it secret from the victims.\\nDid I mention that Alex Acosta is now a Trump cabinet official?

You are a hypocrite, or you are truthful\\n3. Do what makes you strong. If what you do, follow, believe makes you fragile, you are weak, and you will suffer the consequences of your weakness\\n4. Be in relationships that serve. Both yourself, and the other person. Relationships that are one sided are either exploitive or enslaving. Make yours honorable\\n5. Get your environment in order. What surrounds is always affecting you and creating you. Take control of this, do not be reactive to it.\\n6. Do what is brave, and not what is fearful. Your intuition will always guide you very clearly on this.\\n7. You are responsible for your actions, the consequences of your actions, and the consequences of the consequences. \\n\\nBe conscientious of this phenomena.

You store only changes (called events or experiences) to the model\\n4/ By storing only the changes, you can construct a model that fits real data if you want, but if it no longer works down the line, just throw it away and use the changes to build a new model that fits the data better\\n5/ This allows you to embrace and even be hungry for more data, more events, more change, because changes don\\'t threaten the global model. Your system is anti-fragile, it can handle rapid change\\n6/ For similar reasons, your digital second brain should only store the *excerpts* from sources that you consume, not entire source texts. Save only the parts that inspire or surprise you, because those feelings are signs of a \"change\" in your model\\n7/ Trad\\'l knowledge management was like trad\\'l relational databases, trying to build a comprehensive model of a person\\'s or organization\\'s knowledge base in a hierarchical, rigid format\\n8/ This never worked, not just because knowledge doesn\\'t fit into a comprehensive taxonomy, but because as you approached completeness, your model got more rigid and resistant to change, slowing down your learning, making your knowledge obsolete\\n9/ So knowledge mgmt was inherently self-destructive. But PERSONAL knowledge mgmt puts control of each person\\'s knowledge base in their own hands, and trains them to manage it informally using something like digital notes\\n10/ The informality is key: because you\\'re free to store only fragments, snippets, and pieces of sources residing elsewhere, you have a record of changes that, like in event sourcing, you\\'re free to fit into new models whenever needed\\n11/ This makes change no longer threatening – it is more events to fit into more models.

The position that CNN was wrong to end Marc Lamont Hill’s contributorship over his anti-Semitism is perfectly legitimate and defensible—and is the position I tend to take on such controversies, very much including anti-Israel figures.

If MLH were, idk, an exec at a construction company or something, firing him over his views would be insane and cruel. But that’s not the case here—and indeed he’s not in danger of losing his day job.\\n3. CNN gig is the network bringing him on occasionally to opine on current affairs. His views on current affairs are riddled w/overt bigotry. I also thought Fox was right to banish its guest who made anti-Semitic comments about Soros. No reason to bring the guy back on air. None.\\n4. My views on Fox not bringing back on bigoted pundits are unremarkable. When the same principle is applied to CNN, it’s considered censorious—even though MLH has a far more prestigious and influential place in politics and culture than the Fox guy you don’t even remember.\\n5. And that, one suspects, is one reason for the hypocrisy: leftists think pawns can be taken off the board at will but please leave the bishop alone. That anti-Semites are considered so valuable to liberalism (the Forward defense of Sarsour et al) is a chilling admission.\\n6. The second reason is the nature of the comments. He did not call some Jewish guy greedy or scheming or whatever. No dog whistles. He used the single most famous genocidal anti-Israel call to arms in existence. To a room full of states who take such action!\\n7. And in the same speech, he told a room full of representatives of terror-supporting anti-Semitic states to *ignore calls for nonviolence regarding the Jewish state.* I think it’s kind of getting lost just how completely psychotic his speech actually was.\\n8. When he concluded with the famous genocidal slogan, the entire hall was electric with enthusiastic applause. It was like watching a between-the-wars Bavarian beer hall times a hundred.\\n9. But there’s a key difference: it wasn’t just a hall of angry people. It was a hall of representatives of countries around the world, at the headquarters of the world body, with that body’s imprimatur. \\n\\nHave you completely lost your goddamned minds?\\n10.

Second, US conservatives will ramp up their demagoguery around \"eco-terrorism.\" As it becomes clear that the GOP simply won\\'t allow a small-d democratic solution, desperate young people are going to turn to direct action. The GOP will use that to justify repression.\\n5. And be clear: as climate gets more &amp; more chaotic, and the ambient sense of threat &amp; uncertainty rises around the world, these kinds of reactionary responses will gain *more* public appeal, not less. Threat &amp; uncertainty make everyone more conservative.\\n6. So the US is at a crucial juncture, one that reflects a larger global dynamic: the space for addressing climate change in a cooperative, mutually beneficial way is rapidly shrinking. From here on out, circumstances will bolster the forces of reaction.\\n7. That\\'s why the situation in Oregon is freaking me out. I thought we had at least a little time left in which the mechanisms of democracy could still work. But the fossil-funded white minority is openly, nakedly rejecting democracy &amp; it looks like they\\'ll get away with it.\\n8. The right will see that it worked &amp; it will rapidly become standard practice, across states, maybe federally. (If you think the rules are different in different states, so it wouldn\\'t work, you are still hung up on thinking rules matter.)\\n9. That would mean the end of any chance of the US addressing climate change through peaceful, mutually beneficial, democratic means. Oregon Ds elected majorities, then super-majorities ... now they\\'re supposed to accept that success is only possible if they vote EVERY R out?\\n10. If democratic means become impossible, what\\'s left is violence. There may be some radical climate activists who think they\\'re ready for that, but guess what? The reactionaries will always have more guns &amp; fewer scruples. The forces of decency will never win that fight.\\n11. Basically, this is future-of-the-species stuff, getting decided through a spectacle that\\'s barely even able to break into the daily news cycle. And the next time around, there may not even be the pretense of democracy. We are truly headed into the shit. &lt;/fin&gt;',\n",

I vividly remember reading it in high school as my own-choice independent novel which I was then required to write an essay about.\\nWhat is coming back to me quite clearly as I watch the show adaptation is how frustratingly real and fallible I found both characters. I feel that they’ve captured that quality of their dynamic at this early part of their relationship quite well.\\nThey’ve never lived together. They’ve barely shared space for more than a week or two at a time. They lived on different continents! Roger hasn’t yet learned that Brianna pushes away when she really wants people to stay in an argument (to his credit he DOES learn this).\\nFurthermore, Bree is a terrible communicator who hasn’t yet learned that Roger will always follow through on his word and commitments. (She grew up an only child remember, with two parents who actively didn’t communicate about certain things as role models.)\\nNavigating these minefields of communication is part of why the novels are so great: You can read each characters inner monologue and understand their point of view even if it makes you all “GAAAHH!!!” https://t.co/q3cEKWOOn4\\nThe ongoing difficulty of adapting these novels for tv is that inner monologues—by necessity of medium—have to become dialogue, Outer Monologue, or visible. And there’s only so much of that which can be communicated in 1.25 hours. Given these strictures, I’m so impressed by\\n@RikRankin @SkeltonSophie the writing &amp; directing teams &amp; the crew for how they’ve distilled these fraught and psychologically dense developments for the screen.\\nI didn’t come to love them as a couple in the books until well into Breath of Snow and Ashes. They had some growing up and learning to do before they could truly function well as a couple. That’s Real. It’s hard to watch because we always want to skip to the happily-ever-after\\nKnowing how things turn out makes it easy to second guess their reactions and choices. But they’re BOTH operating under mid-20th century expectations of personal privilege in 18th-century conditions. Those expectations fail them both spectacularly.\\nMy understanding is that a component of how Herself writes is to explore the ramifications of events and choice upon each character through their own lense. Throw something at them and engage with how they respond.\\nHow Roger and Bree respond to this pivotal 24hr period in their lives shapes literally everything after. How they got there isn’t actually the point, what they do next IS. /fin',\n",

You can not like the word \"cunt\" for feminist reasons; you can--&amp; should!--think about why a term for female anatomy is such a potent pejorative. But use of it in this context is not reinforcing or replicating the crude harm it has been used to inflict historically...\\n4. ie the patriarchal diminishment &amp; vilification of women. In fact, Bee is using it to critique a woman precisely because that woman is acting ON BEHALF OF THAT PATRIARCHY, one which systematically diminishes women, destroys families, hurts kids, especially non-white.\\n5. It is fundamentally different from Roseanne comparing Jarrett to an ape, a racist locution w deep racist roots, bc unlike Bee\\'s deployment of cunt AGAINST a misogynistic, racist administration, Roseanne\\'s racism is deployed IN SUPPORT OF a racist, misogynistic administration..\\n6. that came to power in part on racist &amp; misogynistic rhetoric that vilified &amp; promised revenge against Obama administration of which Jarrett was a member &amp; which is using the power it so gained to inflict real world racist &amp; misogynistic harm on human beings.\\n7.

This also applies, of course, to faux-offense at Michelle Wolf, to cowering hobbits of the dark web &amp; to idea that metoo is a witch hunt and its critics have been unjustly silenced. NONE of that is real. NONE OF IT.\\n9.

In reality these claims can take much longer. https://t.co/eLfq0N69xn\\nHow many asylum claims are granted?\\n\\nA: approximately 44% of total asylum claims filed are granted.

Applicants have 16 days to respond to a notice of intent to deny and provide additional facts to support their claim. https://t.co/0mdgXbU7pQ\\nWhat happens when asylum (including all available appeals up to and including SCOTUS) is denied?\\n\\nA: Removal proceedings are initiated and barring some other claim of eligibility (they exist) the applicant is deported.\\nAre asylum seekers criminals paid by Soros to ruin America?\\n\\nA: No. Asylum seekers are human beings fleeing horrific, deadly violence.

Even if you like their “support for Israel” (I don’t, it’s pro-Occupation), you are cannon fodder to them. 1/x https://t.co/m90tqOaisx\\nWhat fascinates me is the ultra-Orthodox Jews who ally with them, which I think can be read as both groups using each other. Christian Zionists thinking the Jews will help hasten the Rapture and they’ll get zapped, that’s fine.\\nJews thinking, like, obvs the Rapture won’t happen, but this is great for helping Israel make the Occupation permanent (and, depending on their theology, maybe will hasten the Messiah-who-is-not-Jesus coming and they don’t really care where non-Jews fall in that equation.)\\nAnyway. Christian Zionists often appropriate our stuff and make Big Jewish Noise but they are not our friends, do not wish us well. (NB Christian Zionism is a movement, a thing, I don’t mean just “Christians who happen to believe the State of Israel should exist in whatever way”)\\nThey wish us ill, they wish queers and trans folks and probably most POC ill (never mind Jews who are also queer &amp;/or Black etc etc), they, unlike the guy they claim to follow, do not bring love and compassion to the world. \\n\\nThey are dangerous &amp; they are running this country.\\nFor those of you talking about how some Jews will be \"saved,\" aka convert to Christianity, won\\'t get killed--my friends, you misunderstand if you think that\\'s better. It\\'s roughly same difference viz valuing Jews and our humanity, autonomy, faith.  We only matter if we convert.\\nWe have a whole martyrology literature around “sanctifying God’s name,” aka preferring death to forced conversion.\\nThe Yom Kippur liturgy incl. language specifying explicitly that we’ll let those who pretended to convert under duress to pray with us--bc it wasn\\'t obvious that the answer was yes. In fact, the Kol Nidre prayer may be a formula to annul those conversions. “Saved” isn’t better.\\nWe didn’t survive the Inquisition and the Crusades and all those expulsions and pogroms and the Holocaust just to give up at this so-called end. Not gonna happen. \\n\\nEnd of the world can come &amp; go &amp; there’ll still be a couple of Jews somewhere in some corner studying Torah.\\nI\\'ll say this again, more slowly, here: #NotAllChrisitians are trying to manipulate Jews to bring the end times and don’t care if they’re obliterated (whether death or conversion) in the process. I’m talking about a very. specific. movement. here. Christian Zionist Evangelicals.\\nThis eschatological theology we\\'ve been discussing depends on supersessionism, which is inherently antisemitic.  But also this particular branch of toxic Christian Zionist Evangelicals is also not the only place where supersessionism/replacement theology shows up.\\nSo if you are Christian and reading this thread it would be a good and helpful form of allyship to Jews to interrogate the places where it might show up in your own community\\'s thinking, and to do some grappling with that.

How does it start?\\n\\nYou\\'ll get a DM from someone on your friends list, in a groupchat with you, and/or with mutual servers.\\nDON\\'T CLICK (obviously)\\n\\nThe DM seems to have multiple forms. I\\'ve seen two so far, if someone\\'s seen more, please do share: https://t.co/D153PiZ6T6\\n2. What is the link exactly?\\n\\nThe link is made to look like a legit Discord link--it\\'s not. It has Discord\\'s embed forged, and if you read the link closely, it\\'s not \"discord dot gg\" as Discord uses; rather, it\\'s \"discord gg dot ga\". This is meant to trip you up into clicking. https://t.co/7z7QRb2rQl\\n3. Where does the link lead to?\\n\\nThe link will take you to a fake login page. This is intricately forged to look EXACTLY like Discord\\'s plain login. The trick is that you think it\\'s a legit Discord login, so you put in your email &amp; pass like normal, thinking all is good till now.\\n4. What happens then?\\n\\nYour account is taken. In reality, you just gave your email &amp; pass to the system running this shit--and before you know it, a bot is now in your account. It locks you out by changing your pass &amp; email, so without 2FA you\\'re not getting back in anytime soon.\\n5. What does it do on my account?\\n\\nExactly what it did to you using your friends\\' account(s). The bot goes through your friends, DMs, server members, and groupchats, sending the same messages in hopes of tricking more &amp; more people &amp; gaining control of more accounts over Discord.\\n6. Why is this such a big deal?\\n\\nDiscord accounts hold a lot of info!! I\\'m sure a lot of people reading this have things on their account they wouldn\\'t want even friends seeing, let alone a virus.\\nAlso, for server staff &amp; owners, this means SERIOUS danger. Scary shit can go down.\\n7. I got the virus and my account is sending the link everywhere. What do I do?\\n\\n--Make a new account with a familiar name+pfp\\n--Reach out to as many trusted people from your old account (friends, server staff, etc.)\\n--Look for invites online of servers you were in that you trust\\n7. (cont)\\n\\n--In servers, reach out to trusted staff &amp; friends. Explain what happened calmly. Maybe have some way of proving it\\'s you\\n--Get a friend to help vouch to server staff/others that you really are you\\n--Ask for help getting in touch with other friends &amp; their Discord tags\\n8. I know/am friends with someone with the virus. What do I do?\\n\\n--Remove their old acct from all groupchats (see who\\'s group owner, they can remove)\\n--Unfriend &amp; tell others to unfriend\\n--Save anything you need from y\\'all\\'s DMs\\n--On their new acct, HELP them reach out to friends https://t.co/NEXddIi2Jr\\n9.

They often have more faith than sense. 3/12\\n⛏️ Willingness to toil\\n\\nBeing early means not having the luxury of easy capital. It usually means an endless stream of tough pilot projects &amp; test deployments. Grabbing revenue wherever it can be had. It\\'s hard, often demoralizing, but necessary. 4/12\\n⚙️ M-A-N-A-G-E-M-E-N-T\\n\\nVC-backed startups often have a laissez faire mode of management, but these founders believe in it and invest in it. They’re not micromanagers, but they do try instrument the business from its earliest days. Their survival depends on it.\\n\\n5/12\\n💊 Pain tolerance\\n\\nThese founders lose key hires to better-funded, higher-profile startups. Competitors raise more money and grow faster (until their faulty models fail). Family asks these entrepreneurs when they’re going to get a real job? \\nIt can be painful. \\nFor years. 6/12\\n🔥 Cheerleading\\n\\nI\\'ve been involved with a company in this mold for 14 years. TBH, I nearly wrote it off multiple times in the first six years. But whenever I got close, the founder reignited my excitement and did the same for the team. A true super power. 7/12\\n🏖️ Perspective\\n\\nThe difference between a $100M exit and a $1B exit is often just a three-week vacation. Some founders get burnt out after a decade of struggle and take the 1st credible offer for their startup. Just as their growth is about to go exponential. 8/12\\n🃏 Reputational risk tolerance\\n\\nAll startups are risky. But there\\'s a big difference between spending two years at a startup that fails and 10+. These founders define \"all-in\" and leave little room for \"pivoting\" their personal brands. 9/12\\nIt\\'s hard to spot these entrepreneurs. Aside from being \"too early\", many of these traits only present themselves well into the journey, but we should be more mindful about supporting them as they develop. 10/12\\nThese companies are often the least flashy in a portfolio. Because they rarely incite early bidding wars and can raise capital on their own terms later in life, they can also be hugely remunerative to founders and investors alike. 11/12\\nBeyond the financial consideration, these startups are intrinsically rewarding in the extreme. In an industry that includes jargon like \"flips\" and \"quick wins\", seeing a founder\\'s true vision come to life is so extremely gratifying. 12/12',\n",

When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution, the Rule of Law—the foundation of liberty—crumbles.\\nWe’ve witnessed members of Congress from both parties shift their views 180 degrees—on the importance of character, on the principles of obstruction of justice—depending on whether they’re discussing Bill Clinton or Donald Trump.\\nFew members of Congress even read Mueller’s report; their minds were made up based on partisan affiliation—and it showed, with representatives and senators from both parties issuing definitive statements on the 448-page report’s conclusions within just hours of its release.\\nAmerica’s institutions depend on officials to uphold both the rules and spirit of our constitutional system even when to do so is personally inconvenient or yields a politically unfavorable outcome.

Finagle or Hystrix are great choices. Are you an all Go shop? Try something like Micro. Are you polyglot? You can either plow a ⛰️ of resources into custom libraries in every language, or you can embrace the sidecar. Solutions must be found.\\nBut remember, VERY few companies get here. Make damn sure you need the networking complexity you are about to take on, because no matter what the vendors/conferences tell you, there will be pain, and nothing comes for free.\\nIs it always going to be this way? I don\\'t think so. I actually think we are in a bridge period in which the average engineer has to directly interact with technologies like Envoy and K8S to succeed at SoA.\\nI am a firm believer that in the 10 year timeframe, FaaS is all anyone will interact with.

       " 'hilo 196': 'THREAD: I want to take a moment to elaborate why we should be so concerned that Jim Clapper, John Brennan, Admiral McRaven, Mike Hayden, and other officials feel it necessary to speak out against Trump:\\n1) Lost amid the controversy last week about Trump yanking Brennan\\'s security clearance is just how unusual it is for any of these officials to be speaking publicly—and that fact alone should be cause for concern....\\n2) This is no ordinary political criticism. Do not fall into Trump\\'s trap that this is just more of the same, more partisan sniping from the Swamp from swamp creatures....\\n3) These officials are not—repeat not—monetizing their security clearances by being on cable TV. In fact, having covered many of these officials for years, I can tell you that they would prefer to be doing anything but being on TV.\\n4) What they are doing is offering the clearest warning they can, speaking—as intel officials are supposed to do—truth to power, telling hard truths, that America faces a dire situation.\\n5) I spent months profiling Jim Clapper when he was DNI; back then, he went out of his way to say nothing, to avoid controversy, to eschew politics, to focus on the work before him. https://t.co/yALqFbVHDt\\n6) All of them would have preferred to sit on the sidelines of politics. They spent their careers avoiding it and would prefer to remain off the public radar.\\n7) All Clapper wanted to do when he left office was slip quietly into the night and clean out his basement. He\\'d been retired before—for six years—and never did TV commentary or cable news before. But those were \"normal\" years, under Clinton and W.\\n8) Altogether, Clapper spent nearly 50 years in public service. Hayden did about 40 years. McRaven 36. Brennan too, more than 30. These are not partisan hacks. They don\\'t scare easily. They don\\'t cry wolf.\\n8) All of them were trained to keep quiet on politics. So the fact that they\\'re not silent, that all of them—all of them—are screaming from the rooftops about Trump\\'s threats to our country, our rule of law, our democratic institutions, should chill us. https://t.co/tzEvZlf5jI\\n9) I was there last summer at @aspensecurity as Clapper and Brennan let loose on Trump. I was gobsmacked. I had read every word Jim Clapper has said in public in a decade. I had never imagined I\\'d hear him speak as ominously and fearfully as he did. https://t.co/Se8XRqFhJd\\n10) I remain stunned by the words and warning that come from Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, McRaven, and others today.\\n11) They are telling us this is a dark and dangerous time. And they have spent their lives, devoted their entire careers, to protecting the country from just these sorts of events overseas. That they\\'re warning us we\\'re under threat at *home*.

Even though in the Flynn memo it clearly states that the criminal investigation is separate from the Mueller Russian interference SC.\\n\\nFolks, Mueller found something.\\n5) But what he found had fallen outside the scope of his investigation, which was specifically “Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election”. \\n\\nMueller found this in his 19 interviews with Flynn in which Flynn was required to give knowledge of “any and all crimes”. https://t.co/tRh8sRqC3z\\n6) General Flynn, white hat/Q team, knows a plethora of crimes ranging from Uranium One to the Weiner Laptop.\\n\\nWhen we talk about “legal injection” this is what we mean.\\n\\nFlynn purposefully caught a minor process charge so he could testify about EVERYTHING!\\n\\nHUGE Q PROOF! 👇🏻 https://t.co/bmyH096Ght\\n7) What Mueller said in this presser confirms what was already in the documentation. He found crimes, and those crimes were handed off to other investigators. \\n\\nWhen he says “a process that does not involve our office”, I cannot confirm who he is referring to. Huber? Durham? Idk.\\n8) What I do know is that if Flynn gave Mueller all crimes with which he was familiar, and those interviews assisted in multiple ongoing criminal investigations, and those investigations are SEPARATE from the Mueller/Russia SC, THAT LEAVES ONE POSSIBILITY.\\n\\nThe other side. #PAIN https://t.co/3EJkQuMaYl\\n9) This is huge. This confirms everything. This confirms Mueller was conducting a fair investigation and looked into matters on both sides.\\n\\nNow the SC is done, Trump team is clear, and the ongoing criminal investigations with sitting grand juries continue to work in the shadows.\\n10) So the options are:\\n\\nMueller is a white/grey hat who investigated both sides.\\n\\nOr \\n\\nMueller is a black hat, running a coup from within Trump’s own DOJ, yet failed to damage Trump and accidentally investigated his own side.\\n\\nHe’s either a white hat or the worst black hat ever.\\n11) This is the reason I am so calm and so confident in the situation is because I know the legality and I know that there are multiple ongoing criminal investigations into the other side and Mueller assisted in these findings. \\n\\nMueller is our guy. He has been since 5/17/17.\\n12) In summary, We got a member of Q team (Flynn) to testify about all crimes with which he was familiar and Mueller handed it off to other criminal investigations.

Today is my daughter\\'s birthday.\\n2/ I never mention her name or location on social media, I am scared to death that someone will touch her and it hasn\\'t changed much for the past 30 years. I told Roger that I remembered seeing many copies of her, except they were Kurds, when Saddam Hussein attacked them.\\n3/ All those little dead bodies were copies of my baby and the shock of seeing that was harder than dealing with real children in extreme poverty in the slums of Brazil. I held many. I wasn\\'t a mother yet, though.\\n4/ Later on, when she was about 7 or 8, we stopped for bathroom and drinks on our way to see my sister. We lived in Blacksburg, VA where I was a visiting scholar and the road crossed the Apalachians.\\n5/ We stopped at this place where a dozen men wearing hats and women on flowery dresses turned their white heads to look at my brown child. The alarm reactions kicked in instantly. A mother will kill to protect her baby.\\n6/ When she was about to be born, I threatened the physician. He was trying to get me to accept the common maternity baby room when we had an agreement that I was in the common room program (mother and child in the same room).\\n7/ He was scared. My daughter\\'s father was scared. Then she was born and they put the crib a few feet from my bed. I forced them to put it right next to it. My baby - my rules. I also remember paranoid thoughts about what to do if somebody tried to steal her.\\n8/ \"Is it possible to insert a chip in the baby\\'s body so that we can locate her at any time?\" People looked at me a bit scared. This lasted just a couple of days. I didn\\'t let people hold her except my close family. I didn\\'t allow visits during the first month.\\n9/ Then, during the last Carnaval, the fascist police attacked her party block in Brazil. She was hurt. The policemen were put on leave and the district is being sued. They will lose. Good. But that day and the days that followed, I felt helpless and desperate.\\n10/ When I see the cages at the South border, all the kids look like my baby to me. Why? No clue. The image of innocent refugee children murder, the little girl with a pink blouse, looks exactly like my baby. I can see her.\\n11/ That\\'s the alterity shock. The victim is you, or, worse, your child. You need to do something about it. And yes, that also comes with anger, powerlessness and hate: I hate the ICE agents. I know that I wish they were hurt.\\n12/ I am a good social scientist. The USCIS agreed with this, too: I have the whore-visa.. oops, sorry, the EB-1A visa (the one Melania screwed up for us). I know that the proper definition is \"concentration camp\".\\n13/ It goes beyond that, though. I will think about my baby the whole day today. It\\'s her birthday. Yesterday was the funeral of a boy who killed himself here in Red America. It was also supposed to be the terrorist ICE raid against immigrant families ordered by Trump.\\n14/ The empathy shock creates dark thoughts in my mind.

On Aug. 4, 2016 Stone sent an email to Nunberg and said \"I dined with Julian Assange last night,\". The WSJ has a copy of hte email. Now the gaslighting nutjob liar is saying \"The email means nothing bc I didn\\'t go\". Good luck with that.\\n3. Stone is all \"I never dined with Assange, the email doesn\\'t have any significance. This was said in jest\" Sure, Jan. Explain that to Mueller.\\n4. Kindly note: Mueller\\'s team has asked about Stone\\'s email during testimony before a Grand Jury.

So yeah, not buying it. And also, the below. LOL.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/ILQ9SXVa2I\\n6. And let\\'s not forget Stone has been widely inconsistent in his statements about WIkiLeaks and Assange. Not to mention the day after the dinner he is laughably trying to deny, Stone tweeted: \"Hillary lies about RU involvement in DNC hack - Julian Assange is a hero\".\\n7. THREE DAYS after that, Stone told a GOP group in Florida that he had communicated with ASsange, and that he believed more damaging docs about HRC would be released in months to come. \"There\\'s no telling what the Oct.

It appears evident he communicated with Assange, and we KNOW he did with Russian GRU Guccifer.\\n9. The point here is cooperation or rather conspiracy between Trump Associates and Russia. Kind reminder that WIkileaks even per Trump lackey and Putin stooge POMPEO is nothing but a Kremlin front.\\n10. So whether Stone went to dine with Assange in person, used Whatsapp to chat, Skype or whatever else, the result is the exact same. That\\'s cooperation and conspiracy with the Kremlin to spread stolen material in order to influence the election.\\n11. Days before Stone\\'s claim to have dined with Assange, the WSJ notes, Trump himself called upon Russia to steal and release Clinton\\'s emails (there, I fixed it for you WSJ).\\n12. Stone is all \"I neeevah evah talked about Wikileaks disclosures with Trump!\". That\\'s right, bozo, you discussed the strategy to release them and how to get them, not the disclosure per se.\\n13. Another kind reminder that Stone is so foolish as to have posted screenshots of Twitter DMs he exchanged with Guccifer, meaning the GRU. I mean we know Stone isn\\'t the brightest or most stable person, but this is a peak of foolishness evn for him.\\n14. To conclude, when Mueller\\'s GJ asks about an email referencing dinner with Assange, they\\'re looking for ANY possible confirmation of contact, not just that contact specifically. So, Stone?

Prigozhin named Utkin to Concord Management's board of directors. #SudanUprising\\nUtkin recruited Ukrainian soldiers and sailors to work for the Wagner Group in Sudan, in exchange for Russian citizenship.

These paramilitary forces spy on peaceful protestors. #SudanUprising\\nThe Wagner Group also guards Sudan's gold mines, diamond mines, and uranium mines, as well as the atomic energy facilities which Russia is building in Sudan. Bashir has given Prigozhin and the Wagner Group ownership interests in Sudan's mines. #SudanUprising\\nOn paper, it initially appears that Sudanese companies own the gold, diamond, and uranium mines in Sudan. But when you investigate, you find that the Sudanese companies are actually owned and controlled by Prigozhin's Russian companies, such as M Invest. #SudanUprising\\nSudan's dictator Bashir has given the Russian organized crime boss Prigozhin and his Wagner Group thugs the gold, diamond, and uranium mines that represent the natural heritage of Sudan's youth. And Russia is building a military base in Port Sudan. Tasgut bas. #SudanUprising\\nThis is Yevgeny Prigozhin. This is the face of Russian colonialism in Sudan. This is the man who owns Bashir.

I am not a solar-power hater. I am something much worse. I am a Green who can do math. (!) https://t.co/DoE2dvvYMB\\n2/\\nSolar power faces a series of daunting technical challenges:\\n\\nFirst, high solar intensity. The enemies of intensity are humidity, low altitude, high latitude, and slope.\\n3/\\n\\nSolar intensity is much higher at elevation, humidity generates light reflecting haze/clouds, high latitudes introduce massive seasonal variation, and slope vastly reduces area available for panels.\\n4/\\n\\nThe red zones are the only places where solar intensity is sufficiently high for panels to make economic sense without massive subsidies. \\nThe red and orange are the locations where it makes environmental sense. https://t.co/qqPOTAdvf0\\n5/\\n\\nSecond, proximity. Transmitting power more than about 500 miles means a load loss of ~10%. The dots on the map represents cities. If the dots aren’t close to a red zone, transmission lost kills solar as a useful input. https://t.co/fn8so64Amb\\n6/\\n\\nThird, intermittency. Between haze/clouds, seasons, and night, solar is unreliable - and we all need on-demand power. In most locations the sun shines during periods of low power demand, while high power demand occurs after sunset.\\n7/\\n\\nLithium is often floated as a storage mechanism, but it does not charge or discharge fast enough, nor does it store enough electricity.\\n8/\\n\\nLithium paired with solar in the green areas actually increases your carbon footprint because you will never generate sufficient electricity to overcome the sunk carbon cost of producing the system in the first place.\\n9/\\n\\nThat leaves most people with a fourth problem: fuel pairing. Since a coal plant takes a full day to spin up and down, it never turns off even when the sun is out. 😠\\n10/\\n\\nThe great lie of green power is that it counts any solar-generated electricity as part of the mix, even if we don’t use that electricity due to low momentary demand, or if we never turn off our coal power plant. 😳\\n11/\\n\\nIn the German and Chinese cases specifically, the paired fuel is typically soft coal or lignite, so in most cases their carbon emissions have gone UP because of their solar commitments. \\n(Btw, pairing w hydro is great if your geography allows it)\\n12/\\n\\nCollectively, this means that unless you are in the red zones AND between the dotted lines on this graphic, solar is at most a fringe contributor to your power needs. And if you are in the green zones solar actually makes your net emissions worse. https://t.co/M4dDb4NsPy\\n13/\\n\\nwhich means we have a very long way to go if the goal is actually to eliminate carbon emmissions. The green technologies we have today just cannot do it.

       " 'hilo 214': '1. Is there any reason for hope?  I suggest there is. I want to return to Tuesday’s court hearing. Trump’s lawyer argued that Congress cannot issue subpoenas to investigate presidential violations of the law.  Judge Mehta plainly and inarguably disagreed with that position. . .\\n2. Without recounting every observation by Judge Mehta, he made it crystal clear that it’s proper, indeed necessary, for Congress to investigate presidential violations of statutes, presidential violations of the Constitution (the judge specifically mentioned . . .\\n3. the emoluments clause) and presidential conflicts of interest (the judge referenced a president having a financial interest in the legislation he supports or other actions he takes while in office). Indeed, it was so obvious that Judge Mehta would rule . . .\\n4. against Trump’s position &amp; in favor of the House Oversight Committe’s position that, at the end of the hearing, Trump’s lawyer said as much (asking the judge to stay/delay his order from taking effect until Trump’s lawyer could appeal the ruling he expected to go against him).\\n5. Just yesterday, the White House Counsel issued a letter essentially taking the same (losing) position that Trump’s lawyers took in court on Tuesday. Why do I interpret this as a hopeful sign?  Because, IMO, the state of our judiciary remains strong. Notwithstanding . . .\\n6. the administration’s obvious stonewalling, these matters will move into and be resolved by the courts. After 30 years, appearing before more than 100 judges, I firmly believe that our judiciary remains dedicated to the rule of law. Even more importantly . . .\\n7. the judiciary will not endure or endorse a criminal president or a corrupt administration. Now, we’re rightly concerned about the packing of the courts with conservative judges. But every conservative administration appoints conservative judges, so this is nothing new . . .\\n8. With the black robe and life tenure comes great independence. Yes, these conservative judges likely will remain ideologically conservative. But that does not mean they will side with a criminal president or a corrupt administration. I don’t want to sound cynical, but . . .\\n9. The judiciary likes to assert its authority over the executive branch. When both Nixon and Clinton made arguments that suggested a president is above (or beyond the reach of) the law/the judicial system, the Supreme Court shot them down.  Put another way . . .\\n10. The judiciary understand (and jealously guards) its authority and responsibility to remain a vitally important check on lawless behavior by the president and the executive branch.  These stonewalling tactics ultimately will fail, with the courts ruling against Trump. . .\\n11. and in favor of Congressional oversight and investigative authority. When given the opportunity, the courts WILL hold this criminal president accountable. It won’t happen quickly, though I believe the courts will move these matters through the system on an expedited basis...\\n12. Indeed, Judge Mehta articulated that these matters need to be given ‘most expeditious treatment when one branch of government is holding up the work of another’ (paraphrasing). Judge Mehta exemplified the fidelity to the law that inspires confidence in our judiciary . . .\\n13. Let’s be real, this battle between a lawless administration and a rule-of-law judiciary will continue for some time. Unfortunately, many of our elected officials in Congress have chosen to side with a lawless president. History will will not treat those politicians kindly...\\n14. So all of this is to say that it won’t come quickly, it won’t come easily, it won’t come painlessly, but Tuesday’s court hearing is an encouraging sign that #JusticeIsComing',\n",

A direct result of all that white flight (which took decades) is that the Democratic Party, as an establishment, is disproportionately black- and woman-powered. Never more so than now. /2\\nAnd that influence is probably at its greatest and most visible in the primaries, when the base gets to vote amongst themselves.\\n\\nMeaning, in the primaries, reliable Democratic *voters* are a huge part of the Democratic “establishment”. /3\\nThis is probably a good time to point out that there’s no one The Establishment.

Why: because there was already an investigative file open at least before May 12 - which is when Comey gave his memos to the FBI, as covered here: https://t.co/RgZ3jAHe1o\\nDreeben confirms that Trump was a \"subject\" of the obstruction of justice investigation. That\\'s not new either, but it is curious. If you opened an obstruction case pretty solely based on Comey being fired *by Trump* who *else* could ever be the \"target\" of such an investigation? https://t.co/keIuHpQ4y9\\nMueller\\'s report pretty much admits that the entire obstruction investigation was actually into the president\\'s conduct, so it\\'s clear the word games here are to pretend Trump isn\\'t the target and they just want to get his side of the story. https://t.co/1mWJqMHuyI\\nExcept, according to Trump lawyer John Dowd (speaking to @ByronYork) - Mueller told him personally on March 5 2018 that the president was a \"witness-slash-subject\" with \"no exposure\" 🚨🤔 https://t.co/14Z1xJqe7h https://t.co/ZQr5UZvpsG\\nBut, just a few weeks before agreeing with Dowd that Trump had \"no exposure\", Dreeben made this secret proffer - on behalf of Mueller - just a few weeks earlier on Jan 22 2018...\\n...where a few things are now clear:\\na) Trump is *at minimum* a subject, not a mere witness\\nb) Trump\\'s really the *target*\\nc) Trump\\'s the only logical target of an investigation started into his conduct\\n\\nDid Mueller mislead Dowd? 🤔\\nRemember: Comey was the FBI Director &amp; he knew Trump had asked if he could possibly \"see his way clear\" to \"let go\" Flynn. Comey DID NOT open an obstruction investigation. So the only reason to open one after Comey is fired is: because Comey got fired. And his buddy McCabe did it\\nOh and if it turns out that McCabe opened that obstruction investigation on May 10 2017, then the later excuse that the FBI did it because of what Trump said to Lester Holt is a lie, because that interview wasn\\'t until May 11. Can someone ask Mueller this if he ever testifies? 🤔\\nIt\\'s also now obvious in retrospect that Rosenstein\\'s appointment order letter to Mueller made specific reference to regulation 20 CFR 600.4 to cover obstruction of justice since it would have been easier just to say all the regulations applied to the Special Counsel https://t.co/dofyEGxGCb\\nOh &amp; the reason the obstruction investigation starting almost immediately after Comey was fired isn\\'t *new* is because it was leaked to Collusion Media reporters at the Washington Post on June 14 2017. Obviously by either McCabe - or more likely, Mueller\\'s team (who don\\'t leak!) https://t.co/mH3D8IhxaS\\nFinally, the proffer reveals Dreeben\\'s precise role on the Special Counsel (\"Counselor\" to Mueller) and that he was involved at all stages of the investigation.\\n\\n/ENDS https://t.co/5nf5MH9sgV',\n",

The Internet opened thousands of doors that could never be closed again. No one would ever be foolish enough to try another scam like Dan Rather\\'s.\\nBut China showed it COULD be done.

You just have to make dissidents shout through cupped hands while giant megaphones are handed to those who toe the ideological line.\\nRemember what happened in Rathergate, when a few intrepid bloggers with relatively limited followings broke a story that blew up into major media coverage? All the Left had to do was figure out how to arrest the \"blowing up\" process.\\nIf you broke a Rathergate story today, you would quickly find yourself removed from YouTube, banned from Facebook, demonetized, yanked off popular social platforms.

Entire news cycles would pass. Polls could shift and elections could be held before the viral story broke into heavily policed information space.\\nBig Media understands all this. They demand rush treatment and snowballing news coverage for the stories that fit their politics. Reporters spend a lot of time on social media boosting Narrative-friendly stories or even inventing them by stitching a few tweets together.\\nIf the media politically approves of your story, it swings from one news hook to another like Spider-Man, never out of the top search results and top news aggregation sites. If it doesn\\'t approve, your story trundles along through the back alleys of information space.\\nSo the new censors can\\'t really shut you up entirely, but they CAN slow you down. They can quarantine your information from achieving viral penetration by forcing it to spread more slowly, while the stuff they like spreads with insane speed and few \"content rules\" to worry about.\\nReal journalists, people truly committed to the spirit of free inquiry, would be fighting this tooth and nail. They would understand the SPEED of information is vital. Governments and corporate cabals should not be allowed to slow it down to protect their interests.\\nBut instead, Big Media is primarily interested in re-establishing the guild privileges it lost so decisively in the time of Rathergate, concluding a process that began with the dissolution of Big Three network power.

The nature of the ease might surprise, as the BOJ has to overcome the self-imposed constraint of its Yield Curve Control regime, that monstrosity that biases policy to be pro-cyclical. 1/\\nThe background to an ease is fairly simple: inflation is nowhere near Kuroda’s goal of above 2% for a period of time, growth going in the wrong direction, and a likely recession inducing consumption tax hike is set to be enacted in October. 2/\\nThen there is the added concern of a strengthening JPY amid a more uncertain global economy and a weakening Japanese economy. (The JPY is pro-cyclical, tending to be weak when a strong economy boosts risk appetite and overseas capital outflows). 3/\\nThe case for an ease is compelling, but what form will it take? This is where the constraints of the YCC comes into play.  The madness of this policy is that it makes monetary policy pro-cyclical when by definition it is meant to be counter cyclical. 4/\\nFor example, when Japanese growth expectations are strong JGB yields are biased to the top-end of the BOJ’s target band forcing more QE. But when growth expectations dim, JGB yields rally to the point that the BOJ may need to taper/end QE. 5/\\nWe are not far from that point now with 10yr JGBs at -15.5bp, close to the lower-end of the +/- 20bp band. Expanding the monetary base via more JGB purchases without broader changes to the monetary framework is not an option. 6/ https://t.co/A184YCviAM\\nNor is the growing talk of a 20bp cut to the BOJ’s -0.1% policy rate credible as a stand-alone policy decision. This would steepen the curve, increase the slide on long JGB positions and hence bias JGBs even closer to the lower end of the policy band. 7/\\nThis means that the BOJ’s ease might have to be comprehensive. The path of least resistance is to increase ETF purchases. Talk of capacity constraints seems overdone as the mkt is doing what you would expect: it to - expanding supply to meet demand. 8/\\nThe BOJ owns 64.5% of Japanese equity ETFs and the growth of the market means it is a while before it will encounter binding capacity constraints. However, a broader monetary easing will entail broader changes to the yield curve. 9/\\nThe +/- 20bp volatility band for 10yr JGBs might need to be re-centered or, more optimally, widened, to allow for greater downside potential in yield before QE is forced to end. However, to support the banks the BOJ will want to keep the curve steep. 10/\\nHence, the policy rate could also be cut by 20-30bp. This broad policy package is not being talked about – which may simply reflect that it is fanciful.  However, it may be a logical path for the BOJ were they to want to inject greater policy stimulus. 11/\\nOf course, the observation above does not focus on what is optimal. The optimal path is to not raise the consumption tax. The 2014 hike derailed Abenomics just as it was gaining momentum. The current hike will hit an economy already losing momentum. 12/\\nWith around half of JGBs also an asset of the government via the BOJ and with the neural rate close to zero, it’s hard to be concerned with public debt. Combine this with collapsed inflation expectations &amp; Japan is a prime candidate for helicopter money. 13/\\nHowever, if the path of orthodoxy is followed there remains the potential for a surprising bold round of policy easing by the BOJ, probably in September but quite possibly in July. 14/ https://t.co/gJ2ioacoj6\\nAs an aside, the inverted world of YCC that creates pro-cyclical monetary policy explains my shock to read the Fed recently praising Japan’s experiment.

But I accept that there is a debate to be had whether or not there would, in reality, be calamitous blockages at the border in a no-deal scenario. 2/\\nThere is an argument that (put crudely), under WTO rules the EU cannot erect unreasonable barriers and border checks to UK goods on SPS/TBT grounds (e.g safeguards on plant, animal and human health). 3/\\nTo do so, the argument goes, would be discriminatory when the EU knows our goods would still be compliant. How could there possibly have been time for any divergence in standards in the days immediately following Brexit that would justify such checks? 4/\\nThis is a fair point, as far as it goes. However, this “smooth border” WTO default scenario makes some assumptions that I think undermine completely Ridley\\'s argument... 5/\\nFirstly, it gives WTO rules a force and supremacy that simply doesn’t exist in practice. The EU (and by extension the UK) have behaved on a number of fronts in breach of WTO rules for many years (e.g. chlorinated chicken). 6/\\nThere is no magic WTO policeman who comes knocking, even if a breach of rules was clear (which it isn’t in this case – see @GeorgePeretzQC for more https://t.co/8NNaCjEvJb).

This (and VAT) will cause delays at the border on exports, not to say adding big costs to sectors such as lamb which rely heavily on EU markets. 9/\\nWhat of avoiding delays on imports by unilaterally eliminating checks? Well, this would mean (a) reducing/eliminating tariffs across the board to all importers (not just EU) with obvious implications for British farming. 10/\\n(On which point, was the post-Brexit vision set out at the referendum one which involved the decimation of our British rural economies?!) 11/\\n…and (b) we would need to reduce or even just scrap safety checks on food coming into the UK.

Yes I counted them - this represents thousands of codes. https://t.co/JjdJ2YIwMd\\nAs you can see, ABC isn’t the most biased in aligning its narrative with the employer, but it is certainly not biased towards left. The right wing narrative which dominated media framed the union and firefighter members as unreasonable, thuggish, greedy and trying to grab power.\\nI found this employer/Liberal narrative was so close to the Herald Sun/Australian narrative that it was hard to tell where it was born - seamless in its similarity and consistent across both groups.\\nHowever, I also found this same narrative evident in ABC and Guardian reporting - not biased to the same extent, but it certainly dominated both these outlets and the union/Labor narrative was used far less often (given far less credibility).\\nThe reason I used an industrial dispute as a case study is that it provides a generalisable case study to understand framing of political and economic news more broadly. The relationship between workers and capital is the basis of left wing versus right wing politics.\\nYou can see similar bias that I found in ABC industrial dispute reporting across much ABC political coverage. It is likely unconscious as Ita so helpfully points out. But it’s there - and it does change the way Australia understands politics.\\nA great example is way ABC reporters mostly write/talk about tax through a negative frame. Framing expert George Lakoff describes the success neoliberal/conservative politicians have had in using the phrase ‘tax relief’ to frame tax as something you are afflicted by - a negative.\\nHere is an article from ABC doing exactly this - framing tax cuts as a ‘relief’ - this is a right wing idea. Yes, this has become a dominant frame, but that nevertheless has a right wing bias. The capital class sees tax as a bad thing, and fight tooth and nail against paying it. https://t.co/NOVG6H1Epr\\nIf ABC really did have left wing bias as Ita suggests, tax would be framed as a positive thing. Tax is redistributive. Tax creates government services and spending to benefit the whole society. This is a left wing idea - that tax is positive. Framing it as negative is right wing.\\nSo successful have the neoliberals been at framing policies they don’t like as bad for the economy, and perpetuating a myth that left wing governments can’t manage money, these ideas have become rules of thumb, otherwise known as right wing biases.\\nThe biases towards the interests of the capital class are subtle, yet important. For instance, interviewing someone losing from franking credits changes, without also interviewing someone gaining from a policy funded by this change is not a balanced report.\\nI have found there is a structural bias across all media - sometimes subtle, sometimes overt - which benefits the views and interests of the capital class over the rest of society. The ABC exhibits such right wing bias. Not all the time. Not every report. But it’s there. End.',\n",

This, however, comes directly from an email, so I think it can be deemed fact. One of the most bizarre things in the entire election was the relentless build-up on Fox and other organizations about Hillary being infirm and sick. This started long BEFORE she....\\n@FoxNews 3...came down with pneumonia. She was accused - on  basis of nothing - of being infirm, weak, old, with Parkinsons, with epilepsy, etc etc. It always struck me as the ultimate proof that the conservative media bubble conspires in agreed-upon frauds, since her medical records...\\n@FoxNews 4...were public, and showed nothing. Hannity actually found some hack doctor to come on the air and diagnose Hillary with epilepsy on the basis that she had a goofy head movement once that was obviously her being humorous. Real neurologists - I know a lot of them - were....\\n@FoxNews 5...flabbergasted that someone claiming to be a doctor would say these things that were demonstrably false. But Hannity and all the rest of the conservative liars went with it. It was soon after it expanded to Parkinson\\'s and later Multiple Sclerosis. Again all on the basis...\\n@FoxNews 6...of nothing. When she had her issue with Pneumonia, and had a doctors record release to prove it, Tucker said on the air, \"Well, I don\\'t believe it. I think it\\'s something else.\" This was reckless but it always amazed me that they were all on message, all together, no limits..\\n@FoxNews 7...to how insane they would get in trying to proclaim Hillary on death\\'s door.\\n\\nUntil today. Now I get it. It was part of the Stone/Wikileaks conspiracy described in the indictment. Watch your emails, Hannity and Tucker. You might want to see if you are implicated....\\n@FoxNews 8...here is the relevant info. Stone was publicly claiming to be in contact with Assange by early August 2016. Lots of emails/text message were swapped around about this. (What idiots these guys are.)

(While I am not saying...\\n@FoxNews 10..I know anything as to who it is, I only know of two prominent Trump supporters in London who would be in contact with online political commentator in US - and both of them are jaw dropping if they are involved.) After that, Person 1 reports that Assange is going to do....\\n@FoxNews 11..two more document dumps.

What Trump hid, as I previously reported, is he had a second doctor from 1982-1990 named Dr. Joseph Greenberg...\\n3...Greenberg was widely known years later (particularly when 60 Minutes reported it in the 1990s) as a guy who prescribed uppers to famous people. The records show that Trump was one of his patients starting in 1982. The records show....\\n4...that Greenberg diagnosed Trump with a \"metabolic imbalance\" which somehow disappeared from his pre-election medical report. “Metabolic imbalance” is a catch-all phrase for different conditions and, in itself, is equivalent of a diagnosis of “heart problem.” There are....\\n5...electrolyte insufficiencies, anaerobic imbalances, acid imbalances, and an assortment of related disorders that can have serious health consequences. According to a 2007 peer-reviewed study, patients with underlying mental illnesses have a higher incidence of this syndrome...\\n6...the medical records reveal that Greenberg gave Trump a prescription for amphetamine derivatives in 1982 to treat his \"metabolic problem;\" the records show that Trump continued taking the drugs for a number of years and the former officials said that Trump stopped using...\\n7...on or about 1990. Now, before Trumpers start screaming \"fake news\" - Trump White House (Hope Hicks) admitted Trump used these when I asked, but lied to say it was only for a few weeks. I asked \"how do you know that, since the medical records show it is for many years?\"....\\n8...Hope never got back to me with an answer. So...let\\'s talk about what the records show. The derivatives were diethylpropion, known under its brand name as tenuate dospan. These drugs are designed for short-term use; studies have concluded that patients can...\\n9...only avoid developing a dependence on the drug if they take it for 25 weeks or less. But Trump continued downing the pills for years. According to two people – someone who said Trump would consider him a friend and a former Trump executive – the then-real estate developer...\\n10...boasted that the diethylpropion gave him enormous energy and helped him concentrate. A former Trump executive claimed to have picked up the medication while running errands for the boss. This person said the prescription, for 75 milligrams of diethylpropion a day, was....\\n11...filled at least for a time at a Duane Reade drugstore on 57th Street in Manhattan, a few blocks from Trump Tower. The executive said, like many celebrities, Trump used an alias for the prescription. Diethylpropion has a high risk of dependency and chronic abuse – such as...\\n12. ...taking it for years – can cause delusions, paranoia, and hyperactivity. Studies in medical journals also report it can result in sleeplessness and impulse control problems. Trump stopped the diethylpropion completely in 1990 under the supervision of a doctor, a former...\\n13...executive with his company said (ending the drug after long-term use causes serious withdrawal problems.) Until now, with the statements by the fellow who formerly worked with Trump, there had never been evidence that Trump began using such uppers again. Which is why....\\n14...@CaslerNoel statements about his watching Trump snort crushed up adder all is so important. Think of the probabilities here: Records show Trump used uppers from 1982-1990, then Casler says Trump was using them during his time working on the Apprentice. I don\\'t know Casler...\\n15...I don\\'t think he knows me. Isn\\'t it interesting that my reporting - and Casler\\'s statements about his personal experience - align so perfectly? \\n\\nDone.',\n",

       " 'hilo 235': 'THREAD: What does today\\'s news that Flynn is pleading guilty to making a false statement to the FBI mean?\\n1/ Today Special Counsel Robert Mueller will charge Flynn with making a false statement to the FBI. This is almost certainly a signal that Flynn has a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller. Read the charge here: https://t.co/fpFBqwhI6S\\n2/ We have heard reports that Flynn was under investigation for a wide variety of crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent.\\n3/ If Flynn didn\\'t cooperate, he could have been charged with other crimes, such as failure to register. For instance, Manafort was charged with a wide variety of crimes. Flynn\\'s indictment could have looked like that.\\n4/ This charging document is called an \"information,\" which is the same kind of charging document that Papadopoulos had. All that means is that the defense agreed that Mueller didn\\'t have to present the document to a grand jury for approval.\\n5/ The main benefit that Flynn appears to be receiving in this plea deal is that he is pleading guilty to one count of making a false statement to the FBI instead of pleading guilty to other crimes. The false statement charge carries a five-year maximum sentence.\\n6/ That means that no matter how bad the judge thinks Flynn is, or what sentence the judge would like to impose, he is \"capped\" at a five-year maximum sentence. That could be a very significant benefit to Flynn.\\n7/ This doesn\\'t mean that the judge won\\'t consider other things that Flynn did. In fact, the judge is required to consider all of the \"history and characteristics\" of Flynn, which includes other wrongdoing by him.\\n8/ But this plea could significantly affect the recommended advisory sentence under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. While the guidelines will factor in criminal conduct beyond the false statements it will only consider crimes that are part of the same \"course of conduct.\"\\n9/ Flynn\\'s lobbying work, for example, may not be part of the same course of conduct as the false statements. So this could result in a lower recommended Guidelines sentence, which could influence the sentence imposed by the judge.\\n10/ Flynn could still be charged with other crimes, either by Mueller or by a state Attorney General like Eric Schneiderman. That is a hammer that Mueller has over Flynn, if he does not truthfully testify and fully cooperate.\\n11/ That said, if Flynn cooperates, I don\\'t expect that he will be charged with other crimes. That means that he\\'s received a substantial benefit from Mueller, and suggests that Flynn can provide \"substantial assistance\" to Mueller.\\n12/ \"Substantial assistance\" means that Flynn can help Mueller make a case against someone else that Mueller thinks is worth charging. Generally defendants don\\'t get as much credit for \"cooperating down\" or cooperating against equals.\\n13/ That doesn\\'t tell us who Flynn is cooperating against. It\\'s possible that Flynn is cooperating against associates as well as Manafort and Gates, and Mueller thinks that\\'s sufficient. But there\\'s a reasonable chance that it\\'s someone bigger than that.\\n14/ None of this tells us what will happen with Flynn\\'s son, Michael Flynn Jr. I suspect that not charging Flynn Jr. might be part of the deal, but that would also be a very substantial benefit and would suggest greater cooperation by Flynn.\\n15/ Flynn won\\'t be sentenced until *after* all of his cooperation is complete, so the judge can consider his cooperation and factor that into the sentence. So we won\\'t know for quite a while, maybe years (if Manafort goes to trial), what his sentence will be. /end',\n",

Here is her song 'Ma Tagyeb' or don't leave:https://t.co/BQ62Pywwyz\\nThis is Fatima Ahmed, from (I think) Benghazi, singing 'Izz Elrafagha' or the dearest of companions. Another song I grew up hearing my mum sing: https://t.co/eOkSUZzlW1\\nThis is Salmeen Zarrough, another famous woman singer from Eastern Libya (I think), singing 'A'hadtni tsoun al-mahaba' or your promised to safeguard our love: https://t.co/rqB0ShI5RU\\nThis is Saif Al-Nasr, I am not sure where in Libya he's from but he is relatively modern. This is one of his most poignant songs 'Ayni Bakat' or my eye cried: https://t.co/BZW72uhkjS\\nThis is Adel Abdul-Majid, from Benghazi. He was my grandma's neighbour!

Five of Trump’s highest-level associates pleaded guilty to serious felonies, including his campaign chairman, personal lawyer, and national security advisor.\\nThe Trump campaign was willing and eager to work with a foreign adversary to interfere in our elections. This is far more significant wrongdoing even than the Watergate break-in and its subsequent cover-up which led to Nixon’s impeachment and resignation.\\nThe report also details 10 instances of obstruction of justice by the president, while in office. Over 1,000 former federal prosecutors from both political parties said this evidence is enough to support prosecution and conviction on felony obstruction of justice charges. https://t.co/lWYmYwgllE\\nMueller himself said he did NOT exonerate the president. He felt he could not prosecute Trump because of a DOJ rule against indicting a sitting president. He made it clear it\\'s up to Congress to take further action. Given the record presented, we are duty-bound to proceed.\\nThe Constitution provides that the president “shall be removed from Office, on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Nobody disputes that felony obstruction of justice is a “high crime” under the Constitution.\\nImpeachment is not a redo of the election.

But while this behavior is abhorrent, it is for voters to judge.\\nWe’ve seen terrible policies from Trump: dangerous foreign policy, tariffs that hurt Americans, reckless tax cuts, cruelty toward asylum-seekers, and attempts to rip health care from millions. I disagree with Trump\\'s policies, but they\\'re for elections, not impeachment.\\nImpeachment is not about the president’s character or policies. It’s about upholding the rule of law and defending the Constitution. It’s about whether he has broken the law. The Mueller Report contains plenty of evidence that he did. Hearings may produce more such evidence.\\nSome argue impeachment poses a political risk for Democrats. They say Republicans will claim Trump was vindicated regardless of the outcome. That gives Americans too little credit. I trust them to discern which of us did our patriotic duty and who played to political cynicism.\\nWe should never pursue impeachment for political reasons. Nor should we avoid it for political reasons. It’s Congress’ job to determine whether the president broke the law and acted against the interests of the United States.\\nIf we don’t act, we send the message that criminal behavior is normal for presidents. Trump will be more emboldened to ignore Congress. And we will increase cynicism among those who depend on us to uphold the law and the Constitution. None of that is acceptable.\\n@justinamash is right: “The risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ [impeachment] as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct...\" https://t.co/PkhS2aiBTM\\n@justinamash \"Our system of checks and balances relies on each branch jealously guarding its powers and upholding its duties under our Constitution. When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution, the Rule of Law–the foundation of liberty–crumbles.”\\n@justinamash Democrats are leading on the problems facing Americans: health care, ethics in government, comprehensive immigration reform and border security, gun safety, and civil rights. We must continue to pass groundbreaking legislation, as we have, and as we were elected to do.\\n@justinamash And now we are assigned another solemn task by the Constitution and by current events. We need to begin impeachment hearings.',\n",
       " 'hilo 238': '\"Global warming\" can make winter colder.\\n\\nJet streams are a fascinating piece of the climate science puzzle that most people have never considered. Learning about this one simple thing for 5 min explains SO MUCH.\\n\\nWhen everyone knows this we will all accomplish more.\\n\\nTHREAD https://t.co/vwl04KJ5sX\\n1. First point:\\n\\n\"Weather\" (clouds, storms, rain ect.) is pushed around by wind.\\n\\nThere are some major, reliable, high altitude winds like the jet steams that push weather around the Earth in predictable patterns. https://t.co/AIKBs4mVXy\\n2. Here\\'s how jet streams work:\\nThe sun warms the air around the equator all year. The warm air then moves up and towards the poles. The air coming off the poles towards the equator is freezing cold. Where the warm air and cold air collide the jet stream is formed. https://t.co/F4AAYR5RJN\\n3. The jet stream is like a fast moving (about 275 mph) river of air that goes from West to East (due to the Earth\\'s spin.) When a strong steady flow of hot air hits a strong flow of cold air the jet stream is formed in a fairly straight line. https://t.co/HT2M5wm112\\n4. The temperature doesnt stay the same all of the time. The Earth\\'s position changes during the year causing the sun to warm it differently. It also spins so is cooler at night etc. So a normal jet stream tends to look like this and shifts predictably with seasons. https://t.co/pzlWxzFOFZ\\n5. These high atmosphere winds bring us much of our weather, &amp; because they are so reliable in the way they move &amp; change from winter to summer they bring us mostly predictable seasonal weather. So predictable, in fact, that our ecosystems have developed in response to them. https://t.co/A7IjbgqF9P\\n6. Global warming is causing warming at the poles. (Among other things.) When the air at the poles is warmer then the interaction between warm and cold air isnt as forceful  which causes the jet stream to slow and meander like a slow river on an open plain looking more like this. https://t.co/K1vYFNm51X\\n7. This brings much colder air further south causing winter cold and storms in the US that previously were kept in Canada, while the Arctic has warmer than average temperatures. It also causes changes in rain and snow patterns. https://t.co/VkKGAqbkGZ\\n8. The current cold spell includes a related phenomenon. Scientists believe a meandering current of air cut through the polar vortex this year causing it to split in two with one segment getting pushed south to hover and swirl over the US, waiting for spring to dissipate it. https://t.co/zawicWYQ4R\\n9. Another rarely mentioned result  of predictable air currents is that when the strong current of air like a jet stream encounters a storm at high altitudes it dissipates the swirling force, keeping storms small.\\n\\nWeaker jet streams = bigger storms.\\nhttps://t.co/8P4jm6vg9s\\n10. Climate science is complex with lots of moving parts, many of them happening out of sight high above the Earth.\\nEverything we can say about it is over simplified and sometimes not yet known. \\n\\nThis makes it easy to ignore or deny. https://t.co/6s1gEvBauU\\n11. Beyond that anyone profiting off (or using) coal, oil, plastic etc. has a vested interest in ignoring (or even suppressing) the understanding of climate change. We all love our cars plastics, heat, convenience... https://t.co/CfKWQPgnCU\\n12.The warmer the Arctic gets the more the jet stream will shift and meander.\\nOur winters will get colder, summers drier, storms bigger. Weather patterns will change killing eco systems.\\nThis is why sharing info on climate change is absolutely vital today.\\n/end https://t.co/UuLbUAyI9Y\\nSome additional links to read more:\\nhttps://t.co/m9X2wetyFW\\nOne way the jet stream can move the polar vortex\\nhttps://t.co/CdDhTGdMz1\\nMore on the vortex\\n\"...can cause kinks in the jet stream so that, instead of flowing west to east, there are a lot of dips and ridges. And the waves in the jet stream can disrupt the lower (tropospheric) polar vortex, break off a lobe and force it south.\"\\nhttps://t.co/i7pSGX7fyj',\n",

The facts of the case and timeline are most fascinating.\\n2. Strzok\\'s dismissal was revealed less than a day after Gen. Flynn pleaded guilty. Remember that. Less than 24 hours later. However the dismissal occurred over the summer. I\\'ll repeat: he was dismissed over the summer, we hear about it a day after Flynn pleads guilty.\\n3. Strzok was texting pro-Hillary text messages with Lawyer Lisa Page who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Page and Strrzok were having an extramarital affair. The two pro Hillary lovebirds exchanged texts during both Hillary server and Russia- Trump investigation\\n4.

Strzok was key figure when FBI, in 2016, received Trump \"dossier\" and launched a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the election that ultimately came to encompass FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.\\n7. Strzok briefed house intelligence committee on Dec. 5, 2016, within months of that session HIC investigators were contacted by an informant suggesting that there was “documentary evidence” that Strzok was purportedly obstructing the House probe into the dossier.\\n8. HIC Chairman Devin Nunes asked Rod Rosenstein in Oct 2017 who oversees the Trump-Russia probe since Jeff Sessions\\' recusal, to make Strzok available to committee for questioning. This was denied: on broad \"personnel\" grounds.\\n9. While Strzok’s removal from the Mueller team was a matter of public record by August, at no point did we know about his Pro-Hillary texts and overall stance. This was revealed by \"sources\" only a day after Gen Flynn\\'s plea.\\n10. Think about the fact that Jeff Sessions\\' recusal put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein next in line to be asked directly for facts pertaining to Strzok and his involvement in Hillary\\'s server as well as the Trump dossier. Coincidence?\\n11. How about the timing of Strzok\\'s extramarital texts to Lisa page? Who leaked that information? Why was information leaked strategically right after Gen. Flynn\\'s guilty plea. I doubt there are any coincidences in what is going on right now.\\n12. Strzok is the key that opens a Pandora\\'s box of treasonous activity designed to get Hillary elected, bury her illegal activities and subjugate the will of the American people.\\n13. Remember Trump\\'s \"You\\'re going to be in jail\" comment to Hillary during the debate, followed by his own asking of her to be \"left alone. Then Jeff Sessions recused himself. All made little sense when it happened.\\n14. Trump does very little without knowing way in advance what it\\'s going to result in. He then confuses the hell out of the media by his obtuse tweets that are designed to discombobulate and stun idiots of all manners.

       " 'hilo 245': 'To mark the 15th anniversary of the US war in Iraq, here’s a thread on some of the war’s darkest moments. https://t.co/p0rAVD5G4N\\nThe war, which is one of the greatest crime of last half of 20th century, killed over 1 million people, displaced millions more, brought unknowable depths of suffering to the Iraqi people &amp; gave birth to ISIS. https://t.co/YDZMIOVgOi\\nThe US fueled the civil war in Iraq by funding sectarian death squads. The US brought in Jim Steele, who had advised US-backed death squads in El Salvador in the 1980s.  At the height of the Iraqi civil war 3,000 Iraqis were dying a month. https://t.co/37UZK24pMT\\nThe US troops in Iraq fired tens of thousands of rounds of radioactive depleted uranium, often in close proximity to civilian areas. https://t.co/MzHihI7Duv\\nThis and other heavy metals used in US bombs have caused widespread birth defects in Iraq. https://t.co/4R43TFplf0\\nThe US siege of Fallujah involved cutting off water &amp; blocking food/medical supplies into the city for 3 weeks. Many women/children took their chances &amp; fled, despite the danger. However men were prevented from leaving &amp; were ordered back into the kill zone.\\nDue to the enormous US firepower used on Fallujah, the city has been left w/ a toxic legacy. One study shows incidents of infant mortality, cancer and leukemia exceed those reported by survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. https://t.co/DJKe00D5He\\nThe US engaged in routine torture of Iraqi prisoners, most infamously at Abu Ghraib, where Saddam’s security forces had notoriously tortured prisoners. The US troops at Abu Ghraib engaged in physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, torture, rape, sodomy, and murder. https://t.co/u5ZS9vLujr\\nThe most egregious allegation at Abu Ghraib are that US soldiers raped Iraqi women, beat people to death &amp; that there was a videotape, apparently shot by US personnel, showing Iraqi guards raping young boys. \\nhttps://t.co/YdbQrH173I\\nThe US tried, in every possible way, to prevent elections in Iraq. The US was finally forced to allow elections by mass outpourings of people demanding elections. When the US/UK finally allowed elections, they did their best to subvert them. https://t.co/uwLKGG2UKu\\nUS relied on vicious mercenaries like Blackwater, which routinely engaged in murder and earned millions to help the US brutal occupation. The most infamous of their crimes was the Nisour Square Massacre, which killed 17 Iraqi civilians &amp; wounded dozens more. https://t.co/XCYCvJRHn1\\nThe war in Iraq was launched as part of the US war on Terror, however the war drastically increased incidents of terror. Jihadis from around the world came to fight the Americans. The first ever suicide bombing in Iraq took place in 2003, after the US invasion. https://t.co/PYy3ex7vo2\\nUS forces regularly targeted civilians in Iraq. This was demonstrated by the “Collateral Murder” video leaked by Chelsea Manning, in which a US Apache fires on unarmed Iraqis &amp; then again on the 1st responders. 12 ppl were killed &amp; 2 children were wounded. https://t.co/viYL34q8RG\\nThe brutal US-run prisons in Iraq became Jihadi Universities where future terrorists became radicalized &amp; built a network. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was held for 10 months in a US-run prison in Iraq. \\nhttps://t.co/KWfhpP6ohr\\nAfter the war, Iraq suffered major destruction of its rich cultural heritage, which included looting and burning of the Iraq National Museum &amp; a large number of mosque bombings.  https://t.co/ETDedNq7JB\\nUS military bases produce an enormous amount of toxic trash &amp; US military burned it all in huge open air pits. The result has been 1000s of US troops &amp; Iraqi’s living near US bases have become seriously sick or developed cancer. \\nhttps://t.co/yumYFNMMxa\\nWar criminals like George W. Bush (and the rest of the architects of the war) should be in prison instead of running around free while Iraqis continue to suffer the consequences of the war. https://t.co/grDCFZLMR4',\n",
       " 'hilo 246': 'In today’s “how are people this dumb” thread I’d like to address the vague legal threats that have been popping up in my mentions regarding “being on a list” and “GDPR”. #repealshield @repeal_shield ➡️\\nYes love, you are on a list. It’s called a block list. It’s one of twitters core functionalities. Wow, look here I can even see and manage my own block list from within the app! 🤓 Now, you’re hardly complaining about someone using a choice to block ya are ya? ➡️ https://t.co/ouZBzzwdKb\\n“I don’t care who you block you can’t share your block list like that” Au contraire my ignorant friend, that is also a functionality of Twitter- the ability to export and import block lists. https://t.co/opDkdSDYgz ➡️ https://t.co/73u3mX3d4Z\\n“But but you’re not using Twitter functionality you’re using an app”. Actually blocking is also available in the twitter API. The @blocktogether app is even a bit cleverer- it checks your followings first and never blocks someone you follow. https://t.co/WbHBonxfwe ➡️ https://t.co/bG87oIuLw9\\nSo we’ve established that blocking, blocking programmatically and sharing block lists are all part of Twitters functionality. ➡️ https://t.co/ZDELifxSnW\\n“But... but... I can’t opt out/ I didn’t give permissions”. Firstly, no one needs permission to block you (lol unless you’re a certain president). Secondly, block lists aren’t even the only twitter lists you can’t opt out of. Let’s see what lists I’m in: ➡️ https://t.co/E1jsW1HxZp\\nHmm what other arguments have this bunch of bananas been shouting? Oh “you’re storing my private information”. Nope, @Twitter is storing your data, and you gave twitter permission to. Let’s look at the privacy policy: https://t.co/I3hszlAQUA https://t.co/GHNHOdSRwI\\n“But... but... GDPR!” Firstly, I’ve yet to be convinced any of the crusty crabs complaining about GDPR know what it even is. As a non commercial entity, GDPR doesn’t apply. Even if it did, which it doesn’t, see entire thread so far, everything is within the rules. ➡️\\n“This is a list of political opinions and that’s not allowed”. Again nope. The block list is a list consisting of people that in my opinion spread misinformation, are time wasters, send graphic pictures, or send abuse. I’m entitled to that view, or would you censor me? ➡️\\nI mean, the fact that many of em share one or two of the same views is largely irrelevant - it’s not a list of antichoicers, it’s a list of silly sausages that in my opinion are better ignored. ➡️ https://t.co/xQEkwBK7Lh\\nAlso, I’ve seen screenshots of “threats” from someone that’s been blocked who also has me blocked- you are literally complaining about something that you’ve also done- exercised your freedom to block someone. *facepalm* ➡️ https://t.co/ERsbUjZD8d\\n“But you’re creating an echo chamber” So what? If people want to filter their social media accounts to exclude people that are acting the eejit, fair play to em. My twitter is a much better place now, and I’ve had 100s of msgs of support from subscribers saying similar. ➡️\\n“But the referendum is over”. Weirdly the abuse seems to have ramped up since, a contagious case of loseritis I think. Regardless, the block list is now set to private- no new subscribers can be added. A few blocks are being made here on there on request. ➡️\\nWe are figuring out next steps, and while I will be stepping away from the project now that we’ve achieved our objective, I will still be around for tech support on unsubscribing etc. ➡️\\nI think that covers all the complaints and threats that the hive mind have been throwing at me. 🙄 At the end of the day it boils down to “be better and maybe then people won’t want to block you”. ➡️\\nAlso, I personally take the consistent negative chatter about repeal shield to be a massive compliment on how well the tool has functioned. It kneecapped the abuse and misinformation strategy many wanted to employ. I revel in your anger, that’s just my opinion. 😉 https://t.co/uxK0I8B3Lu',\n",

One of their outrageous suggestions: Men who fail to anally self-penetrate with sex toys are exhibiting transphobia. Yup. \\n\\nAccepted and published in the journal Sexuality and Culture.\\nhttps://t.co/IVZilltBZR\\nThe more prevalent this kind of thinking is on college campuses, the more power the ideology has in hiring decisions on campus, on training of teachers for the K12 system, and on the larger world. What happens on campus does not stay on campus.\\nRemember the google memo? @JamesADamore wrote a long memo considering why there might not be a 1:1 sex ratio among software engineers at google.

Fragile employees needed time off, and he was fired.\\nhttps://t.co/jfxHzDXYtE\\nIn this event, which I did with James Damore, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose, activists stormed out when I made the outlandish claim that men and women are, on average, physically different (19 min-ish):\\nhttps://t.co/pSE2iH7Zqr\\nHowever: the timing of the activists’ storming out was coincidental, as it turns out. Here is my framing of why I find this type of “activism” so dangerous. It is “read-only.” It does not respond to new information.\\nhttps://t.co/gyfiJn0VlQ\\nThis ideology has oozed off campus, into high schools &amp; grade schools, into cubicles &amp; theater troupes &amp; retail establishments. I’ve seen signs advising me not to address cashiers by gender. It’s a madness that celebrates fragility, and denies reality.\\nhttps://t.co/jb3KUkyCwf\\nA U.S. congresswoman has petitioned for trans-women’s rights to compete against women in powerlifting. If natal males are allowed to compete against natal females, the natal males will win. In contact sports, they will also hurt women in the process.\\nhttps://t.co/CLoGWT4VuP\\nTestosterone organizes the body and brain from before birth. It also activates “secondary sex characteristics,” like hair and muscle growth and the lowering of one’s voice. But those organizational effects, including things like skeletal form and brain architecture, persist.\\nTestosterone doesn’t make a boy male—but it contributes to “masculinizing” him. Similarly, a Y chromosome doesn’t make a boy male—but it, and the SRY gene on it, initiates a cascade of “masculinizing” events. Pretending otherwise is dangerous, and regressive. /end',\n",

Here’s why partial blackouts are unfortunately likely to persist for a while. I sincerely hope I’m wrong.\\nThis is Venezuela’s main power distribution hub, the San Geronimo B substation outside Valle de la Pascua on Sunday. It was shut since Thursday. A cow roamed among transformers. No buzz from current. Workers said most of them were sent home indefinitely Friday. https://t.co/qX14VqJzqA\\nSan Geronimo B is the only path for high-voltage (765 KV) supplies from Guri to 80% of Venezuelan population (Caracas, Central &amp; Western Venezuela). https://t.co/DGACmEQ5tg\\nThe nearby San Geronimo A back up substation transmits much weaker 400 current  from Macagua hydro plant near Guri to Caracas vía Santa Teresa. It’s been working on &amp; off last 2 days. This, together with some limited thermal, is what’s been keeping intermittent light in Caracas.\\nCorpoelec current, former employees &amp; power expert @SoyJoseAguilar said this is unsustainable. The 400 KV line is too weak. Caracas outgrew is capacity already in early 80s when it launched Metro.\\nIs it possible to provide stable supply to the country without San Geronimo B? “Impossible,” said @SoyJoseAguilar\\nThe La Horqueta substation in Villa de Cura, which sends Guri’s power to Valencia and onwards west via San Geronimo was also down Sunday. This is very bad news for Western Venezuela. They are last in line. https://t.co/M22OFYaClc\\nSan Geronimo B is not working because it’s not getting sufficient (if any) current from Guri. That’s the scariest part. It provides evidence that the government is far from successfully restarting its turbines.\\nWhat caused the Guri failure? Corpoelec union leader Ali Briceño said it was brush fire under the 765 KV trunkline which caused a surge in the system and caused Guri to shut down. There are no skilled operators left there to restart it.\\nIt did happen before. No one is cutting grass or maintaining fire breaks under the trunkline. https://t.co/d4mvgqp7VB\\nBriceno’s theory is “possible but not probably,” said one of the people who built that trunkline. Fire would’ve had to occur in a relatively small stretch, between Guri &amp; the first 765 KV substation, Malena, for that to happen.\\nThere are also three parallel 765 KV lines running at a distance from each other. Unlikely the fire would’ve affected them all.\\nMost people I talked to say the problem had to occur inside Guri’s turbines themselves. And that’s a scary thought. If they are damaged, they will be very hard to replace or repair. No money or skilled people.\\nOne Corpoelec manager said after the blackout a Guri operator told him “the turbines are failing,” before hanging up. He hasn’t been able to reach anyone there since. Sebin is a constant menace.\\nAnd without Guri, it’s Mad Max.\\nThe government’s failure to present a coherent explanation is only raising my fears that something really bad has happened. First it was industrial sabotage, then it was cyber attack.\\nGovernment has already cancelled classes Monday and @vladimirpadrino said “there’s still a lot to do” Sunday.

He\\'s keeping a *very* tight lid on them.\\nhttps://t.co/uUHpJSqx6D https://t.co/beyMcw1cQO\\nGrassley &amp; Burck made deal where, of the few Kavanaugh papers that the Senate does receive, tons are labeled \"committee confidential\"—meaning the 79 senators *not* on the Judiciary committee don\\'t get to see them.\\n\\nCollins &amp; Murkowski aren\\'t on committee.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/8oF1bHAXT1\\nThe \"committee confidential\" documents contain more evidence that Kavanaugh, under oath, said things that weren\\'t true when, after serving in W\\'s White House, he went through confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship.\\n\\nPerjury? Dunno. Profoundly concerning? For damn sure. https://t.co/9eWDTHsibV\\nAs Sens. Feinstein, Leahy, &amp; Durbin wrote to Grassley today, \"These are serious questions that could easily be addressed if we were given access to his records.\" \\n\\nBut the National Archives practice is only respond to Committee Chairs. Like... Grassley.\\nhttps://t.co/NZTycDwSa0 https://t.co/19Jyv1xpcB\\nNote: within even the subset of Kavanaugh records that Grassley has requested from the National Archives, many won\\'t be ready until late October—potentially *after* the confirmation vote. The docs discussed in this thread are coming through Burck\\'s separate process. https://t.co/oICSchwVvM\\nDems have filed Freedom of Information Act requests to try to get at the mountain of unreleased Kavanaugh documents. If that doesn\\'t work, they announced today, they\\'ll file suit. \\n\\nIf that doesn\\'t work, GOP lawyer Bill Burck gets to decide what comes out.\\nhttps://t.co/Vf63qTYwty\\nSo, to wrap up here: The GOP is going to elaborate lengths to hide Kavanaugh\\'s papers. The few that *have* come out raise serious problems. If you follow Democratic senators on Twitter, you\\'ll see the hashtags #WhatAreTheyHiding and #ReleaseTheRecords over and over. This is why.\\nAddendum: This video pretty much sums it up. #ReleaseTheRecords #WhatAreTheyHiding #ThisIsRidiculous\\n\\nhttps://t.co/8BatCAlXfy\\nSo, you want to help #stopKavanaugh?

Then head to https://t.co/rQe4nsZfWn &amp; find your nearest protest on Aug 26.\\nThere’s a rolling wave of #StopKavanaugh protests happening week to week. Get involved. But definitely, definitely mark your calendar for 8/26. That’s the big bag; more than 100 demonstrations simultaneously nationwide. None near you? Register your own. https://t.co/8uUgBh9Q5U.\\nWhat’s the path to victory? Clearest one hasn’t changed since since the moment Kavanaugh was nominated. Here’s my speech from that night, outside the Supreme Court. It boils down to Collins and Murkowski. Mainers and Alaskans, your country needs you. \\n \\nhttps://t.co/NMmU0BiX3f\\nIf you’re not a Mainer or an Alaskan, though, don’t think for a minute that your voice doesn’t matter. We need noise and energy *everywhere,* so Dems know to unite &amp; fight (several are dangerously on the fence!) and Republicans get nervous. That creates room for Collins &amp; Murk.\\nIn the fight against Kavanaugh, we shouldn’t kid ourselves that victory is at hand, or even likely. But we also shouldn’t give in to the cop-out of despair. Things can change fast in these fights. If something explosive comes to light, we want it to be the final exploding straw.\\nIn other words, pressure now sets the stage for new revelations or hearing fireworks to actually matter. If there’s no pressure beforehand, new stuff can’t tip the balance. It’s our job to push as far as possible given today’s conditions, so that tomorrow’s could prove decisive.\\nAnd as you work on all of this, don’t forget the stakes. https://t.co/xW4ipC5mzC\\nThere’s a little sparkle of irony in the fact that it was Harriet Miers—the most recent failed SCOTUS nominee—who emailed the torture talking points to Kavanaugh, two years before he said under oath that he knew nothing about the policy. \\n\\n(Thx to @Bayl3rat for catching this.) https://t.co/TPROCOvMLf',\n",

Many, I believe correctly, speculate that Q is military intelligence (possibly #GeneralFlynn) or at least uses this for some sourcing.\\n3/ Recently, a YouTube channel \"American Intelligence Media\" (AIM) claimed that Q is a LARP/#Psyop. This was upsetting to many as it has seemed that #AIM is dedicated to exposing the cabal and the #DeepState, w/a rightfully-heavy focus on the #SeniorExecutiveService (#SES).\\n4/ The recent push by #AIM about the #SES may have caused AIM to be targeted. How do we interpret the claims by AIM?\\n5/ Here is my analysis: There are many factors that serve to debunk the #AIM video that tries to debunk #QAnon as legit, namely:\\na. They claim that @jerome_corsi says he has communicated directly w/#Q. This is absolutely not true.\\n6/ b. They claim that #QAnon contacted them directly. Q said he would engage in \"No comms privately w/ anyone.\"[...]\\n7/ c. They claim that #Q could NOT be a close insider since the release of the info would be a national security violation that would put them in jail. This is NOT THE CASE if it is a true insider w/authorization from #POTUS, who can declassify ANYTHING.\\n8/ d. They falsely claim #Q has not shown confirmations w/in 3 weeks of predictions. This is easily disproven by the dozens of confirmations of Q…of connections to #POTUS (tweets, images from Air Force One, pen at Camp David, \"chain of command,\" hand gestures in speeches, etc.)\\n9/ …and of foreknowledge of events (BDT bomber, Hawaiian missile alert, NK deal, use of Omnibus deal to fund building the wall via Army Corps of Engineers). Look at 3/23 post https://t.co/WXPoHas6kU\\nvis-à-vis #POTUS\\' 3/25 tweet https://t.co/vHd4LYeYop\\n10/ e. They WILL NOT DISCLOSE how they figured out the original #Q to be legit…nor how they debunked the current one.\\nf. They also claim specific knowledge that #Sessions (\"we won\\'t reveal what we have on him\") is compromised but will not disclose it.\\n11/g. They claim that the current Q is anti-Semitic…based on WHAT evidence??\\nh. #AIM also specifically attacks other channels that are clearly on the side of patriots and truth. This is a classic \"divide and conquer\" strategy of the #Clowns.\\n12/ i. They claim to \"be smarter than the public\" (having solved the \"puzzle\" in minutes) and to have been invited into #Q\\'s Club.\\nThis behavior is 100% contrary to the Q movement (\"Where we go one, we go ALL\"), displaying the very \"elitism\" that we are fighting.\\n13/ In case it helps, they claim the #puzzle they solved is encrypted in this message:\\n\"Eagles rain fire on the Canaanite as the merchant of wine challenges Sirus. The sword of Lilly joins forces with Jacob\\'s adopted children.\"\\n14/ j. The idea that #Q was shut down by the cabal, who took control for a psyop, w/o making an effort to communicate this fact over many months is ludicrous. Also, it is hubris by #AIM to think that Q would target a relatively small YT channel w/60K subscribers.\\n15/ k. Important to remember: #Q warned us that \"they want you DIVIDED.\" The logical conclusion is either that #AIM is a #disnifo/#psyop channel or that it has been compromised.\\n16/ I believe that the latter interpretation is more likely based on their prior history, especially given the events that happened on the #8chan board a few hours ago. They were either threatened or have been trapped by their own arrogance into their current assessment.\\n17/ To conclude, all evidence...the many confirmations and the escalating attacks on #Q and efforts at division of #Patriots...point to #QAnon being a legit insider source providing real intel.\\n19/ The recent disinfo campaign and direct attack on #QAnon\\'s GA board today compel us to analyze. Please retweet/comment to engage a vigorous analysis/discussion. Our goal should be the #Truth and not to prove an embedded position.\\n/END',\n",
       " 'hilo 266': 'Hi @Liz_Cheney, I worked at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, where I gave tours to tens of thousands of folks, introducing them to things everyone should know about the Holocaust, things you\\'d know if you actually visited. @AOC is right... (thread) https://t.co/D6qirFASmf\\nFirst, 6 million Jewish people were slaughtered out of anti-Semitic hatred, but 17 million people total were systematically murdered. This included persons with disabilities, Roma, Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, LGBTQ folks, and other groups. Don\\'t erase that. \\n\\n(image: @HolocaustMuseum) https://t.co/xcXMJTMv8L\\nFor several years, there was a popular exhibit at @HolocaustMuseum called “Some Were Neighbors”. It meant to highlight how the Third Reich would not have come about without the complicity of civilians. Ordinary folks. Neighbors.\\nThe genius of the “Some Were Neighbors” exhibit is that it didn’t hold back. It talks about how doctors, lawyers, teachers, police officers—upstanding citizens—directly sold out their friends and neighbors (Jewish + others). Specific stories. Brutal stories. Violence + betrayal.\\nThroughout the exhibit were examples of real people who may have not worn Nazi armbands but turned-in Jewish folks, often unnecessarily. Some participated in violence. Most participated in discrimination. Just ordinary people, not Nazi party hacks, behaving ruthlessly.\\nThere was no subtlety about the exhibit. The message was clear: these people are just like you, just like your friends and family, and they viciously bought into Nazi ideals. Their ears and tongues did the bulk of the legwork in rounding up Jews and others to be exterminated.\\nAnd they were led to do this by vicious propaganda that downplayed the atrocities taking place. The German civilian population was held to a party line that Jews and others were simply being \"relocated\" to \"labor camps\". Questioning this would get you killed.\\nThe lack of transparency at the time about these camps is devastating, and instead of accountability on human rights, the vast majority of people did nothing and enabled shaming and violence toward those who wanted answers.\\nYou know what we did in America, @Liz_Cheney? Part of the main exhibit at @HolocaustMuseum is how we turned away Jewish refugees at our shore who were fleeing persecution in Germany and elsewhere. We turned them away, sending them to their deaths.\\nWe knew Jews were being persecuted. \\n\\n“What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other  land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. . . . We must speak  out.” —Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, March 1933\\n\\nThe headline below is an American newspaper in \\'33. https://t.co/2DOLIgpIo9\\nIn fact, as @HolocaustMuseum points out, American diplomats knew Jews and others were being targeted. We did nothing... until Americans were attacked in Germany in 1933. Hitler promised our diplomats that would end, and that was somehow good enough for us.\\nThis goes on for years. Stories of Jews and others being brutalized, rounded up, and put in \"work camps\", never to be heard from again. We knew about this because our leading newspapers reported it. Many of our citizens protested, but our government did nothing.\\nTwo full years before Pearl Harbor, American Nazis held a mass rally at Madison Square Garden in NYC. Over 20,000 packed the venue and yelled \"Heil Hitler!\" There were summer camps in the U.S. where American children wore Hitler Youth uniforms and marched with Nazi banners. https://t.co/3gW1HtyTaT\\nThere were able to do this, in part, because of people who diminished crimes against humanity, who constantly engaged in bad faith with reports of violence and discrimination against marginalized people. \\n\\n\"It can\\'t be that bad. You\\'re overreacting\", they said.\\n\\nIt was, and no.\\nThree months later, the MS St. Louis, carrying 937 Jews, attempts to land at Cuba. They were refused entry and came to the U.S., where our officials, by this point, were well aware of the atrocities. Just 937 souls. And we turned them away. A quarter of them were killed in camps. https://t.co/Ggkrc0YMFt\\nYou need to understand, Congresswoman @Liz_Cheney, that the Holocaust happened over a long period of time, abated by the persistent excuses of those in power to do something. Out of fear. Out of selfishness. Out of bigotry.\\nWhen Congresswoman @AOC refers to these places near the border as \"concentration camps\", where protocol is still secret and obfuscated, where abuses and unnecessary death have been documented, where children still live in seemingly intentional awful conditions, she\\'s right.\\nI would encourage you to visit the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Congresswoman @Liz_Cheney. You may find its content far more useful than as a vehicle to make a cheap political point while our government under Trump commits horrific atrocities against innocents. /thread',\n",
       " 'hilo 267': 'Manafort transcript unsealed tonight in which DC District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson rules that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort lied intentionally after entering a plea agreement:\\np.10: “My concern isn’t with non-answers or simply denials but times he affirmatively advanced a detailed alternative story that was inconsistent with the facts.”\\np. 11: Judge then says Manafort’s claims about his declining health in prison were simply asserted by his lawyers with no effort to back the claims up with any support. \\n\\nJudge: “It left the impression that the issue was left in the pleading for public consumption, but not mine.”\\np.16 On the $125k payment toward Manafort’s legal fees...\\n\\nJudge: “The record doesn’t seem to reflect confusion and the defendant didn’t profess to be confused. He does appear, though, to be making a concerted effort to avoid saying what really took place.”\\np.23 On that same $125k payment...\\n\\nJudge: “I find this was a matter about which he provided intentionally false information to the Office of Special Counsel, the FBI, and the grand jury. \\n\\nI also note — without deciding whether I have to make this finding or not —...\\n“... that the record supports a finding that the Office of Special Counsel’s interest in tracing the flow of funds to Manafort particularly from REDACTED and vendors associated with the campaign, was material to this investigation.”\\np. 26 On Manafort attesting as to Kilimnik’s state of mind...\\n\\nJudge: “I think it’s also fair to say that advancing that version was not just relaying what Kilimnik said, it appears to be an attempt to exonerate him.”\\np. 27 \\n\\n“This is an example of a situation in which the OSC legitimately concluded he’s lying to minimize things here... \\n\\nThis is a problematic attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability and it gives rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.”\\np.30\\n\\nOn what the judge describes as Manafort’s “pattern” of “dissembling” about Kilimnik:\\n\\nJudge: “Denying the meeting REDACTED was denying a contact that was part of what the Office of Special Counsel was investigating.”\\np.40\\n\\nJudge: “We’ve now spent considerable time talking about multiple clusters of false or misleading or incomplete or needed-to-be-prodded-by-counsel statements, all of which center around the defendant’s relationship or communications with Mr. Kilimnik”...\\n“... This is a topic at the undisputed core of the Special Counsel’s investigation into — as paragraph B of the appointment order put it — ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign.’ Mr. Kilimnik...\\n“...doesn’t have to be in the government or even be an active spy to be a link.”\\np. 41\\n\\nThis is new. This suggests the mysterious “other” DOJ investigation Manafort lied about is an investigation that also relates to the Trump campaign:\\n\\nJudge: “Defendant suggests that it’s not really that important because it wasn’t about his own wrongdoing...”\\n“... I’m not sure I buy that because the point of seeking cooperation from a person at the highest level of the campaign was to obtain accurate information about the acts of others, in particular what transpired REDACTED. So it’s very troubling to me.”\\np.44 On the (apparently campaign related) other DOJ investigation Manafort lied about...\\n\\nJudge: “The evidence suggests that he decided to obscure what had taken place to shield possibly Mr. REDACTED. This withholding of facts, this begrudging behavior...”\\n“...advancing a new version that’s less inculpatory of REDACTED was significant enough to set off alarm bells with his own lawyers.”\\nAnd then starting on p.50 a whole bunch of pages that look like this: https://t.co/aFQPMWsvhy\\nAnd then one last intrigue on p.66:\\n\\nJudge: “All right. I just have one question for my public minute order. The REDACTED, the fact that REDACTED is still sealed. So I should not use that in my minute order, is that correct?”\\n\\nBoth sides agree, correct. \\n\\nBut what could that be?',\n",
       " 'hilo 268': 'Today, I was sitting in front of a cafe in downtown D.C., minding my own goddamn business, when three people who were clearly tourists of some sort walked up and gestured for me to take out my headphones. And I did and one of them said: \"Can we pray for you?\"\\nI asked them why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk around the streets of D.C. and let God\\'s voice tell them who might be broken or otherwise need prayer. She literally used the word \"broken\".\\nNow... I\\'m a Christian, and I\\'m not opposed to prayer or people praying specifically for me when done in good faith. But I was dressed femme as hell today with gorgeous makeup and earrings, and I sure as hell caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.\\nAnd I thought: let\\'s do this. And I so asked their spokesperson if she understood how it might look to be searching for \"broken\" people to pray for and specifically pick out a random transgender person on the street to offer prayer. And they looked more than taken aback.\\nSo, I stood up, with what passed for a smile barely concealing my annoyance with this situation, and I asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. And their eyes go wide and the guy on the right starts nervously stammering in front of me in front of this cafe.\\nIt\\'s clear he\\'s having trouble answering the question, as are the other two, so ambushed are they that the \"broken\" transgender person is asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew, and I wait for a few seconds more than what is comfortable to answer.\\n\"You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus\\' name, there He is with us.\" And they stare blankly at me because they have tiptoed with their condescending, passive-aggressive bullshit straight into a brick wall, and I have no intention of going easy.\\n\"That is what Matthew says, is it not?\" And one of them says \"yes, that\\'s right\", and they don\\'t understand that the verse is commonly misused as a prayer for intercession rather than its true purpose as a prayer of accountability. And here, today, I shall bring accountability.\\nI have had it up to here with Evangelicals sticking their noses into how my humanity is defined, and I will be damned if they\\'re going to interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn\\'t bothering them.\\n\\n\"So, let\\'s pray.\" And they nervously step forward into a circle.\\nI say to one of them: \"You start us off.\" And she does. It is quick and antiseptic because they, the three of them, want to get the hell away from this awkward situation. And then I pick it up when it\\'s clear she\\'s done.\\n\"Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends...\" and I\\'m quite honest with God about how I hope She\\'ll bless my new friends w/ a priority for affirmation and inclusion of others. That their community will honor all as God made them and value the strength of diversity.\\nAnd I specifically mention the natural beauty of the LGBTQ community and thank God again for making us as we exist, and I throw-in there a genuine wish that their trip back home is a safe one and wrap the prayer up in the usual Evangelical banal phraseology to let them know...\\n...that I know their community\\'s vernacular better than they do, and by the time I am finished, by the time I have translated the score back to them by tenfold relative to their passive-aggressive \"let us pray for you\", they murmur their thank yous and scuttle thou hell away.\\nAnd now, hopefully, they will know how it feels to have someone inject an overwrought and venomous self-righteousness into the core of their being and--I hope--realize how much actions like these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBTQ people.\\nEvangelicals: you are not doing the Lord\\'s work by dumping your misplaced condescension on random strangers you believe to be, uh, \"broken\". \\n\\nThese people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I\\'m fairly sure Jesus would not do that.\\nSo, remember: if you ever feel the need to do this... don\\'t. Because it may backfire spectacularly, and you\\'ll wind up praying for a restored sense of peace after your varnish gets unceremoniously stripped away.\\n\\nPrayer should be a loving act, not a bizarre political weapon.\\nPOSTSCRIPT: Just wanna thank everyone who has reached out with kind and loving words as I can\\'t respond individually. Folks of all backgrounds get why this is important, and it gives me heart to see so much growing support for the transgender community and LGBTQ folks as a whole.\\nFYI: this is now available in essay format for those of you who understandably hate Twitter threads.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/YOwJwmMwWg',\n",

       " 'hilo 271': '1 So there are a bunch of issues with this @jackmintz piece in the @financialpost that should lead you to question it\\'s conclusions. It\\'s built around a 2003 study on “fragmentation” and its effects on GDP growth and governance quality  \\nhttps://t.co/cwBWdq1G82\\n1.5 I will accept for the purpose of this thread that the way to measure “strength” in the stupid battle over whether diversity is Canada\\'s is purely economically, in terms of contribution to GDP, because us immigrants are only desirable if we\\'re hard workers, or whatever\\n2 Let\\'s start with \"fragmentation.\" Mintz provides two definitions. One is in the context of the data he presents in this table. (Also, raw GDP over GDP per capita, which he uses elsewhere? Ew). It’s “measured according to shares of ethnic and linguistic groups in a country\" https://t.co/iS6j4FfEsG\\n3 Actually, the study itself defines it as “the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to different groups.” So basically the presence of more groups, or a large number of people from group two onwards, means fractionalization\\n4 Mintz\\'s in-text definition is “when citizens identify more strongly with a social group rather than the nation as a whole.” Guessing he meant this as a paraphrase. BUT it assumes that people who are from group two+ (you might call us \"immigrants\") ID more with group than nation https://t.co/mMs9UhNAzK\\n5 And in the case of Canada at least, that\\'s not true! The opposite in fact. Polling from Frank Graves and EKOS in this piece: Over the last 20 yrs, amidst a big increase in non-European immigrants, national identity is constant. Ethnic attachment is down\\nhttps://t.co/dI9vqbu5aJ\\n5.5 This reflects the raw total of people immigrating, not in relation to the population, of which first-year residents have been a higher share in previous years. Also reflects an increasing share of immigrants being non-European since some racist policies were lifted\\n6 To restate: Canadians have not been identifying \"more strongly with a social group rather than the nation as a whole\" even as \"the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to different groups\" increased. Defns of \"fragmentation\" contradict\\n7 This matters, Mintz says, because at the ballot box people act for the good of everyone if they associate more with the country as a whole than their own identity group. Implicitly that leads to worse economic policy and governance—I guess; he doesn\\'t quite complete the thought https://t.co/hpsk4TQcGD\\n8 Also, Mintz says, if our \"ethnic fragmentation\" was as low as the U.S., we\\'d add 0.4 points to GDP growth! This seems to be his extrapolation from the data and formulas, because I can\\'t find that specific calculation in the study https://t.co/U70KSWnk4z\\n8.5 The study is here, by the way: https://t.co/SiEtQVeZkO\\n9 Also, the data that he cites in the piece to show that Canada is \"ethnically fragmented\"—we\\'re a 0.7124—is from a 2003 study.  That\\'s 15 years ago! You know what\\'s happened in that time? Lots, including most of the active period of the trends Graves identified, cited above\\n10 Okay, Murad, get to the point already. Mintz\\'s prescription is that politicians should propose ideas for \"reinforcing our national identity\" to avoid \"all the risks that fragmentation can bring.\" As I\\'ve shown above, he hasn\\'t actually proved that these risks apply to Canada! https://t.co/kKzO3tEABa\\n11 Also, what \"national identity\" would that be?

       " 'hilo 272': '1. It’s been a funny old week. But perhaps the weirdest part has been the various very strange British media interviews with Irish politicians. [Thread]\\n2. The restrained irritation, anger even, has been quite something to see. It’s understandable that questions like, ‘Why don’t you compromise?’...\\n3. ...Or, the cosmically crass, ‘Why don’t you leave the EU?’ Are greeted with a profound sense of humour failure.\\n4. Of all the many reasons Irish politicians might be cross, one in particular seems to have escaped the attention of many commentators.\\n5. THE IRISH BACKSTOP IS NOT NEWS.\\n6. Let us count the ways.\\n7. The backstop was first hatched in the Joint Declaration of December 2017. Its implications were crystal clear to most sentient beings.\\n8. The backstop was reaffirmed by the PM in early 2018. By this point its implications should have been crystal clear to literally everyone.\\n9. Did anyone try to stop this terrible thing happening? Was there a no confidence vote in the PM given the terribleness of the backstop. There was not.\\n10. In fact, we had to wait for the Chequers debacle before there were any material Cabinet resignations.\\n11. Even more strangely, given the now apparent awfulness of the backstop, the government did not try to scrap it.\\n12. Instead, the government’s principal diplomatic achievement of the entire negotiations was to transform it into an all UK arrangement.\\n13. Even then, as Conservative opposition mounted, was there a no confidence vote in the PM because of the awfulness of the backstop? There was not.\\n14. We had to wait until December for the no confidence vote and even then was the matter of the backstop so terrible that TM lost the vote? 🤔\\n15. It was only after the Meaningful Vote debacle that the Irish backstop issue appeared as the apparently defining Deal or No Deal issue.\\n16. And even then, it was only because a 100 or so Conservative MPs decided, many of them belatedly to one degree or another, they didn’t like it.\\n17. To call the previous absence of effective (or meaningful) opposition to the backstop gross incompetence is  unfair to gross incompetents everywhere.\\n18. After almost two years of hard fought negotiations, an issue that has been obvious for at least a year and was agreed by the UK government is now going to cause No Deal? Please.\\n19. No wonder Irish politicians seem furious. And no wonder there is close to zero chance of materially amending the backstop that was agreed months and months ago. /ends',\n",
       " 'hilo 273': \"So, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has had a go at Sir John Major for being part of the European elite because of #Brexit. I think it is probably the time to tell a little story about JRM, how he acts and what people think of him.  Are you sitting comfortably...?\\nBack in the day, I started out as a research assistant at Scottish @Conservatives Central Office. As you’d imagine, I’ve a lot of stories I could tell but, sadly for you, you’ll never hear them. However, JRM has provoked this with his comments about Sir John.\\nBack in 1997, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was the Tory candidate for Central Fife. His passage into the seat was helped by the powers that be so that he could follow the time-honoured path of so many with the right connections of fighting some unwinnable seats before being given a safe one.\\nFor those of you who don’t know, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is the son of Lord Rees-Mogg, the former Times editor.\\n\\nCentral Fife was a no-hoper seat and it was an ideal place to show that JRM wasn’t scared of taking the Tory message to the most difficult of places.\\nI'm pleased to say that, these days, @ScotTories doesn't have the same mentality now and actually has candidates that understand the areas they want to represent. It's quite refreshing.\\nNow, if you are on the other side of the equation, you see a toff turn up with his nanny (yep, that did happen) to canvass and it reinforces everything you think about Tories. The powers that be seemed to miss that obvious consequence of placing @Jacob_Rees_Mogg in Central Fife.\\nStill, at SCUCO (Scottish Central Office) it was our job to brief the candidates. As a lowly research assistant, I didn’t brief many as it was thought that they would probably want to be briefed by the head honcho (@iainastewart - now MP for Milton Keynes).\\nOn the face of it, having a visit from a candidate who was the multi-millionaire son of Lord Rees-Mogg should have been quite a thing. We were used to VIP visits and we knew who got treated how and why. But somehow…\\nMysteriously, the day Jacob Rees-Mogg visited, everyone (including Iain) was busy. I mean really busy. Weirdly, everyone was there but everyone was so, so busy that nobody could brief him and the welcome was beyond short.\\nAnd so, Jacob Rees-Mogg was ushered in to my office.\\nHe sat opposite me, looked down his nose and listened as I started the briefing. It soon became clear that the briefing was of no interest to him at all. There was nothing I could tell him that he did not think he already knew (he didn't, of course, but he thought he did)\\nIn my time at SCUCO, I met and worked with people from the PM, cabinet ministers, MPs, councillors, Lords and Ladies and, I can say without fear of contradiction that the sneering sense of superiority during that half an hour was something I had never come across before or since.\\nHe was, he told me, in Scotland for a few hours to knock on some doors with Nanny and then he would be going back home. Such was his commitment – and also his contempt for the people of Central Fife.\\nHe left and I never heard from him again – indeed, I think @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was just about the only candidate in that election that never bothered asking a research question or policy clarification.\\nAs an aside, only one other person has ever refused a briefing from me and that, by some incredible coincidence, was @BorisJohnson – and it was made clear to me that if I wrote one, he would not read it. I suppose these #Brexit-ers aren't keen on facts.\\nBy contrast, I was sat in my office one day, typing, concentrating on the screen when I was suddenly aware of someone walking into my room. I looked up as he held out his hand and said “Hello, I’m John Major!” No pretence. No ‘do you not know who I am’. No ‘I’m better than you’.\\nIt was just a greeting that assumed nothing but was genuinely meant. We talked for a couple of minutes (I mentioned that we’d met before and we talked briefly about that before he remembered it) and then he was gone. His last words were “Thank you for everything you are doing.”\\nOf course, Sir John did not need to thank me. I was doing it because of him and what he stood for. I would have done it if he hadn't paid me. And, anyway, why thank me? It was my job. But he did. And that says something about him.\\nAt the end of the day, @jacob_rees_mogg will never amount to anything or achieve anything without the help of others. He is the very epitome of the British elite establishment that cares about nothing other than feathering their own nests - something #Brexit facilitates.\\n.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg can say what he wants about Sir John Major but, the bottom line is this: John Major is a member of no elite. He came from nothing, worked his way up &amp; he has more natural class, sense &amp; style than JRM or his ilk could ever hope for. And that will always be true.\",\n",

It has been over 21 days of non-stop diarrhea. It is a serious cause for concern when a one-year old baby has had diarrhea for so long.\"\\n\"I am afraid of what can happen to my son if he becomes dehydrated or if serious complications develop as a\\nresult of the diarrhea while we are in detention.\"\\n\"My son cannot eat the food served at Karnes. He neither receives a special, age-appropriate diet nor a diet specific for his health condition. All residents are served the same meals and no accommodations are made for serious medical and dietary needs\"\\n\"The medical staff told me that I need to “force feed” my son if he won’t eat.\"\\n\\n(Any doctors out there? Is this advice good advice? It sounds like terrible advice to us.)\\n\"I’ve been trying for weeks to get his medical records.\" Staff at the Karnes detention center have refused to share them.\\n\"The medical staff has on more than one occasion told me that I need to force feed my one-year old son if he doesn’t want to drink milk or eat. When I do this, he vomits and\\ngets sick—I’ve told them this repeatedly.\"\\n\"Diarrhea in children can become dangerous quickly and as his father, I feel helpless knowing that his condition could become more complicated at any moment. How much longer can a one-year-old baby not eat and suffer from painful, dehydrating diarrhea before something is\\ndone?\"\\n\"I have lost weight since being detained at Karnes. My pants are constantly sagging because of my weight loss. I cannot fathom the effects on my son’s body.\"\\n\"In addition to the diarrhea, my son has developed a cough and runny nose that won’t go away.\"\\n\"My son cannot sleep in detention at Karnes. He cries all night and is constantly woken up by all of the noise. He is having difficulty breathing and seems to have stomach pain, but I don’t know exactly the source of his pain because he can’t talk.\"\\n\"At night, the guards check on us every few hours and are we shaken by the sounds of the guards opening and closing doors at all hours of the night.\"\\n\"Prolonged detention with a one-year-old baby is an overwhelming, suffocating feeling. I do not feel like I can father my child here. I do not feel that I have control of his care.\"\\n\"Babies do not speak, but they see &amp; feel what happens. I know my son feels the pressure of our prolonged detention &amp; cries because of it. He\\nmay be little, but he does not want to be here. I feel depressed knowing the effect that our prolonged detention is having on my son.\"\\nThis father and his son are getting ready to spend night 22 at the Karnes detention center. \\n\\nWe\\'re desperately need your help to tag @ICEgov and demand they release this family. Please do it now, and again in the morning if they are not released. We\\'ll share any updates.\\n@ICEgov The baby boy and his dad are still detained.\\n\\nTonight will be night 23.\\n\\nPlease continue to call on @icegov to release them immediately.

       " 'hilo 275': 'I hope you\\'ll check out our @WXXINews story on how a local suburban district handled a Black History Month project that went wrong. I want to provide a little background. \\n\\n(Thread.)\\n\\nhttps://t.co/eYdUQMiYNE\\n2) Pittsford is one of the highly ranked districts in New York State. Like many suburban districts, it\\'s mostly white: 78% white students, and 99.4% white teachers, according to the latest numbers we have. \\n\\nThere are 481 teachers in the district. 478 are white. One is black.\\n3) If Pittsford\\'s teaching staff was proportional to its student body, the district would need to immediately hire another 14 black teachers. \\n\\n(By the way, this issue is not unique to Pittsford, at all.)\\n4) The question is, does a lack of representation impact teaching and learning? \\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at the botched Black History Month project. It happened at a Pittsford elementary school. The fifth grade assignment: honor 100 black inventors. Students created posters.\\n5) The students created the posters. The teachers hung them in the hallways for the month of February. \\n\\nOn March 1st, Dr. Jerome Jean-Gilles was there, picking up his two young children. They are an African American family.\\n6) Jerome noticed the posters seemed off. Wrong names, information. But then he saw a string of posters that included the name of a black inventor, but a photo of a white man. \\n\\nHe wondered: what on Earth is this about? White people getting credit for black inventions?\\n7) He took pictures of the posters; our story has three of them. We tried to figure out what happened. Let\\'s look at these three.\\n8) One poster is for Powell Johnson, inventor of protective eyewear. The photo is of President Andrew Johnson, a man who routinely described African Americans as inferior. A google search produces no help in determining how a racist president was depicted on this poster.\\n9) Then you have a poster for Alexander P. Ashbourne, refiner of coconut oil. The white man depicted is apparently Arthur James Balfour, former prime minister of England. No idea how that mistake was made.\\n10) Then you have William Purvis, an African American who patented an improved hand stamp during the 1800s. The white man on the poster is Edward William Purvis, a British army officer. A google image search lists the Briton third.\\n11) So how did these posters, designed to honor Black History, and which instead depicted white men, end up hanging in the school hallway? Superintendent Mike Pero says the project was ungraded. Students handed them in; teachers hung them up. No checking for accuracy.\\n12) But how could these obviously wrong posters hang in the hallway for several weeks without correction? The staff is almost all white; no one noticed. \\n\\nIt required a black parent to see the errors. \\n\\nParents tell me: this is what happens when you have an all-white staff. But:\\n13) Superintendent Mike Pero flatly denies that. I asked if the incident could have been avoided with more diversity on staff. \\n\\n\"No. I don’t think diversity in the teaching staff had anything to do with this incident,\" he said.\\n14) Dr. Jean-Gilles was reluctant to talk to me. He does not seek attention. He wanted a meeting, and a guarantee that the mistakes would be corrected. \\n\\nHe was told the project would not be redone; too much time had passed, and the district was concerned it could be politicized.\\n15) Pero: \"What we don’t want is for our staff to ever feel defensive or they’re on their heels or they’re going to be publicly shamed for doing something that has good intentions.\" \\n\\nHe added that the district owns this failure, and will make sure it is not repeated.\\n16) Jerome\\'s response: If this\\'d been a botched math lesson, of course it would be corrected. Why is a botched Black History project ignored?\\n\\n\"They didn’t even address this to the students. What’s the point of the school? If you’re not educating the students, what’s the point?”\\n17) Some parents have called for a Pittsford community forum. Superintendent Pero told me that this is not the right time for that kind of meeting, but the district is working with a new inclusivity committee. That work is meant to make all students and families feel welcome.\\n18) Dr. Jean-Gilles, meanwhile, is left wondering what to do next. He says he\\'s entirely unsatisfied. He believes more diversity on the teaching staff would have made a difference. \\n\\nWhile Pero disagrees, he says he cares about representation on staff.\\n19/end) You can decide for yourself if you think an almost entirely all-white staff contributed to this breakdown. Meanwhile, WXXI will compile updated numbers on local districts. In three years, has anything changed? Care to guess?',\n",
       " 'hilo 276': \"1 THREAD- Donald Trump’s Frontotemporal Dementia. Trump has a physical on 2/8. In a panicked move, he named Dr Ronny Jackson as his Medical Advisor 6 days beforehand. Ronny gave him the fantasy physical last yr &amp; is under investigation. This feels very much like Trump is cornered\\n2 A real physical for someone in Trump’s condition would immediately trigger a referral to a neurological team to further evaluate his symptoms &amp; deterioration. Most likely, White House Doctor Sean Conley isn’t giving Trump a pass on his condition or glowing review like Ronny did\\n3 It is possible Trump wants Ronny to do another sham exam. There is also the possibility that Trump is in a jam &amp; wants Ronny there to control the results other doctors get. By looking to Ronny, it may be a sign Trump's doctors are not going to play along with the health charade\\n4 Dementia patients have an initial time period where they can work &amp; live a normal life. Trump’s enablers extended his time in an executive role far beyond any rational measure. Grifters gotta grift &amp; this family, so bereft of integrity, needs him as Pres to maximize their grift\\n5 Trump is in denial. He will never admit to Dementia. Even when he’s in a wheelchair &amp; can’t speak the Trumpsters will claim it’s something else. Dementia to Trump, would end his greatness. Ivanka &amp; the rest of them must know what’s happening, but if they act, they are at risk.\\n6 I suspect Dr Harold Bornstein saw it or gave him softened bad news like “they are just senior moments, stay active”. Doctors don’t like to destroy patients hopes. Knowing dementia moves slowly at first, they will tone down the alarm &amp; eventually give a referral to a neurologist\\n7 Normally the public would not be diagnosing Trump from afar. It’s usually a private matter- the patient lightens their load and withdraws from public life. What we have with Trump is a unique spectacle- a TV President in mid stage dementia with an active cover up taking place.\\n8 He’s not faking. His symptoms go way back. I saw it when he announced his run. They are obvious &amp; extreme now. Don’t worry he’s not getting off. He doesn’t have a legal guardian yet &amp; he committed all his crimes when he knew of a concept some people follow called right vs wrong\\n9 Dementia didn’t make Trump a narcissistic criminal &amp; traitor. He is a narcissistic criminal &amp; traitor who developed dementia. He will be held responsible &amp; won’t escape punishment. The evil in his soul is laid bare by dementia, while most sociopaths are better at concealing it\\n10 Trump’s dementia became much more obvious at the G7 in June 2018. This thread within a thread has a large amount of further detail.     https://t.co/vGMjyE22kc\\n11 Trump's dementia, as expected, was even more pronounced in Paris this fall, where he mostly stayed in his room and made this wobbly walk from his limo. Balance issues will steadily worsen and lead to a wheelchair. \\nhttps://t.co/3wEKi3dUqW\\n12 Trump has new recent symptoms of dementia. He’s not just slurring, he can’t form certain sounds at all and drops the entire syllable when speaking. Like this:  https://t.co/gj2HFDGkXA\\n13 He is losing his memory now. He couldn’t remember Michael Cohen’s father-in-law’s name in one interview. Days later, in another interview he couldn’t remember what he said about the father-in-law. “I did have to read what I said. What did I say? I don’t know. What did I say?”\\n14 Trump is dominated by dementia now. We are also dominated by it. The majority of the news is really about Trump’s aberrant behavior. Stop and think about that. Here’s a fresh list of Trump’s obvious dementia symptoms: https://t.co/soqjMPkt2S\\n15 What is it? Frontotemporal Dementia has a few sub forms. I suspect his is PSP- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. It takes a neurological exam, workup, baseline, MRI &amp; time comparison to nail it down. Without getting in to Tau protein info, basically brain cells steadily die off.\\n16 The public will eventually learn the diagnosis. Once Trump is yanked from office, his lawyers may try to leverage it with home detention before trial, instead of the specially built prison/nursing home setup that he will live his remaining days in. He remains a security risk.\\n17 Trump is being propped up by:\\n-A WH that has become a luxury assisted living center.\\n-Enablers who want to extend their own positions &amp; priorities\\n-Probably a drug cocktail like Memantine, Levodopa, Zoloft for memory movement &amp; mood.\\n-The Adderall rumors are probably true too.\\n18 A message for the Media: You are missing a big one. The reporter that exposes the coverup of Trump's health issues will have a bombshell story. The drugs, the enablers, the near disasters. Even Ronny doing a venogram &amp; neck ultrasound after a slurring incident was glossed over\\n19 END Eventually Trump will become incapacitated. Clinically said, the prognosis is poor. There are zero dementia survivors on the planet. It steadily worsens w/ no remission. Drugs don't work. The outcome is set no matter what Ronny or anyone else does. Dementia always wins out\",\n",

It was a few days before I took a vacation. A private eye I knew – Bill – called me. He said he found something big. It felt clandestine.\\nI liked Bill, but I didn’t exactly trust him. He was a long-winded 70-something curmudgeon with a gravely voice who always told stories about his own greatness. (We have that in common.). With Bill, it was hard to tell truth from a boast. But I was so intrigued.\\nI drive to Bill’s house. His home office is a wild mess – weird electronics and case files and shotgun shells are scattered across his desk. I can’t remember if he had a claymore or if that was Ron Swanson. Maybe both.\\nBill hands me a tube of prescription skin cream. (It looks like the blue creams in this photo.) I notice the name on the tube is not Bill. This is someone else\\'s medicine. Bill says the cream is worth thousands of dollars. I roll my eyes. https://t.co/H6cqdcs02X\\nBill tells me a story. He says he stumbled upon a conspiracy where doctors in Tennessee are prescribing bullshit pain/scar cream to Marines in California. He thinks the goal is to defraud the government. Bill says he is working with the feds to catch these people.\\nI don’t buy it. I think Bill either discovered nothing or inflated his role in a small investigation. But I interview him just in case. Proof, he says, will come from a whistleblower lawsuit, but suit will be sealed for a while. I have to believe him, he says. I don\\'t.\\nThen Bill says something that sticks with me. The Tennessee doctor is named Susy. He says this twice: “Who has ever heard of a doctor named Susy?” I’m insulted. My mother, a bad ass who could do anything, is named Susan.\\nI thank Bill and leave. I go on vacation to attend the wedding of one of my best friends. We are drunk and merry. I forget all about the pain cream. I go back to work and focus on other stories.\\nIt is now 2018. After years of covering cops in the California desert, I got a new job as the health care reporter at The Tennessean in Nashville. I\\'m out of my element and I\\'m scared. I decide to work twice as hard so no one will notice.\\nI start reading all our old health stories, studying my new home and my new beat. One night, I come across a short, forgettable story about two doctors at an East Tennessee clinic who confessed to defrauding the military with pain cream. https://t.co/Wdj8chyjHg\\nOne of the doctors is Susan Vergot. She goes by Susy. \\n\\n\"Who\\'s ever heard of a doctor named Susy?\"\\nI read everything I can find about her case. It turns out Susan Vergot and another doctor, Carl Lindblad, prescribed needless pain cream to California Marines to defraud a military insurance program called Tricare.\\nThe creams cost $14,000, each. The whole scam cost the America taxpayer about $65 million. It was just like Bill said, only bigger than he knew.\\nBy now, Bill’s whistleblower lawsuit is unsealed. It shows he communicated with the feds about the creams I saw in his home office back in 2015. A federal investigation into the conspiracy began 3 weeks after he handed over the creams to NCIS. Bill was right. It was true.\\nAs of today, four people have pleaded guilty in this cream case – two doctors, a nurse practitioner and an ex-Marine. Three more suspects have been charged. More indictments are likely. The feds are also trying to seize property in East Tennessee, including this mansion estate. https://t.co/4JaKmMiQqH\\nOther journalists have published good articles on this case over the past few years, but nobody has the details in the story we published this morning. I’d be honored if you read it. https://t.co/hDqk5pTtge\\nAlso, there is a lesson here for young journalists: Don’t dismiss the weirdos and SAVE YOUR NOTES. I was only able to write this story because I went to Bill\\'s house in 2015 and still had my notes from our interview years ago. @Poynter\\nThanks for going on this journey with me. As always, buy a damn newspaper subscription already. https://t.co/ogRc82YsAq',\n",
       " 'hilo 28': 'New: In weeks before the Syria decision, national security adviser John Bolton instructed senior officials to meet directly with coalition partners and assure them the US is “staying in Syria until Iran is out of Syria,” two sources tell CNN. 1/\\n2/Syria withdrawal was “a complete reversal,” done “without deliberation\" and \"no consideration of risks.” Allies and partners are “shocked and totally bewildered”, Syrian Democratic Forces “don’t believe this is happening,” a senior administration official familiar tells me.\\n3/Decision comes at critical time in fight against ISIS, with US military &amp; partners “in a Tora Bora situation” in N.

       " 'hilo 280': 'Leaving a big company job for a startup can rejuvenate your career and make you love work again.💖\\n\\nBut landing a startup job requires relearning some things, especially if (like me) you logged years and years at Microgoogfaceforceazon.\\n\\nHere are six things I wish I\\'d known:\\n1) At a startup, you will probably make less money at first.\\n\\nYes, if you join the perfect startup early enough, your equity may someday turn into a private island and 200 foot yacht. But, in the meantime, your take home pay is likely going to be a bit less than it is now.\\nThe so-called “golden handcuffs” that big companies give you in stock grants/bonuses that vest over time are because those companies need to overpay you in order to get you to stay.\\n\\nThink about the metaphor for a second: You don\\'t have to handcuff people to things they love.\\nYou can make a great living at a startup of course, and growth stage startups in particular pay competitively and often with fantastic benefits. \\n\\nBut if optimizing for the most take home cash is your #1 priority, keep your job. Seriously… it’s ok. Startups are not for everyone.\\n2) About your resume: if you’ve been at a big company for a long time, you really need to figure out what experiences you’ve had that show depth outside of that company.\\n\\nWrote apps for an unfamiliar platform? Started a nonprofit? Ran a successful Kickstarter campaign? All great.\\nWhen I left Microsoft after 16 years, I had worked on what seemed to me to be a dizzying array of roles and products. Within Microsoft, that was compelling.\\n\\nTo the external world, it was just 16 monolithic years at MSFT and everyone asked pointedly: why didn’t you leave sooner?\\nAlso, leave off whatever “high potential” programs you were selected to, or awards you won inside of the megacorp. Same with review scores.\\n\\nThose don’t matter on the outside, and just show that you\\'re still deeply entrenched in the value system of the company you\\'re leaving.\\n3) Here’s something it took me a long time to learn on the outside: say “I” instead of “we.”\\n\\nWorking for @stevesi at MSFT, I learned an incredibly important lesson about leading inside of a large team: always say “we did this” not “I did this.” Perfect advice for that situation.\\nWhen interviewing, though, saying “we did this\" makes it hard to identify your personal contribution.\\n\\nI find myself talking to megacorp candidates trying to understand what did *they* do? What specific designs did they draw… what code did they write… what ideas were theirs?\\nBut also, don’t claim personal accomplishment for a team effort unless you provably did it. You probably didn’t “bring AI to iOS” yourself.\\n\\nYou didn’t “create the Windows 7 kernel” or “increase S3’s scalability 400%” yourself.\\n\\nSpecify *your* actual contribution to the product.\\n4) For devs: show true curiosity outside of your company’s stack. Your mastery of Google’s internal experimentation pipeline is not interesting outside of Google. If you are MSFT and I ask you if you’ve used Redis and you say “you mean Azure Redis Cache?”, that’s not a good sign.\\nThis means if you work for Amazon, build something on DigitalOcean. Googler? Build with React. From Microsoft? Get into AWS.\\n\\nThe best big company devs we’ve hired are the ones with natural, proven technical curiosity outside of their company’s native stack, shown by actual work.\\nDon’t say the reason you want to join a startup is “to have a chance to learn XYZ technology.” Learn and build with the tech you are curious about yourself… your company is not in control of your learning. Prove that you’re curious by actions, not words.\\n5) Be a worker… and be prepared to show it.\\n\\nBig companies are necessarily full of people whose primary job it is to carry information from one meeting to another, from one department to another. Middle managers and PMs, in particular, are often defined by this type of work.\\nStartups don’t have this kind of “info pusher” job. They can’t afford to, and they’re not big enough to need it. Everyone is responsible for making something, building product, owning decisions, selling something, hustling. You can’t just show up at the meeting and “seem senior.”\\nBig company folks sometimes flame out at startups because this kind of individual work is not what they actually want. No judgment from me or anyone else if it’s not… be honest with yourself about the degree to which you want to be on the frontlines, making or selling things.\\n6) Embrace the unique skills you developed in a big company. No one builds more reliable software at scale than Amazon or Google… this knowledge can be a huge boon to a startup. Salesforce perfected solution-based selling; this may help scale your SaaS startup’s sales expertise.\\nDon’t feel like you have to be on your back foot or defensive about your time at a megacorp.\\n\\nIt took me a year out of Microsoft to realize that so much of what I learned there was applicable in my new startup job—i just needed to learn to apply it in a different environment.\\nThere’s a whole world out here, free from the walls of your megacorp job.\\n\\nEnter into it for the right reasons, and you\\'ll find joining a startup to be truly transformative for your career and rejuvenating for your soul.\\n\\nPrepare for it the right way, and you too can join us! 🙌',\n",
       " 'hilo 281': \"I spent the last 15yrs in US in enterprise engg/product/venture @AMD, @Google &amp; @a16z before returning to India. I'm often asked how India compares to SV hot-bed of enterprise innovation. Besides US, I feel world-class enterprise startups will come from India &amp; here's why 👇:\\n1/n First, some market truths - more and more unicorns are now found outside of the US. Primary reason: internet penetration. https://t.co/HQE0dzvza3\\n2/n Strong correlation exists between internet availability and affordability to large pools of value creation. The story that played out in US &amp; China b/w 2000-2018 is starting to play out in India now. But aren’t these mostly B2C companies like Google/FB? https://t.co/K3y080fKka\\n3/n Internet penetration has benefited B2C but has 2nd order impact on B2B. For every Dropbox or Facetime, there’s also a Box or Zoom using digital tools to build, test, &amp; launch at breakneck speeds  &amp; then  in “consumerish ways” brands, sell, &amp; monetize enterprises.\\n4/n “Developer is the new buyer” -- think fewer site-wide MSDN or RHEL licenses, more personal/team-wide Github/Slack/digitalOcean accounts. Corporate IT spend will disaggregate and many top-down decisions will turn bottoms-up where individual “consumer” needs to be influenced.\\n5/n Founders w/ dev-first mindset will win big globally &amp; Indian founders have a unique advantage here: our developer ecosystem is one of the most vibrant in the world. We are curious, engaged, &amp; hungry to learn. Being a techie in India isn’t “geeky/nerdy”, it’s cool, fashionable https://t.co/dxQzL93Jvh\\n6/n But wait a minute? Isn’t India the call center / BPO capital of the world? You would be right.. 15-20 years ago. Simpson has a hilarious take on it. https://t.co/OdwAPJ0W5h\\n7/n If you’ve been following the India story since the late 90s, the top students from IITs were going into BPO/KPO roles at firms like Infosys/EvalueServe, etc. By late 2000s, India had started to shift squarely to product w/ companies like InMobi / Exotel paving the way https://t.co/64fJ90GSTf\\n8/n And now India is very SaaS focused, built and delivered on the cloud, and not just that, our enterprise solutions have... https://t.co/5hprhznDoo\\n9/n ...gone global from humble beginnings in Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, etc. E.g. - postman just raised a massive 300M round w/ huge developer adoption. Browserstack has seen fantastic growth, &amp; Freshworks hit 100M ARR last year (public sources): https://t.co/rKeL0NGMel\\n10/n By itself, India is now the 2nd largest public cloud buyer in APAC, ~50% of China &amp; growing faster. Vs China, the Indian buyer is hungrier &amp; doesn’t care for brand or roadmap (so, ideal for startups), is more top-line focused &amp; trying to get more process-driven to scale. https://t.co/7wkz2JahCk\\n11/n With a lot of headroom yet to grow - almost 90B of IT spend overall, much of it in devices and services that are bound to get eaten by software in coming years… https://t.co/oEFLvGvisc\\n12/n ...which is where, as you would expect, most of the growth is coming from (note: this is just the public cloud consumption data; pvt clouds may be multiples): https://t.co/gKqQttOVLC\\n13/n While India-to-US has been tried before successfully, India now has the potential to be the Enterprise / SaaS hub for local and SEA markets. Why? https://t.co/B9dM8BDTt2\\n14/n  China enterprise cos are either h/w focused or serve local markets. Meanwhile, rest of SEA has strong cultural, language AND use-case alignment w/ India given history &amp; development stage (gig-based, migrant population, etc). Works in India? Can work there.\\n15/n and to support all this value creation, the key pieces are coming together nicely. Vast majority of founders now have prior startup experience -- this is where many of the smartest people are headed -- not banking, consulting, or Google/FB. https://t.co/ppAGVnVMED\\n16/n and governmental reforms across taxation, ease of doing business, payments, and updated bankruptcy codes are providing additional tailwinds and making it easier for founders to take more risks and fail gracefully: https://t.co/tMY9Y4xpNY\\n17/n \\xa0Results? Large companies picking India as their 1st international market, while indian cos going global both in consumer &amp; enterprise - e.g. @lightspeedIndia portcos @innovaccer (US) &amp; @oyorooms (China, US, etc), &amp; @theDarwinbox &amp; @YellowMssngrAI getting inbounds frm SEA https://t.co/h2FjmD8nId\\n18/n Indian enterprise founders have tasted blood. They are hungry, experimental, and live/breathe tech. The next 10 years in India are going to be really exciting for enterprise founders! If you are building for a massive whitespace out of India, I’d love to hear from you\",\n",

       " 'hilo 284': 'Exposing Jonathan, “Jonah,” Hicap, the writer behind the Metro UK article \"confirming\" BTS\\' 24-hour views for Fake Love, a thread https://t.co/65qS4s8u5Z\\nWe\\'re all familiar with the infamous article out of nowhere that cited a \"Youtube spokesperson,\" everyone took as fact.\\n\\nFor starters, Metro is a widely considered by the general public NOT to be a reputable source (browse this reddit thread: https://t.co/UgENWy37zx).\\nSo who is this \"Jonathan Hicap”?\\n\\nApparently someone who does NOT have connections with YouTube, if his tweets are anything to go by. This is him back when ‘FAKE LOVE’ was released: https://t.co/O2kBktj3gd\\nThis is incredibly sketchy—someone who has a direct line of contact with YouTube would not need to @ them on Twitter. In addition, his public email is a Gmail, which I can assure you from personal experience does not hold as much weight as one from an established institution.\\nYouTube very rarely gives official statements, and especially never to a reporter from an outlet like Metro. So that’s already strike one.\\nYet, less than 24 hours later, he publishes an article “confirming” FL views by a “YouTube spoksperson.” \\n\\nNote that the first mention is plural, “reps for YouTube” and the second is singular, “THE spokesperson.” He also inconsistently put a space between a number and ‘million.’ https://t.co/L5052FA4OM\\nThese inconsistencies might seem minor, but they can actually function as cues to detect when someone is lying. Just compare that quote an actual one from a YT spokesperson; there is a glaringly stark difference between the sophistication of the language employed. https://t.co/8enoNhyoCk\\nLiterally all the articles confirming FL’s 24-hour views from that point on either cites the Metro article or casually throws out “officially” with no source. https://t.co/LHZk4LqrfV\\nThe only time I could find YT putting out an official confirmation for the first 24-hour views was for PSY’s ‘Gentleman’ back in 2013 when he shattered the previous record.

       " 'hilo 285': '1/ Let\\'s talk about how misinfo can spread from failure to fact-check representations of academic research in journalism. This thread is about false claims made about the number of women who seek \"late-term\" abortions due to maternal health and/or fetal anomaly.\\n2/ A few days ago, @DouthatNYT tweeted that most 3rd trimester abortions were not sought due to maternal health/fetal anomaly &amp; cited a 2013 paper to support this claim. https://t.co/jlKkdogfWZ\\n3/ This claim was problematic for a # of reasons, the most important one being that women who sought abortions for health and/or fetal abnormality were EXCLUDED from the study. \\n\\nSecondarily, the mean time of abortion was 22 weeks, which is in the second trimester, not the third. https://t.co/rGE0CI6b79\\n4/ Here is a link to the 2013 study: https://t.co/xToyeaMG9C https://t.co/c74dqkKjAy\\n5/ Then, today, @xan_desanctis, of @TheAtlantic, repeated Douthat’s false claim, linking to the same 2013 research paper. Notably, she lifts a quote from the paper\\'s lit review that is *not* a description of the paper\\'s findings. https://t.co/j45OuiVPDL https://t.co/cJPkqip5Li\\n6/ After I pointed out that the 2013 paper couldn\\'t draw these conclusions bc abortions due 2 maternal health/fetal anomaly were EXCLUDED from the sample, the dregs of twitter put on their genius caps &amp; said, “Well the study says in the lit review that other research found that!” https://t.co/zG00RclI0c\\n7/ So, a few things: you should not copy and paste claims from a study’s lit review &amp; cite them as the source for those research findings b/c\\n\\n1st: that’s not how citations work. \\n\\n2nd: Lit reviews often contain errors &amp; misrepresentations of other research.\\n\\n3rd: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄.\\n8/ But given this misrepresentation is especially pernicious, I decided to do a public service &amp; fact-check the citations. Plz note I was only able to do this b/c I have a subscription to academic data bases. The research is not available w/out one\\n\\nSo, what did I find? . . . .\\n9/ The 2013 lit review’s representation of the previous research WAS flawed. Specifically, the claim that “data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment” is not supported by citations #5 OR #21. https://t.co/Ql150nmKJY\\n10/ Citation #5: This study examined abortion incidence, as well as ability to access abortions by region. The researchers also looked at prevalence of harassment at clinics. https://t.co/VBFCzXEIAw\\n11/ The researchers did NOT collect data on gestational age! \\n\\nNor did they report data on *reasons* for seeking an abortion, such as fetal anomaly. \\n\\nThis means that one cannot draw ANY conclusions about EITHER of these factors from this paper. https://t.co/6N104euRLZ\\n12/ So, again: don’t copy &amp; paste from lit reviews.\\n13/ Okay, on to the next cited study (ref #21): “Attitudes and Decision Making Among Women Seeking Abortions at One U.S. Clinic.”\\n\\nDo the results from THIS study support the claims about reasons for seeking \"later term\" abortions? \\n\\nShort answer: NO. https://t.co/hUi32Vc9FG\\n14/ This study looked at whether or not women had high/low confidence in their decision to have an abortion. This was the dependent variable. \\n\\nThe independent variables included demographics (age/race, etc), as well as spiritual beliefs, having a supportive partner, etc. https://t.co/v42gCi2zWi\\n15/ The presence of fetal anomaly WAS included as a variable. \\n\\nHowever, again, this study was not investigating REASONS for obtaining an abortion. It was looking at the effect of the above variables on *confidence* in the decision.\\n16/ Nor was the effect of fetal anomaly *ever* investigated by *time* of abortion. \\n\\nThere is *no* possible way to examine whether fetal anomaly or maternal health was a reason for seeking a second or third trimester abortion from the data in this study.\\n17/ So, overall, let\\'s be clear: \\n\\nRegardless of what these two studies found, both Douthat &amp; DeSanctis misrepresented the original 2013 research they were citing. This was the paper that excluded maternal health/fetal anomaly from the study. \\n\\n*This* is the primary issue. https://t.co/Y3fcb4lIaT\\n18/ Second, neither of the studies cited in the 2013 paper found what the authors claimed they had found. I don’t want to excuse this error, but I will say this is VERY COMMON in academic research.\\n19/ Which is why your professors try SO HARD to teach you when you are a freshman in college to check PRIMARY SOURCES. \\n\\nThis means: don’t copy &amp; paste claims from lit reviews.\\n20/ @DouthatNYT should delete his tweets &amp; the @nytimes should issue a statement that one of their columnists was spreading misinformation on the internet\\n\\n@TheAtlantic should tell @xan_desanctis to correct her article\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t be on *readers* to fact-check journalistic orgs',\n",
       " 'hilo 286': 'Certainly his disease was part of why the public knew of Stephen Hawking. But his most famous result is important and amazing. Let me tell you about it.\\n\\n(note: this is all from before my time, so I\\'m telling the simplified story)\\nWell before Hawking, we understand the existence of black holes as a gravitational body. They are a solution to Einstein\\'s General Relativity field equations; the unique solution for a point mass.\\nBut there was a problem: black holes are the unique solution, so there appears to be only one state of \"a black hole\" for a given mass (and spin and charge). That means that a black hole should have zero entropy.\\nAnd that\\'s a problem, because that means that you could reduce the entropy of the Universe by throwing a system with non-zero entropy into a black hole. And there\\'s one law we don\\'t want to break, its the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics: entropy always increases.\\nSo, you can say \"ok, we don\\'t know how the entropy comes about, but let\\'s just declare that black holes have entropy. Problem solved.\" (and we still don\\'t know \"where\" the entropy of black holes is coming from). Hawking was part of formalizing this.\\nBut that introduces a new problem\\n\\nA system with non-zero entropy has a temperature. And things with temperature MUST radiate. But how does that work?\\n\\nAfter all, the notable property of black holes is their blackness: nothing escapes. So how can they radiate?\\nHawking figured out how to resolve this conflict. What he figured out how to do was calculate the quantum field theory near the edge of a black hole (right outside the event horizon).\\nFar from a black hole, spacetime is \"flat\" and you can calculate the configuration of quantum fields that we think of as \"the vacuum\" (empty space). \\n\\nYou can do the same thing for \"empty space\" near the edge of a black hole.\\nHowever, what Hawking did was show that the \"empty space/vacuum\" configuration near the event horizon was *different* from the one far from the black hole.\\nMoreover if you started with fields in the vacuum configuration near the black hole, far from the black hole, they\\'d look exactly like a thermally radiating system.\\nThat is, by bending spacetime, the black hole made the vacuum itself radiate away energy. The source of this energy is the black hole\\'s mass, and eventually this process (Hawking radiation) would cause the black hole to evaporate.\\nAnd there is still so much we don\\'t understand about what all this means. We still don\\'t really know where the entropy of a black hole is coming from. But Hawking made the connection explicit: there is a black hole entropy, it\\'s proportional to the surface area, and it\\'s enormous\\nFurther, Hawking did a calculation that mixes general relativity and quantum field theory. We often talk about these two theories as incompatible (and thus: string theory), but in limited cases you can calculate with both. Hawking did it.\\n(There\\'s another way to describe Hawking radiation as \"virtual particles near the horizon, one falls in, the other escapes.\" That\\'s not even really morally incorrect, but its slightly more accurate to think of the vacuum changing.)\\nAnyway, Hawking radiation allows one to show that the maximum entropy ANY volume can have is the entropy of a black hole contained in the volume. Since the entropy of a black hole is set by the surface area, this means the maximum entropy of a volume goes like the area.\\nThat\\'s sort of nuts, because it means if I make a room 2x larger in each dimension, I can fit 2^3=8 times as much stuff, but only 2^2=4 times as much entropy (\"information\" loosely speaking).\\nSo somehow, the information in volume is encoded in the surface area of the volume. This is the \"holographic principle\" and I don\\'t think we have a great idea of what it means about how our Universe is put together.\\nAnyway, Hawking radiation is a fascinating thing. And it is the opening step in a really interesting area of physics that seems to be saying something very deep about how the Universe works. I\\'m not sure what.\\nHawking was a great scientist. The world might not have known of him had he never suffered from his illness, but they should have. \\n\\nJust wanted to talk a bit about his work.\\nHawking radiation wasn\\'t the only thing he\\'s done. But it\\'s maybe his most famous (and the easiest for me to try to explain)',\n",
       " 'hilo 287': \"THREAD. Emma Gonzales is president of the Gay-Straight Alliance. [1] \\n\\nI was president of my GSA too, then organized LGBTQ youth on the early internet, then studied adolescent psych at Harvard. I've got something to say about high-school GSAs in America. 1/\\nA GSA serve three purposes: support, education, and activism. \\n\\nSUPPORT means it is a safe place to be yourself if you are LGBTQ. You can meet other LGBTQ kids and allies there, as well as safe adults. You can make friends who will love you for who you are. 2/\\nThis is important because LGBTQ youth are at higher risk than their straight peers for drug abuse, sexual exploitation, and suicide [2] largely because they are far more likely to lose parental support before they have the maturity and resources to make it on their own. 3/\\n40% of homeless youth in the US are LGBTQ. [3] Having accepting friends can be the difference between a place to stay and survival prostitution, and in dark moments is the difference between life and death. 4/\\nEDUCATION means teaching your fellow students who aren’t in the GSA - and let’s be real, usually your teachers and even counselors - what it is like to be a young LGBTQ person. 5/\\nPeople have weird ideas about this: they could think bi means you’re trying to have sex with everyone, or that gay means you are going to prey on children. You can lean on statistics and expert sources, but the most effective education is putting yourself out there. 6/\\nYou have to allow yourself to be seen so that your entire being can make the point “I’m more like you than you realize. My life has value just like yours does.” And GSA kids do this in conversations, newspaper columns, and in-class speeches all the time. 7/\\nSidebar: I’ve spent the last 10 years working in the tech industry, and I've been sent to “leadership narrative” classes where executive coaches explain the value of storytelling to create empathy and motivate change. Duh. I learned that lesson at 16 in the GSA! 8/\\nACTIVISM, the most important purpose of the GSA. It’s not enough to console each other about the indignities or violences of being LGBTQ in high school, and it’s not enough to explain yourself to others and ask for their kindness. 9/\\nActivism means seizing the reins and changing things. Because when you are LGBTQ, changing things is a survival skill. 10/\\nThe same tactics you use to convince the Winter Formal Committee to be inclusive of same-sex couples will serve you in adulthood when you have to convince your employer to extend benefits to your partner, or convince your corporation to adequately cover trans healthcare. 11/\\nYou can organize for changes in your school and your community, and in doing so you can understand yourself in the context of other human struggles for civil rights and dignity. You find solidarity with other marginalize people whose struggles are the same but also different. 12/\\nYou learn to organize across race and class to form stronger movements that include everyone. You learn that you get better results by pushing those most directly impacted to the front, and passing the mic to those whose voices we hear the least. 13/\\nI see this strategy in how the #ParklandStudents were able to be everywhere: in DC, at the Florida state house, at Rubio's town hall, in the NYTimes. They always passed the mic around and used their diverse personal stories to hammer the same point over and over again. 14/\\nStudent activism in GSAs builds lifelong skills, but it’s also about survival because **activism is a way through trauma.** And here’s the thing: everyone I know who came out in their teenage years experienced trauma. 15/\\nI saw friends lose their homes and their families. I lost friends to suicide. I knew a girl who was raped in order to “cure” her of being gay.  I knew a boy who was beaten, nearly to death, for holding hands with another boy. All before I was 20. 16/\\nThe core teaching of GSAs is that in these moments of pain, when you feel powerless and beaten down by the brokenness of the world, you can do something. You can take your pain, your grief, and your rage, and you can roll it out into the world as change. 17/\\nWhen you take unfathomable losses you can’t undo what’s happened but you can fight on for your fallen friends, in their names, until you fix it for younger people. You can save someone else. And in saving them, you can save yourself. 18/\\nI see this in the #ParklandStudents and I understand what is fueling them, and because of that, I believe in them with all my heart. Those of us who are older can form up behind them with our resources and our networks, or get out of their way. 19/\\nFrom this 31 year old former student activist to @Emma4Change, @davidhogg111, @sarahchad_ and all their friends and classmates: ride on you beautiful survivors. Take your pain, roll it out into the world, and show us the way. [end]\",\n",

I quote this reference thread only because it has a lot of other threads ensconced within it. https://t.co/MYB6bDPgma\\n3. @SharylAttkisson wrote today about a \"sensitive matter team\" which included James Comey and his chief of staff James Rybicki. \\nThat sensitive matter was most likely the Trump-Russia story/narrative.\\n4. Recently obtained emails by Justice department IG referred to the existence of this \"sensitive matter team\"\\nThese emails were turned over to Senate Homeland Sec Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, who wrote to FBI Director Chris Wray asking for identity of all members of this team\\n5. On Jan 6, 2017, Comey\\'s chief of staff Rybicki emailed unidentified recipients:  “[Director Comey] is coming to HQ briefly now for an update on the sensitive matter team.” https://t.co/enftMwGFHs\\n6.  Later that day Comey briefed President-elect Trump on some of the salacious, unverified allegations in the Steele dossier. The next day, Comey outlined this briefing in an email to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI General Counsel James Baker and Chief of Staff Rybicki\\n7. Here is where things get really, really interesting, Comey wrote to the other 3 members of his cadre: \\n\"I said there was something [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper wanted me to speak to [President Elect Trump] about alone or in a very small group,”\\n8. Comey continued “I then executed the session exactly as I had planned…I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook.”\\nSo, Comey is laying out what he said to Trump, describing how things went.\\n9. Of course, currently DNI clapper works at CNN, like Asha Rangappa, Josh Campbell to name a few. (Both take decidedly anti-Trump stances at CNN)\\nA day later, Jan. 8, McCabe emailed Comey and Rybicki with the subject title: “Flood is coming.”\\nRead it again: \"Flood is coming:\\n10. “CNN is close to going forward with the sensitive story,” McCabe wrote. “The trigger for them is they know the material was discussed in the [presidential] brief and presented in an attachment.”\\n11.

On Jan. 10, CNN published a story headlined, “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.” The same day, BuzzFeed News published the contents of the “Steele dossier.”\\n13. Of course James Clapper famously said to Congress he never discussed the Steele Trump-Russia Dossier with journalists. Then, in an abrupt volte-face acknowledged discussing it with CNN journalist Jake Tapper https://t.co/xc3FjwDeae\\n14. To recapitulate: Comey, McCabe, Clapper et al were a part of a \"sensitive matter team\". They leaked this story to CNN, who then published it. At the same time, buzzfeed published the Dossier in its entirety. \\nClapper would later go on to be employed by CNN.\\n15. If the impact of this story is not readily felt by you, I suggest you sit down, read #14 yet again then go back to #1 and re-read the whole thread before continuing further. \\nIt is absolutely astounding that Comey/McCabe et al hacked away at the very foundation of democracy\\n16.

John McCain seemed to be pivotal in this stage of dissemination and propagation of the false narrative. \\nThe December 2016 memo started by taking about Michael Cohen being in Prague (which NEVER really happened) and then continued to propound multitudinous falsehoods.\\n18. What you have here is a concerted effort with active and contemporaneous co-operation between politicians, elements in the intelligence community and news media to subvert democracy and overthrow an entire presidency. \\nThis simply because the president was not to their liking\\n19.

       " 'hilo 289': 'Every time I think I\\'m done with Virginia history, I get dragged back in. But here\\'s why Northam referring to the \"20. and Odd Negroes\" of 1619 is so problematic: An historiographical thread. 1/\\nThe idea that the first Africans in Virginia might have been indentured servants goes back a long ways. Oscar and Mary Handlin wrote an article about this in 1950. 2/\\nPart of what the Handlins were wrestling with was the early absence of laws about slavery and what constituted slave status. This is a problem for historians of Virginia and of the early English Caribbean as well. 3/\\nIt\\'s a chicken and egg problem: do laws enshrine practices that are already custom, or are laws aspirational, attempting to create the slaveholding world that wealthy Virginians wanted? 4/\\nSo you can see why some historians took both the absence of positive law regarding enslaved people and the fact that a few Africans did become free and set up their own households and made arguments about fluidity of status in the very early part of the 1600s. 5/\\nEdmund Morgan did this to an extent too in his 1975 American Slavery, American Freedom. Drake, Raleigh, and others saw enslaved people in SPanish territories and maroons as potential allies. 6/\\nThen in the 1970s and 1980s there was a big (and justified) push to see agency for enslaved people. In VA this took the form of a lot of curiosity about those early free blacks. So Breen and Innes\\'s book Myne Owne Ground, about the JOhnson, Driggus, Payne, &amp; other families... 7/\\nIt\\'s fascinating, the small cadre of interrelated free black families on the eastern shore. The problem is historians started to make these families typical. They weren\\'t. They were Exceptional. 8/\\nThere\\'s a reason they settled on the eastern shore, well away from most of the great tobacco grandees around Jamestown. They were looking to get away. And, ultimately, their efforts were unsuccessful. 9/\\nThe Johnsons eventually had to flee to Maryland. Emanuel Driggus might even have been reenslaved by the end of his life (mid-1670s) though the evidence is ambiguous. 10/\\nThe narrative of early fluidity and of the free blacks of the eastern shore has combined into a popular narrative of English/white innocence abt slavery. The English didn\\'t really know what they were doing. That slavery in this period was easily escapeable &amp; not a big deal. 11/\\nOf course there are plenty of historians (and plenty of historical evidence) countering that kind of position. Winthrop Jordan and his unthinking decision (1968). Mike Guasco\\'s Slaves and Englishmen (2014) really destroys that mythology. 12/\\nGuasco showed that the English knew A LOT about slavery when they ventured into the Atlantic. They wanted enslaved people in Virginia, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. There was no assumption of indentured servitude for Africans in 1619 in VA. 13/\\nThough some Africans were able to come to private arrangements with slaveholders early on, those arrangements became less and less possible QUITE QUICKLY. 14/\\nJohn Coombs has done quite a bit of work on this, hopefully his book will be out soon. Another book on this Ibram Kendi\\'s Stamped from the Beginning. 15/\\nWhile mid-twentieth-century historians were wrestling in good faith with the question of legal status of early Africans in the English Atlantic, there has been so much work done since then. The Africans-as-servants narrative is no longer tenable. 16/\\nThe \"20. and Odd Negroes\" of 1619 were not intended to be servants. (See both Sluiter and Thornton on this in the WMQ.) 17/\\nWhen Northam said this morning that those people were servants, he was not engaging an earlier historiography. He was engaging a narrative of white innocence, of Virginian innocence, a narrative that slavery wasn\\'t that bad. 18/\\nNortham joins a long line of people who want to maintain white innocence about race and slavery by equating slavery and indentured servitude. That\\'s a bad idea, esp since this year white Virginians has an opportunity to honestly confront a pretty horrifying past. 19/\\nTL;DR: the Africans who arrived in Virginia in 1619 were not indentured servants. Saying they were deliberately effaces the long and violent history of slavery in Virginia and elsewhere. fin/',\n",

But it is also incredibly crucial, because without this info, you have no idea what kind of situation you are potentially walking into.\\nYou would never ask this question at a megacorp because, well, the answer is usually \"infinite money.\" The cash position of a public company is also usually freely available. Besides, you probably wouldn\\'t be talking to someone who could give you a direct answer anyway! 🤑\\nBut at a startup, everything is impacted by money. For example:\\n\\n* How free is the company to build towards its vision?\\n* How likely is the leadership to make desperate/rash decisions?\\n* Will you have access to the resources you need to do a good job?\\nThere are lots of less-gosh ways to ask this question, like: \"how strong is the company\\'s financial position?\"\\n\\nAnd be prepared, the answer might sound more like \"here\\'s what % of our Series B is still in the bank\" or \"here\\'s how many more months of runway we have.\" These are ok!\\nBut by not asking, you have no idea what you are signing up for.\\n\\nAnd if a founder/senior member of the team isn\\'t willing to give you *some sort of answer here*, that is a big red flag. They may be hiding something you won\\'t find out about until you start work.\\n2) Tell me about a time the founders disagreed. What happened?\\n\\nIn any startup with multiple founders (most of them!) the founder working relationship can make or break the company. If it is wonderful, the company may thrive whereas if it is toxic, nothing can save it.\\nNotice the phrasing of the question. As a candidate, just like as an interviewer, you must practice behavioral interviewing. \\n\\nDon\\'t ask \"how do the founders handle disagreement?\" Any smart person can answer that well: “They talk, hear each other\\'s perspectives, and work it out!”\\nInstead ask the question the behavioral way: \"Tell me about a time...\" This forces the answer to be specific and real.\\n\\nFounders always have some disagreement; if they own that and show they know how to handle it, it is a powerful positive signal about the company.\\nNote: Be especially wary if you are interviewing with a founder and they repeatedly answer your specific questions about this by taking the topic back into the abstract.\\n\\nThis could show that they are not transparent, not self-aware, deceitful, or all three.\\n3) What is the role of the company’s board of directors?\\n\\nI\\'ll be honest. During the 16 years I worked at Microsoft, I am not sure I could have named anyone on the board. Bill Gates? The Netflix guy? 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️\\n\\nIt just wasn\\'t in any way germane to the day-to-day of working there.\\nIn a startup, however, the company\\'s relationship with its board could have a huge impact on whether you want to work there.\\n\\nIf you are talking to a founder or senior exec, look for words of alignment and respect. Not snark or 🙄 or \"ugh, the board, don\\'t get me started.”\\nIf interviewing with a more junior employee, a great answer might well be \"No idea, I’ve only seen them in the office once.”\\n\\nA board that is out of the way operationally, helping behind-the-scenes but not interfering, is a good sign that there\\'s a healthy relationship there.\\nFun story: I once interviewed for a senior job at a tech startup. I went with the CEO to meet the board for a last round of interviews.\\n\\nThe first board member got me into a room and started with: \"Hi!

A positive is often: \"wow, I can\\'t believe how much we\\'ve done/grown/changed/built when I think about it.\"\\n\\nA worrisome answer is \"honestly, it\\'s about the same.\" When startups stagnate, they die.\\nHear the stories about what the last 12 months were like, and use that to gauge whether it would be an exciting place to spend your next few years.\\n\\nCompanies that are thoughtfully growing employ people with a strong growth mindset, creating an amazing place to learn and build.\\nLast thing: Don\\'t be afraid to ask these things. 💪🏼 You have the right to ask direct questions in your interview.

       " 'hilo 291': '1/ Thoughts on Libra (and my first tweetstorm!):  first, zoom out for a second and realize how far this industry has come. The biggest companies in the world are now launching cryptocurrencies. BOOM.\\n2/ I know, I know, “it’s not a cryptocurrency!!!” some will yell.  Well, yes and no. Relative to PayPal or to the US dollar, Libra is very much a cryptocurrency.  Relative to Bitcoin or ZCash or DAI, Libra is not all that crypto-y.\\n3/ Libra deserves nuanced analysis, it is neither “great” nor “horrendous.” This brings up an important point too often missing in discussions of crypto: digital assets and blockchains have *many* attributes, optimizing for certain ones can detract from others, and that’s okay.\\n4/ Lots of blockchain projects will be created and played with while the world rebuilds the financial system upon this new technology. Different assets will serve different markets, at different times, in different ways.\\n5/ Libra will serve the mass market, and be the single largest bridge toward decentralized finance that has ever been built. Prior to this, the largest bridge was Coinbase, which has played an integral role in crypto’s rise.\\n6/ The Good: Libra is built on an actual blockchain (based on HotStuff BFT, similar but not identical to, and compatible with, Cosmos’ Tendermint protocol). Much/most of the important components are open-source and can be built on in a permissionless way.\\n7/ Next, Libra made the (great) decision to NOT back itself solely with USD. This has profound implications. Libra can arguably become a medium-term replacement to any single government fiat currency. Libra is, arguably, superior/above the US Government dollar.\\n8/ To whomever bravely navigated Facebook into creating a currency above the US dollar, kudos to you. That took balls and probably a lot of work. It was the right decision. I was worried FB Coin would just be a lame proxy for US dollar, and it is not.\\n9/ Next, Libra has the potential (and current plan) to go from “a little decentralized” on day one, to “moderately decentralized” within a few years of launch. The plan is clearly to gradually decentralize with time. Good plan, we’ll see if they can actually do it.\\n10/ Finally, and let’s not minimize this one, Libra has a good chance of helping hundreds of millions of people avoid middlemen fees and increase their wealth and financial sovereignty *relative to the status quo banking system* Humanitarians rejoice.\\n11/  Now the bad: Libra is clearly not a “pure cryptocurrency.” Nobody should expect privacy by using it. Nobody should expect the true borderless standard of most cryptos. Libra will never be available in Iran due to sanctions, for example.\\n12/ Next: the governing consortium can explicitly block/prevent txs. You won’t find unstoppable finance here. Again, in this, traditional cryptos are far superior. But let’s be realistic, there’s no way FB could create an unstoppable coin (at least, not in its 1st phase…)\\n13/ Next: Libra achieves stability (a critical feature for most normies) by backing the coin with a basket of a) government fiat, and b) government debt (bonds). Personally, I want nothing to do with either of these “assets.”\\n14/ Over the long term, any currency based on fiat will fail relative to hard assets (Bitcoin, gold, etc.) Politicians debase currency as their modus operandi, and thus if Libra maintains fiat backing it tend toward zero long term. BTC and “real” cryptos will crush it long term.\\n15/ Over the short/medium term, this relative stability derived by fiat/bond backing will enable Libra to capture marketshare and onboard literally hundreds of millions of people. They will be moving partially away from banks, and partially toward true decentralized finance.\\n16/ Libra, because it is *kinda* a cryptocurrency will *kinda* run up against many of the legal/regulatory challenges that real cryptos and crypto companies do. FB has the resources (and hopefully the balls) to fight some of the battles.\\n17/ Libra may also become the whipping boy of cryptocurrency. As the politicians of the world get irate at having their fiat supremacy challenged, they will call on FB to answer for it. These struggles, playing out over the coming years, will be fascinating.\\n18/ Libra has a chance, if they are brave and tactical over many years, to ultimately move away from a fiat basket toward either a real basket (BTC, gold, etc), or possibly just becoming a hard asset on its own (requiring knowable supply with zero or low debasement).\\n19/ Ultimately, Libra’s relationship with those of us in crypto will be mixed. It will be a love/hate relationship, and that’s okay. Libra is challenging the status quo of fiat more than it challenges true crypto, and will pull millions toward sound-er money long term.\\n20/ Anything that causes normal people to consider new forms of money (apart from their default position of \"my nation, my currency\") is a good thing. Libra will crack open further global discussion about what money is, and that sunshine will hurt fiat, and help all sound monies.',\n",

       " 'hilo 294': '1. THREAD: I am now POSITIVE that Michael Horowitz has the entire story, and is likely making criminal referrals. I haven\\'t done a thread in a while. Buckle up.\\n2. In an article I wrote on 1/31/19, I detailed for all of you what I thought the mysterious OIG Summary report released by Horowitz on 1/29 meant. https://t.co/Sn74N8tqKA This report is VITALLY IMPORTANT. https://t.co/pc46NxzOul\\n3. To summarize, the OIG found that AS A RESULT of conduct (likely DIRECTION or ORDERS) from senior level FBI officials, a government contractor engaged in inherent governmental activities- conduct prohibited by the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulations).\\n4. The \"inherent governmental activity\" I found that made sense was \"The direction and control of intelligence and counterintelligence operations\". I then went on to describe the 702 abuse. Contractors and the FBI Counterintelligence Division were routinely violating procedure\\n5. You can read that article here, and please give credit to @themarketswork where it is due- he has done amazing and extensive work on this issue and many more: https://t.co/JkOOovNUVe\\n6. After unpacking all of that, as we get further down in the report, we see that there is also a PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST violation by the contractor. This further solidified Fusion GPS for me, because Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS (cont)\\n7. (cont) and because of Bruce Ohr\\'s involvement in this FBI investigation, and because we had Jeff\\'s reporting on his testimony, I surmised that her marriage to Bruce Ohr represented a massive personal conflict of interest. https://t.co/BzriwX9tYG\\n8. Then I kept digging, and a few days later I found something AMAZING in a court transcript. The transcript was from a case involving FusionGPS. They took their bank to court to try to prevent the HPSCI from subpoenaing their bank records.\\n9. As part of their defense, they argued the subpoena was too expansive, and that if the government wanted records relating to Steele and the dossier, they would provide JUST THOSE and shouldn\\'t have to provide 2 years worth of financial transactions and records.\\n10. They argued that would be catastrophic for their business, as all of their clients would be revealed. It would also reveal what JOURNALISTS are on their payroll. Inside of the transcript and in response to that argument I found a STUNNING STATEMENT. https://t.co/uQpYg9sPkx\\n11. You can read my article about this here: https://t.co/gjag4gq2uW https://t.co/XpjvqNSWMs\\n12. The government attorney states: \"In addition, the committee is seeking to determine whether there are any connections between Fusion and the intelligence community, which is part of what this information would be designed to obtain\" WOW.\\n13. So now we know that as early as October of 2017, the HPSCI suspected that FusionGPS had a paid relationship with the IC. This finding further solidified the OIG summary report referencing FUSION GPS.\\n14. And yesterday we got the final confirmation. In John Solomon\\'s piece from yesterday, he uses VERY specific wording when speaking about Nellie Ohr, and the fact that she too handed her husband a thumb drive with information on Trump/Russia: https://t.co/72PeIRjlkM\\n15. Jeff had reported this previously (https://t.co/MlQcrjEaDr) however @jsolomonReports uses this language: (cont) https://t.co/HUnlC9HFWf\\n16. \"And now we learn, from testimony that is still being kept secret from the public, that Ohr admitted to Congress last year that he also took Russia information that his wife, Nellie, assembled against Trump on a computer drive and delivered that to the FBI in 2016...\" (cont)\\n17. (cont) \" — a revelation that has raised fresh concerns in Congress about a possible conflict of interest.\" It seems to me that the OIG has already found and determined that conflict of interest in his ongoing work into the FISA abuse AND THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OP as a WHOLE\\n18. It is also making me wonder if FusionGPS wasn\\'t being paid by the government TO COMMISSION the dossier, WHILE ALSO being paid by Clinton via Perkins Coie, and ALSO PAYING JOURNALISTS to write pieces to bolster their work. IN ADDITION\\n19. I posit that the CIA and Brennan will be making an entrance here in short order, given Nellie\\'s previous relationship with the organization. Brennan went to Reid, Reid went to Congress and Comey. Making sense now?\\n20. IT IS ALL COMING OUT and I am CONFIDENT there will be accountability.

       " 'hilo 296': 'Thread:\\n\\nI’ve seen a ton of people in the last week - men and women - calling for access to weapons or martial arts training as a response to sexual violence. I get it. It’s an attractive thought. Arm the women so they can have a chance to ‘fight back’, right? Wrong. Here’s why.\\nFirstly, weapons are unreliable as mechanisms to resist violence. What they’re likely to do more than anything is to escalate situations. Preservation of life is always our first instinct. Your rapist might not be planning to kill you, but weapons make it more likely they will.\\nSecondly, people who advocate for the use of weapons do so with the ridiculous assumption that we’ll be able to use them with a clear head and, most importantly, accuracy. Even people trained in the use of weapons struggle with both these things.\\nYou want a woman who has been taken by surprise and is TERRIFIED she’s about to be killed to access the kind of laser focused calm needed to best her attacker? With a gun or similar that can be taken from her (because we’re dealing with close range here) and used against her?!\\nThirdly, even if women were able to do this and come out victorious, it comes with a cost. What you’re asking is for women to accept the possibility of becoming killers, because this is easier for you than accepting the need to address men’s violence.\\nAnd sure, you can say that it’s me or the other guy. But I don’t want to live in a world where killing people is an acceptable response to violence. I don’t want women or teachers or retail workers or anyone at risk of violence to have to become killers.\\nThese arguments have all been made before, but I haven’t really heard much about this last one. Because fourthly, if you want women to carry weapons to protect themselves against danger, do you realise that we perceive potential danger *all the time*?\\nHow do we know when it’s time to pull out the gun? When the guy’s staring creepily at us on the tram? When we think he’s slipped something in our drink? When he may or may not be following us home? When the car he’s driving has passed two times already, or when it becomes three?\\nThe majority of people who call for women to be armed in response to the *worst* violence they can imagine (rape and murder, because if she’s dead they know she wasn’t lying) don’t believe that men’s violence against women is a problem. They think ‘rape culture’ is a myth.\\nThey often believe that women lie, that men are demonised and that feminism has gone too far. The only time they’re willing to confront the reality of violence’s presence in women’s lives is when they can frame a victim in their mind as an ‘innocent angel, taken too soon’.\\nTrust me, they feel very differently about the girls and women who stumble out of hotel rooms and report being sexually assaulted by football players. They do not want to give guns to the girls their sons might rape after the prom.\\nSo we need to understand this call to arm women not just as ineffective public policy, but another shifting of the goalposts that keeps men in control of the narrative of men’s violence against women. Women should have guns - but only to kill the ‘real’ rapists, right?\\nI just want to reiterate this point again: significant numbers of people don’t believe women when we report violence perpetrated against us. Especially when the perps are ‘good boys from good families’.\\nEven if arming women to protect them from men’s violence DID work in the short term (as in, preserved her life over his), there is absolutely no way the people who take it upon themselves to decide who’s lying and who’s genuine would truly accept this.\\nAnd the full brunt of this public retribution would hit marginalised women and WOC the hardest. Cyntoia Brown spent almost two decades in prison after she killed her rapist with a gun - the same weapon people want to give to women to ‘protect’ themselves from rape.\\nIn Australia, those most significantly and brutally targeted by sexual violence are Aboriginal women. They’re already at the highest risk of incarceration. You think the right wing gun lobbyist zealots here are going to support them killing their (white) rapists?\\nAnd listen, I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t fantasised about carrying a flame thrower or a taser or even a gun around with me when confronted with yet another criminal, homicidal attack on a woman in this country. But I’m not a killer and I don’t want to become one.\\nShit, look at the FURY and OUTRAGE that I still get years after making the ‘kill all men’ joke. Can you imagine how these men would react if women actually started doing it? If women killed the men who were raping them, beating them, threatening them, following them?\\nThey would not abide.\\nThere’s really only one ethical, effective solution to counter men’s violence against women - and that’s to actually engage with the reality of it. Sexual homicides don’t arise out of the ether. They are rarer than most crimes against women, but they come out of the same bog.\\nTL;DR - We cannot end men’s violence against women by creating and advocating for more violence. No society should rally more enthusiastically around the idea of murder than they do education. Women shouldn’t have to kill in order to live. Fin.',\n",

Second, AI is getting ever smarter.\\nThese two trends overlap at the level of the algorithms that shape our digital content consumption.

While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective\\nSome of them have been used for a long time in advertising (e.g. positive/negative social reinforcement), but in a very weak, un-targeted form. From an information security perspective, you would call these \"vulnerabilities\": known exploits that can be used to take over a system.\\nIn the case of the human mind, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They’re in our DNA. They\\'re our psychology. On a personal level, we have no practical way to defend ourselves against them.\\nThe human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume.\\nImportantly, mass population control -- in particular political control -- arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don’t need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat.\\nSo, if mass population control is already possible today -- in theory -- why hasn’t the world ended yet? In short, I think it’s because we’re really bad at AI. But that may be about to change.

       " 'hilo 298': 'Okay, so real quick, I feel like I really need to explain intersectionality to white people because stuff like this, even though it\\'s well meaning is getting on my nerves. It\\'s really hard to see a black woman\\'s work be misused over and over again by progressives/well meaning ppl https://t.co/TFn3KwEX08\\nSo, Don Cheadle wearing a shirt that ways \"protect trans kids\" is amazing and I support the hell out of it, but it is not \"intersectionality\". That\\'s not what that means.\\nWithin, I\\'d say, mostly white political spaces, it\\'s very easy for people to confuse \"Intersectionality\" with \"inclusion\" or \"being considerate\" for other identities. It\\'s also easy to think it\\'s all about a combination of identities, but it\\'s not exactly that.\\nFirstly, I\\'ve made a really short and easy to understand video about this on my Youtube Channel. Check it out if you\\'d like to hear this explanation rather than read it. \\nhttps://t.co/NMnoyr3WK2\\nIntersectionality was a term coined by a black woman named Kimberle Crenshaw, (who by the way is still alive @sandylocks ), in 1989. It\\'s a term that she created in her paper she wrote for the Chicago Legal Forum. Full Text can be found here: https://t.co/rU9bAkvp5S\\nTo summarize what she meant when she defined intersectionality: It was about how black women were erased in conversations about discrimination because the feminist movement and the civil rights movement focused largely on its most privileged members.\\nSo feminism, at the time (and arguably still) focused largely on white women\\'s experiences with sexism and the civil rights movement focused, at the time (and arguably still) focused on how black men experienced racism. So black women\\'s experiences had to be measured against that\\nMeaning that in several legal cases, explained in the document and my video, if a black woman\\'s experiences with discrimination weren\\'t paralleled to how black men experience racism and white women experience sexism, their cases were dismissed or thrown out.\\nSo you had cases where black women would sue a company for racial discrimination and then you\\'d have the judge say that it was impossible for that to be true, because they currently employed black people. The problem was, the black people were all men.\\nAnd you\\'d have cases where they\\'d sue the company for being sexist, but they\\'d say that was impossible because they currently employed several women. The problem being, those women were all white.\\nAnd then you\\'d have cases where black women sued on behalf of themselves and black men for racial discrimination and their experiences were dismissed because their experiences as a woman, don\\'t negate their experiences as men. Black women were unable to represent their own.\\nSo the bones of intersectionality really has to do with the ways in which black women, specifically, have been ignored and dismissed because of the more mainstream view of what sexism and racism looks like.\\nSo, intersectionality is about viewing discrimination outside of the single axis view of discrimination where individuals are only impacted by singular forms of discrimination (white women by sexism, black men by racism).\\nIt\\'s an acknowledgement that sometimes these things intersect. That sometimes it\\'s racism and sexism, sometimes it\\'s just racism and sometimes it\\'s just sexism. But it\\'s about opening up to the idea that it isn\\'t just one of these things. It can frequently be more than one.\\nWhich is why people often think it\\'s about multiple identities, but really it\\'s about multiple types of discrimination that can frequently inform each other.\\nFor example, Women who are disabled are at a higher risk of sexual assault. When those women are black, that increases their risk of sexual assault. \\n\\nSo in that situation, you have people who have multiple identities, that face discriminations that often inform each other.\\nWhat Don Cheadle is doing here is called allyship. He is using his privilege as a cis man w/ access to an audience to spotlight transgender children. He is advocating for their protection and I think, within the scope of Hollywood, this is pretty radical and took a lot of guts.\\nI think he should be celebrated for it. But please do not call this \"intersectional\", because it isn\\'t. Him being a black man... and an adult isn\\'t really inching near what we\\'re discussing when we discuss intersectionality.\\nIntersectionality CAN look like a person outside of one group advocating for another, but the optics of this aren\\'t quite that. It\\'s allyship and I think that should be celebrated without misusing the work of a black woman and a scholar.\\nThe meaning and use of Intersectionality has expanded beyond black women\\'s experiences, but it will always be about understanding the ways in which multiple types of discrimination inform each other.\\nAs a black woman who is trans, and thus at a higher risk of violence, it\\'s important to me and my understanding of the world. \\nLet\\'s not warp it into a feel good thing about a mixture of identities. Let\\'s keep the definition and use consistent because it is important.',\n",

The Southwest loves making deities out of humans and the North is always there to help us demystify them. Thanks to Southwest media and intellectuals the hype goes on.\\nThe hype that has turned humans to deities did not start today in the Southwest, it started long ago when the word ‘risha’ a cushite/Semitic word was corrupted to Orisha and the meaning which was something saintly or divine was elevated to mean deity- funny!\\nI am sure many do not know that Sango was named Olufiran, and was the offspring of a marriage between a Northern princess and the Alaafin of Oyo at the time. We all just know about the deity status because that is what interests us, no research nothing, deify and worship.\\nAnd so it was till the times of Afonja, who became so headstrong and powerful to the point he believed, he challenge the authority of the Oba and aligned with Fulani warriors- Alimi and his men. Despite all warnings Afonja got carried away and lay all trust with the Fulani’s\\nAfonja would leave no stone unturned destroyed the unity of the yorubas and thought he had established his own kingdom, he was elevated by praise singers but little did he know those who helped him rise were planning his own downfall and no one would be around to help him\\nAfonja has weakened the hold of Oyo in the Southwest, so when the Fulani’s turned on him in ilorin, there was no saving grace for him, he had burned bridges for his own ego and personal pride and he suffered ultimately and his descendants would end up being serfs with his tenants\\nAfonja lost Ilorin to Alimi and his bandwagon of Fulani warriors. The story hasn’t been different in my own life time and experience. The Southwest has always produces tin-gods whose greed and ego will never let them do the right thing at the right time\\nMost yoruba people deify Awolowo and truth is, I don’t see him as being extraordinary, I see Awolowo, the same way I see modern politicians, opportunists who at best mask as saints with hypocrisy. The same Awolowo who stirred the waters that brought us into ethnic politics &amp; hate\\nAwolowo, who was the sole reason for the first coup, would turn around &amp; work against a region which was as progressive  as his and help starve millions of children to death under sanctuary of ‘all is fair and just in war’.  A man who said ‘we can’t feed our enemies’ to brothers\\nYes, the Igbos are our brothers and if Awolowo was anything near a nationalist, he should have watched his actions and words during the Biafra war. But no, he spoke all sorts and later wanted to be president of the same country he helped decimate a region in it\\nAnd later became bitter and cursed people because he never became president, how did Awo ever think he would be President? The problem with Southwesterners is that we play into the hands of the Fulani masters of the game and when used  and dumped we get bitter\\nThe case of MKO abiola was no different, he invested in media and was almost a demigod. There are allegations that he helped bring military govts to power and the same military government was the end of him. The same Abacha he helped bring to power made him suffer till he died\\nOne would have though present day politicians would learn from Awolowo, Abiola, all who had godlike fame and were reputed to dine with gods but as usual, they were dealt with by the master strategists of the Fulani oligarchy\\nSame thing is playing out now. Bola Tinubu is no different from Awolow and truth is, he may end up like him, bitter and vengeful. Like Afonja Tinubu has destroyed all the strongholds of the Yoruba in the southwest and all Yoruba institutions have been bastardized\\nWhilst the Fulani oligarchy ensure their structure is intact and keep working on a cohesive structure for the North, Tinubu has destroyed reference for Yoruba institutions.

He has reduced elder leadership to rubbles\\nThe different Yoruba socio-cultural groups has been destroyed by same individual, not even the Afenifere that brought Tinubu to power has been spared. Even the OPC has been reduced to a ghost of itself, all thanks to the tin-god in Bourdillon\\nLike Afonja, Tinubu is ready to burn all bridges for his Fulani friend. He is willing to sacrifice his own people as pawns all for his selfish ambition and shot at federal politics. The funny thing about this however is how Tinubu thinks the North will support him\\nHow Tinubu imagines that the North will allow a southwestern power house to take reins of this country amuses me.

       " 'hilo 301': 'This morning, I did something for the first* time in public: I offered Holy Mass ad orientem, that is, Christ the Head and Christ the Members together were physically oriented to the Father in sacrifice. Just the ten of us, with the communion of saints and angels.\\nMy predecessor at the parish had been writing about the practice in the parish bulletin for a few weeks prior to his transfer three Octobers ago. I think he was planning to celebrate ad orientem on occasion throughout Advent, maybe during the week.\\nWhen I arrived in 2016, I hadn’t given thought to reviving the posture, but I was glad he was planting the seed in people’s minds and hearts. As Jesus related in Friday’s Gospel, “the seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how“ (Mark 4:27). That’s how the Church works.\\nSince returning to Twitter, I started to encounter a refreshing species of Catholic: younger, intelligent, articulate, witty, and devout – “admirandum et imitandum” (to be admired and imitated). A few of the priests among them were promoting a movement they call the #Traddening.\\nThe Traddening, I would say, rebrands what Benedict XVI and others have advocated since Vatican II: a “reform of the reform” in Catholic spirituality, teaching, and morality by attending to elements of the sacred Liturgy that had remained always in theory, not often in practice.\\nIt’s about re-introducing disparate traditional elements, while allowing God thereby to generate an ethos of mystery that the current scenario seems to have obscured.\\nBishop Robert Barron frequently names that tune in six words: “Your life is not about you.” Those words run like a thread through all things Catholic, all things Christ—especially the Liturgy.\\nAt the root of Traddening is “tradition,“ from the Latin verb tradere, to hand over, to pass along. In his exposition of the central message of the faith, St. Paul declared, “I hand on to you what I myself received.” There’s no originality to Paul and his proclamation.\\nFor more detailed understanding of the Traddening, I commend you to such luminaries as Fr. Matt Fish of Washington and Archbishop Alexander Sample of Portland (OR). Priests here and there are implementing traditional liturgical measures, with appropriate instruction.\\nIt is no surprise to me that newer generations are responding more openly to the movement. I liken it to the experience of the Jews in last Sunday’s first reading from Nehemiah: newly hearing the Mosaic Law, suddenly, tearfully, they are moved – by what?\\nMoved by its beauty, goodness, and truth, its orientation to unity through distinction. The Law – or rather, the Lord Himself – seizes them, and they are overcome for not having heard it before, perhaps wondering how they could conform themselves to it.\\nNotice it’s not a series of ritual prescriptions, dietary or moral directives per se, but the quasi (?) liturgical revelation of them – the experience conveying the content.\\nToday’s feast of the Presentation of the Lord seemed providentially appropriate for my first* celebration of Mass where Christ is the head and members together faced the rising sun, although by the compass I think we were looking south.\\n*I’m lying: the very first time was a couple years ago in the company of nursing home residents. Some of them are still among us, while Others have fallen asleep. My instructions to them was brief but, I think, fitting. Nobody bat an eye or reported me.\\nThis morning I spoke of the light and life of the Infant King dawning on Simeon and Anna. While others would have been blinded by Him, they alone among the Temple occupants were wearing the proper glasses. They were properly oriented to Him.\\nHe was the Messiah promised who would, as Malachi said, purify and refine the sons of Levi (the priests among God’s people). “Pur” is Greek for fire. The light of revelation to the nations, the heat to burn away all that is not God.\\nMy personal takeaways, besides the Eucharist and Word in every validly celebrated Mass: gone is the sense of opposition, the pressure to perform. Head and Members together offering all prayers, work, joys, and sufferings to the eternal Father in the power of the Holy Spirit.\\nPlease God, my liturgical praxis for 15.5 years hasn’t been ill motivated or executed. Traddening principles and practices always appealed to me. I’ve been adopting them piecemeal and unobtrusively, as is suggested. They must become more than a fad or an affectation.\\nA la Ezra, Nehemiah, and the repatriated Jews, newly exposed to the Law and to a doxological worshipping attitude: “Where have You been all my life?” Such a mindset can translate to Liturgy and all the rest, unto its purification.\\nOngoing thanks to @clericalpod, which has provided information and motivation toward this priest’s ars celebrandi.\\nAll to the glory of God and the sanctification of the human race; all to the purification of ecclesial attitudes reductive of the priest to a kind of mascot instead of a Father and Shepherd.',\n",

Knowing scientific studies have pointed towards elevated levels of aluminum in children with autism, I began to research when this new ingredient was first added. https://t.co/ilQGoOUruR\\n3) The story of WHY it was added is fascinating, but WHEN it was added—1932—is important. Before that year, you will only find a rare mention of a few kids here &amp; there resembling the modern diagnosis of autism. https://t.co/8tesoP9k8Y\\n4) It was extremely rare before 1932—so rare that even the most prominent child psychiatrist in the country had never seen any children with it. In 1932, the decision was made to add aluminum to a vaccine because it seemed to make it work better. https://t.co/KBEFZeTrH2\\n5) Within a year or two, accounts of parents noticing aloneness in their children or obsession with repetitive patterns &amp; behaviors began to appear. https://t.co/e1mpfMfRvh\\n6) In Baltimore, a famous child psychiatrist named Leo Kanner began to see children—mostly boys—show up in his Baltimore clinic with a strange set of behaviors he had never even heard of before. https://t.co/jAcNQxTARP\\n7) In 1935, Kanner published a 500-page book on childhood psychiatry—the largest such book in the world.

It seemed unlikely that the one country in the world that made this change would begin to see autism within a year after having done so. https://t.co/EvG2RndvPy\\n10) I realized later the U.S wasn’t the only country to make this change. There was another, &amp; in fact, like the United States, they were struggling with a massive outbreak of diphtheria. https://t.co/S1AaJ4KcXE\\n11) This other country had begun to launch nationwide campaigns to have every child immunized—with the new aluminum-containing vaccine. https://t.co/wTdts7qRCd\\n12) The US was using a very nasty type of aluminum called potassium aluminum sulfate, sometimes called potash. Scientists in Denmark had experimented with something different—aluminum hydroxide &amp; noticed that this type of aluminum caused fewer granulomas, or nodules than potash. https://t.co/i58AylhKtB\\n13) In Austria, they noticed that aluminum hydroxide seemed to cause fewer problems so in their national campaign to immunize their children against diphtheria, they added aluminum hydroxide to their vaccines. https://t.co/0JivAYp08u\\n14) This would be the first time thousands of children would be injected with a metallic compound in recorded history. A few may have received mercury injections during experiments for congenital syphilis, but this was a nationwide campaign. https://t.co/YeI9yiODCY\\n15) If you don’t know the story, there was another child psychiatrist in Austria who began to see young patients show up at his clinic—their parents confused as to what had happened to their previously healthy children. https://t.co/1It9f6M5iI\\n16) Hans Asperger was at a loss to explain what was causing these children to experience strange neurological symptoms. He saw over 200 children—every one of them boys, &amp; they closely resembled the children Leo Kanner had seen in Baltimore. https://t.co/142V0NJuPt\\n17) It should strike anyone as remarkable that the two countries which launched nationwide diphtheria immunization campaigns in the 1930s using a new aluminum-containing shot were the very two countries where autism was first noticed &amp; documented. https://t.co/vBlIeodUZ4\\n18) Two countries began running nationwide immunization campaigns for their children, with a new vaccine that contained aluminum, &amp; within a year or so, those same two countries began to see the appearance of a new neurological disorder that would later be called autism. https://t.co/KwPFpa3JgC\\n19) The United States &amp; Austria—the two countries that used this new aluminum-containing vaccine in the 1930s, and the two countries where the case reports first describing autism appeared. Coincidence? You decide. https://t.co/QdQy2Baqcv\\n20) I tell the incredible story about the actual origins of autism—something I’ve never heard anyone else talk about—in a new book called “The Autism Vaccine.” It may be on Amazon by the time you read this, but it\\'s now available at:\\nhttps://t.co/AfxR8Sv5FU https://t.co/iZFEqSmhsn\\n21) \"The Autism Vaccine\" is now available on Amazon as well.

It represents an extraordinarily paranoid fever dream. 2/\\nBesides @brhodes and me, the enemies list memo floating around Trump\\'s NSC last year identifies other former Obama officials as well, including Jake Sullivan, @TVietor08, @nedprice, @jonfavs, @jonfiner, &amp; @danpfeiffer 👇. 3/ https://t.co/Xl7AcHY2S5\\nRecall that last year, a different wackadoodle NSC memo came to light alleging a vast conspiracy involving the deep state, media, political establishment, globalists, Marxists/Maoists, and Islamists to undermine Trump 👇. https://t.co/G89SFqKiTI 4/\\nHowever, this newly uncovered memo is much more specific &amp; potentially ominous in its implications, including a possible link to Black Cube. \\n\\nIt lists @brhodes as “likely the brain behind this operation.\"\\n\\nIt lists me as “likely ops chief”. \\n\\nAnd it also mentions Ben’s wife! 5/ https://t.co/IYgYrbyQMF\\nAround the time the memo was produced, Ben &amp; I were targeted in a dirty op by Black Cube, as were our wives (including an effort to get to my wife via my 6-year old daughter’s school). See this @RonanFarrow piece for details. https://t.co/sPp6n69LP4 6/\\nNotice too the “Echo Chamber” and “Iran Deal” frame of memo circulating at the NSC, as well as the emphasis on criticism of then-Trump adviser Seb Gorka. 7/ https://t.co/rJQQooFvub\\nWell, it turns out, the Black Cube opposition research on us obtained by the New Yorker emphasizes the same issues 👇. https://t.co/EWUzhJwKer 8/ https://t.co/Jzez9JkYvC\\nThe newly revealed memo seems to provide the most direct evidence yet of a possible link between Trump aides &amp; Black Cube’s operation to discredit proponents of the Iran Deal during the same timeframe, as first reported by the Guardian. https://t.co/QbY6XDXA4Y 9/\\nThere are also reasons to believe that the conspiracy theory on display in this new memo was widely embraced by ideologues at the White House, up to an including Trump himself, at the time of the Black Cube operation. 10/\\nIn Feb 2017, the Washington Free Beacon, citing “multiple sources in &amp; out of the White House,” blamed @brhodes &amp; a “small task force of former loyalists” for engineering Flynn’s resignation in an effort to eliminate an opponent of the Iran Deal. https://t.co/XDYev8zL0c 11/ https://t.co/qtqvfdL0BG\\nIn April 2017, Breitbart repeated the NSC memo’s frame, alleging the rebirth of the “echo chamber” to smear Trump officials like Seb Gorka (the only official cited by name in the NSC memo, which does so twice). https://t.co/0hwVPeh0AC 12/\\nOn May 16, 2017, Gorka told Sean Hannity that the entire “Resist Movement” inside and outside the government was being coordinated by the “Ben Rhodes/Colin Kahl Nexus.” Watch this starting around 01:43. https://t.co/cp4MC7r8Gd 13/\\nAlong the lines of the memo circulating at the NSC, a June 2017 article in the Free Beacon, citing unnamed senior administration officials, blamed @brhodes &amp; me for orchestrating a vast conspiracy against Trump. Read &amp; digest this insane paragraph 👇. https://t.co/sHc0CB5DrU 14/ https://t.co/agPaEm9sCh\\nAnd, according to FIRE &amp; FURY, “many in the White House believed” @brhodes “was the deep state” (p. 154) and Ben was “Trump’s favorite Obama plotter” (p. 215). 15/ https://t.co/TaUq5wZoXK\\nAll of this gives credence to the claim, made by a source familiar with Black Cube’s operation, that the operation to target me, @brhodes, &amp; our families was done “for Trump.” See @RichardEngel’s reporting here. https://t.co/NUeTkzNNiV 16/\\nFinally, separate and apart from any possible connection to the Black Cube operation, step back and think about what this memo circulating inside the Trump NSC last year represents. 17/\\nThe fact that a memo like this even exists is a scandal. The NSC\\'s role to staff the President &amp; coordinate the interagency on foreign policy—it is NOT the job of the NSC to map and target domestic political opponents or collude with outside allies to do so. 18/\\nScandalous revelations from the Trump White House are so common we become numb to them &amp; often so bananas that folks almost laugh them off. But this is no laughing matter. 19/\\nThe potential weaponization of the NSC to go after domestic opponents represents another dangerous shattering of democratic norms under Trump.\\n 20/\\nI know there is a lot of outrage fatigue and a dizzying volume and velocity of crazy news these days. But this newly uncovered memo is a BIG story and the implications are potentially very worrisome. 21/\\nCongress, the Department of Justice, and journalists must get their hands on the full memo (only 1 page has been made public) and investigate how this enemies list was used and whether the civil liberties of American citizens were violated in the process. 22/22',\n",
       " 'hilo 305': 'How did the conservatives, especially at National Review see the white south? When not writing paeans to southern traditionalism, they saw it as the basis of a coming conservative majority. A short thread: https://t.co/wOk6bhE8jv\\nSo, did the NR-style conservatives see southern segregationist Dems as conservatives or allies? Yes, I think they did.\\nWhich senators were receiving and subscribing to National Review? In 1960, 7 conservative Congressman and Senators subscribed to NR, two liberals, and two Southerners whose ACA ratings were lower due to party loyalty. https://t.co/hll4Jtz0BM\\nThe NR publisher, Bill Rusher saw the most conservative half of the House and Senate as the best audience for the magazine. This included almost all Republicans and “all of the best Democrats, notably the Southerners” incl Eastland, Stennis, Talmadge and Russell. https://t.co/d1yvfsd0aE\\nStrom Thurmond, in his Democratic days, didn\\'t want to miss an issue. https://t.co/vxHsWRFKcb\\nIn fact, in 1957 NR ran an interview with Richard Russell (D-Ga.) on why he opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. “All human history teaches us that problems of this nature must be solved by evolution and not by revolution,” he said, striking a consciously conservative tone.\\nConservative activists and ideologues harbored the dream of breaking free from Eastern liberal influence in the GOP by forging a Midwestern-Southern coalition, making formal the conservative alliance of the 1930s.\\nFor instance, this argument by conservative William Bradford Huie in the American Mercury in 1951. \"The Northern Democrats hate the South; they are all elected South-haters; while the Northern Republicans...have turned to Southerners as allies against the collectivist threat.\" https://t.co/kgr2BwZn4A\\nOr Isabel Patterson who argued in 1955 in National Review the New Deal \"Reconstruction\" of the North had broken the historic ties between the South and the Democratic Party. Conservative Democrats might ally with hypothetical dissident Republicans she suggested.\\nThis meant NR supported Southern Senators like Harry Byrd. But it also meant winning southern presidential votes (since the national Democratic Party tended liberal) and winning Southern Democratic voters to a newly lily-white Southern GOP.\\nNR\\'s \"chief ideologue,\" Frank Meyer saw Southern Democrats as a key part of the conservative coalition (first 2 photos). Bill Rusher (3rd photo) thought Goldwater running a suicidal campaign was worth it to make a bid for southern whites and therefore shift the GOP right. https://t.co/A490vGsPZR\\nPolitically, National Review\\'s favorite candidate Barry Goldwater, who \"hunted where the ducks were,\" was key to making the GOP attractive to southern whites. His anti-labor and, especially, his pro-states\\' rights views were most attractive alongside his strident anti-communism. https://t.co/wTfqgjv1y8\\nNational Review\\'s editor William F. Buckley asked his friend James J. Kilpatrick, an open segregationist, to report on Goldwater\\'s support in the South in 1963, stressing if \"in good conscience\" he could, non-racial issues. Kilpatrick did. https://t.co/t55BwjRa64\\nThe non-racist basis to Goldwater\\'s southern support is a myth that even contemporary conservatives like Buckley wanted to believe for their own sake. Here Bill Rusher describes southern white support for Goldwater. https://t.co/U3Qe7GHa6L\\nHis argument is quite familiar: it\\'s the Democrats with the racist history, it\\'s the backcountry southern Dems who are racist. Southern *Republicans* are constitutionalists and conservatives. They\\'re suburban and educated, not redneck racists.\\nThis was already conventional wisdom, that the Southern strategy was a legitimate vote-winning move and that the whites they were winning were not the real racists, as this memo by a Republican pol that Rusher drew from shows. https://t.co/ohrObRnvuo\\nIn part it\\'s by conflating upper south support for Ike in the 1950s with deep south support for Goldwater in 1964. But the language of class does a lot of work here: the middle class can\\'t be racist, just the poor. It\\'s an argument NR reversed when talking about liberal cities.\\nIt\\'s possible to find instances of people like William F. Buckley criticizing George Wallace. There\\'s a famous Firing Line episode. And, yes, conservative intellectuals were motivated by many more issues than simply racism.\\nBut as this thread shows and as I write here, the editors at NR were willfully naive about their own and their supporters racist attitudes and eager to interpret and whitewash segregationist voters and principled conservatives. https://t.co/9mFTLXqzr1.\\nLastly, I\\'ve seen a trend lately where people say \"x couldn\\'t be a conservative, they were a Democrat.\" Not only is this partisan blindness, but it totally flattens history, projecting back a modern understanding of partisan identity and right and left to the past.\\nJohn Eastland was not a progressive by any understanding of the word.  Conservatives insistence on interpreting left/right as about the size of government and assuming progressive/conservative maps easily onto this is a mistake, as I try and unravel here  https://t.co/UseCIrIRDC.\\nAnd where was Goldwater in all this? https://t.co/kTisz0vN9h',\n",
       " 'hilo 306': 'The @UN #InternationalYouthDay Was made memorable by credible ranking officers of the @PoliceNG from the AIG, SARS Commissioner, Technical Adviser to the IG, Force PRO, PPRO Zone2, SARS Commanders &amp; our host @koredebello, Speakers @zeal_a @yemusan1 #SafeSpaces4Youth #WhyEndSARS https://t.co/QBKVF5cYJX\\nThanking @knowyourright99 also for his delightful opening speech and @citizen_gavel @NelsonJide for making there despite the heavy schedule and travel time. What could we have done without the backing of @MAVINRECORDS and the great talents at #Caspertainment? Appreciate U Casper!\\nThe AIG said in his speech that not everyone is 100% healthy &amp; we can not say that based on that, we should End everyone’s life. In as much as this is true, we MUST appreciate that we can not treat the dead, neither can the sick approach a hospital renowned for killing patients.\\nTo intellectually understand the simplified campaign in its original construct as an idealistic movement, we must explore various studies (i.e. JonathanHaidt’s “Righteous Minds”), our moral sentiments are strongly related to feelings of empathy in the face of harm and unfairness.\\nThus, it is easier to mobilize against injustice than for Justice. This is typical in Nigeria. If we have started the campaign with #ReformPoliceNG nobody will take us seriously. The same way no one understood the meaning or essence of restructuring till tomorrow. It is vague.\\nWe have grown accustomed to enthusiastically fighting the bad (or perceived bad in most cases) for instance Police killings (EndSARS) instead of Police Reforms.\\nWe are more willing to fight Hunger &amp; Poverty instead of fighting for the kind of Growth &amp; Development that makes Food &amp; sustainable livelihoods plentiful. So when we focus so much about fighting the bad we lose sight of what constitute the Good &amp; how to unleash it. #WhyEndSARS\\nSometimes switching from the “bad” to the corresponding “good” is simply a matter of semantics: to fight against racism is to fight for nondiscrimination. So by  #EndSARS we’re inadvertently demanding the effective, immediate &amp; holistic PoliceReform, while ending the impunity.\\nSo we are in no way attacking the bad to create the good but simply doing good to force the bad to change. This was why we have refused to politicize the advocacy of weaponization se it against any Govt, political party or individual. We have also shunned shenanigans &amp; propaganda\\nOur focus was on setting a pace and creating a template that would sustainably cure other ailments in our respective institutions. The bad is often caused by the absence of the good. The good likewise refer to a Capable State, the ideal, which is not an utopian state of mind.\\nA bureaucracy that can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activity, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all. #WhyEndSARS\\nSo we have the attention of the authorities (Executive, Legislative and Judiciary) and most importantly the Police hierarchy and the dialogue has commenced. This is the second official dialogue as it coincides with the agreement on Security Sector Reforms at Interior @abellodam https://t.co/AhFULBYDtF\\nIt is the absence of a capable state that causes corruption (the inability to prevent public officials, often in collusion with other members of society, from subverting decision-making for private gain), as well as poverty and backwardness.\\nSome might argue that reducing corruption entails the creation of a capable state; the good is created out of the fight against the bad. But this is a fallacy.\\nTeachers and nurses often do not show up for work, but that does not mean that performance would improve much if they did. Policemen may stop asking for bribes, but that will not make them any better at catching criminals and preventing crime.\\nCurtailing side-payments does not imply the ability to manage concession contracts or collect taxes. Those that are in NASS believe a new Bill may be the answer but is it always about more legislation?\\nAside from prosecuting some bad apples, measures to fight corruption typically involve reforming procurement rules, public financial management systems, and anti-corruption legislation. The underlying assumption is that the new rules, unlike the previous rules, will be enforced.\\nThat has not been Uganda’s experience. In 2009, under pressure from the aid community, the government enacted what was billed at the time as the best anti-corruption legislation in the world; and yet all corruption indicators have continued to worsen.\\nUganda is not an exception, same is happening in Nigeria since 2015 change of Government, with an anti corruption themed political party.\\nSo this is just to paint a picture of the multilayered and dynamic angles through which we need to channel our energies to ensure we are not fixated in the approach to building our nation. It will require a lot of inputs from the public and not just those in the system.\\nThe next Police Recruitment will be monitored surgically. We need enlightened hands and good heads on the right shoulders forthwith. No more political recommendations and back door hires. Nigeria belongs to all of us. #WhyEndSARS #LetsKeepTalking\\nWe are now focusing our energy on #ReformPoliceNG (Doing the Good...shining our Light instead of fighting the bad. We now have the attention of each and every entity that matters. It is time to build &amp; not further tear down). @citizen_gavel https://t.co/4Cw9QmBZzQ',\n",

A huge number of people under 20 can\\'t read face clocks, having grown up with only digital one.\\n2. Many people don\\'t know how to spell \"library.\" It\\'s in our email address. This causes problems\\n3. A disturbing number of young people don\\'t actually know how book-lending at the library works. They assume it costs money! Teach your children about libraries!\\n4. Crime and thriller are basically the same thing in many cases. In fact, we have doubles of books because of that.\\n5. People use hidden codes like asterisks to mark which books they\\'ve read. Please don\\'t do that! The system will let you know if you\\'ve already borrowed something! Just ask.\\n6. If an automatic door breaks, people will walk into it instead of reading the sign at face height.\\n7. Libraries are a godsend for blind and deaf people and not just for audiobooks. They can come for help with filling out forms and getting directions.\\n8. Some elderly people go through books at a TERRIFYING rate. They are to be feared and respected.\\n9. Some people are so afraid of computers that they will come to you with a query and then become upset if you offer to look it up on the computer instead of in a book.\\n10. Some people have never, ever used a telephone. Especially older women. Their husband did it for them.\\n11. The DWP fuck over everyone but especially the most vulnerable and I haven\\'t met a single library worker who hasn\\'t helped struggling library users with food or phone calls or even a cup of tea when it\\'s cold and they can\\'t afford heating.\\n12. The Jobcentre regularly lie to people and like to tell them they can get services at libraries that simply do not exist. We will try our very best to help you get what you should have been given at the Jobcentre.\\n13. Most banks assume that everyone has an email now. In fact, some people have trouble proving that they exist at all without one.\\n14. Library folk are good folk. We do this because we are passionate about it. We have to be.\\n15. Libraries aren\\'t quiet anymore. They\\'re community hubs now. They may have quiet study areas but most libraries are bustling with activity. Between kids\\' classes, singing and memory groups for those with Dementia, craft sessions and noisy office equipment, don\\'t expect silence\\n16. Libraries remain the only place where you can spend hours in a publicly-accessible building without being expected to spend money. Parents come to entertain their children for free on wet days. People in poverty come for a warm place to sit. Libraries are a haven.\\n17. Some people will go their entire lives only reading 2-3 authors but still have enough material to read a book every month. (See also: Danielle Steel, James Patterson, Clive Cussler, etc.)\\n18. A library lives and dies by the staff on the counter. You can have the best funding, all of the books and tech in the world but you\\'ll only get footfall if your staff go above and beyond. Sometimes even that doesn\\'t work, though and it\\'s frustrating.\\n19. We\\'re funded based on footfall. I\\'ve seen staff cry because we lost a youth group to a private hall that has fancier facilities like a cafe. We need all the footfall we can get.\\n20. Staff are hitting their heads against walls volunteering to create events, classes and groups only to have them shot down because local councils don\\'t understand social media or want to charge for it. I can\\'t overemphasise just how much unpaid work staff do.\\n21. Most of the facilities are only working because staff pay out of pocket to get things working. My manager bought a new laminator when we couldn\\'t afford one. She buys in colouring materials for kids. We sometimes bring in our own stationery. We even but lightbulbs in.\\n22. Authors don\\'t like to visit little libraries because they don\\'t get paid. Bookstores often pay.\\n23. The \"sexy librarian\" trope has actually done a LOT of harm and has caused countless incidences of sexual assault by men who can\\'t tell the difference between porn and reality.\\n24. Old ladies keep libraries in business. Old ladies who read are the best. Old ladies who can tell you exactly which page features the most gruesome murder scene are the very best.\\n25. Library staff ALWAYS want to know what you thought of the book. We want to know what to recommend to others!\\n26. I\\'m not supposed to have favourite library users but I do: I love library couples, who bicker over each others\\' reading tastes or share books and then argue about the themes.\\nI also love the autistic kids with special interests. I will crawl over hot coals to get you a book about the specific type of train you are interested in, tiny child. I will listen to you tell me about it in great detail.

I don't have the capacity to also go to #BlackHat2018 and #BSidesLV so will sadly be missing those :(\\nWith that said though, @BSidesLV is one of my favs and I've never been to Black hat.

Even missed family reunions to go!\\n1 What is there to do at defcon?\\nWhile most of my time is dedicated to our hak5 booth in the vendor hall, there are also talks, villages, parties, contests, meetups, etc.\\nThere's a get together for anything and everything: LGBTQ, furries, women, kids,  zip codes, etc.\\nMost of these can be found via the defcon website. I highly recommend taking some time to look at the schedule of events and picking a few each day. Leave yourself time to relax and recoup from the non-stop house music, loud casino machines, people, and smoke.\\nPersonally, I like to spend my free time making new friends, meeting other women in the industry, checking out the lock picking and wifi villages and wandering.

Bring spare batteries for your shinies! https://t.co/RMHWxkyWSx\\nNow let's talk safety and security at #defcon #BlackHat2018 #BSidesLV !\\nI have a background in hospitality administration.\\nSome things the hotels / restaurants should know, but may not have been trained correctly on:\\n-when you check into your hotel, the front desk should give you a room key and WRITE DOWN your room #. They should NOT say your room number out loud. If they do, ask them to give you a new room and not say it out loud. This is in case of eavesdropping.\\n-do not leave valuables in your room. Bring a comfortable carry all bag to walk around the con with. You'll thank me when you buy something in the vendor hall and they don't have shopping bags.. (Hak5 does offer shopping bags this year!)\\n-check and double check your hotel and restaurant bills. It's really easy for someone to charge something to your room or table, especially if they know your name. Much worse if they know your room #. It's also easy for a restaurant or hotel to double charge.\\nCasinos have rules for a reason, please follow them, especially in light of the tragedy at Mandalay Bay.\\n-masks on the casino floor are not permitted.\\n-underage drinking is not permitted\\n-weapoms are not permitted\\nEtc etc. Don't give the hotel/casino reason to have bias.\\nPersonal safety:\\nBe aware of the people around you. The only time I have been victimized at a con was in the presence of someone I thought was a good aquaintance. If you don't feel safe, report, gather evidence, do whatever you need to do to feel safe. Read the code of conduct.\\nAwareness: when unlocking your phone, hide your pin/phrase/gesture, whatever. Always keep your phone on your person. Not just from badies at the con, but for theft as well.\\nHave a buddy system so y'all stick together 24/7. Have a code word or something that tells your friend that you feel unsafe and wanna leave. This is the same thing women do at clubs!\\nAnd ladies, if you're in an awkward situation and want to leave without being harassed or followed, I'll gladly be your bff that just happened to be there at the right moment and omg we need to catch up right now because I have something important to tell you.\\nNever accept open beverages. It's not rude. It's mandatory.\\nBe aware of your surroundings when heading back to your room at the end of the night.\\nUse that buddy system.\\nHere's a recent post from @thedarktangent re the code of conduct:  https://t.co/xkJoJ4LDnK\\nRemember, cons are what you make of them. If you go in positively, positivity comes back to you. I truly believe this! I have been going to defcon for 10 years for a reason. I've met friends who I later invited to my wedding.

       " 'hilo 309': 'THREAD: What does today\\'s news that Manafort\\'s attorneys briefed Trump\\'s attorneys about what he told Mueller after he agreed to cooperate tell us?\\n1/ Today @nytimes reported that Manafort\\'s lawyer repeatedly briefed Trump\\'s lawyers about Manafort\\'s discussions with Mueller *after* Manafort had already begun to cooperate. This arrangement is extremely unusual and highly questionable. https://t.co/tA5ohrGTtI\\n2/ Before a defendant pleads guilty, his interests typically align with other people who are under investigation. In this investigation, before Manafort pleaded guilty, his interests were roughly aligned with Trump\\'s because both of them are under investigation.\\n3/ Once Manafort pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, his interests shifted. Typically cooperators / flippers are viewed as part of the prosecution team. They are trying to help the prosecution by providing information and potential testimony.\\n4/ It is common for attorneys representing subjects of an investigation to enter into what is called a \"joint defense agreement.\" That is a way that lawyers for different people under investigation agree to exchange information and keep that information privileged.\\n5/ That agreement works because of something called the \"common interest\" doctrine, which says that when two people have a common interest in a legal matter, they can exchange information about that matter and keep it privileged.\\n6/ Those agreements are routine in complex white collar criminal cases, and I often enter into those agreements with other attorneys when I represent people under investigation. (And when I was a federal prosecutor, white collar defense attorneys usually had those agreements.)\\n7/ A common provision of those agreements, whether they\\'re written or not, is that the person is required to notify everyone else that is part of the agreement if their client agrees to cooperate with the government, because that ends the common interest.\\n8/ Once someone flips, as Manafort did, his interests are against everyone else under investigation because the prosecutors will require him to cooperate against everyone else and tell them everything he knows. So communications from other subjects to him aren\\'t privileged.\\n9/ In this case, after Manafort flipped, Mueller\\'s team rightfully believed that their conversations with him wouldn\\'t be shared with other people under investigation. Manafort\\'s decision to do so was highly deceptive and undermined Mueller\\'s investigation.\\n10/ By reporting to Trump what Mueller was asking about, Manafort was hurting Mueller, not helping him--even though he agreed to assist Mueller under the agreement. By any standard, what Manafort and his attorney did was deceptive and highly improper.\\n11/ Earlier today during our recording of the #OnTopic podcast, @JoyceWhiteVance said she would view communications with Trump\\'s team as a breach of the agreement. (The episode will be out tomorrow--Wednesday.) I agree. But as I told her, I would go further if I was Mueller.\\n12/ Because Manafort had agreed to cooperate with Mueller, his attorney\\'s communications with Trump\\'s team were no longer privileged because they do not share a common interest. Mueller should seek to discover the communications between Manafort\\'s attorney and Trump\\'s attorneys.\\n13/ That would be very tricky to do, because those attorneys would resist, and putting them in this situation could disqualify them from representing their clients because they may have disclosed client confidences, which means their clients might have a claim against them.\\n14/ The mere threat of taking this action would usually dissuade any lawyer from continuing to engage in this activity. But it\\'s already happened. So what can be done now? While the attorneys did something highly unusual and likely unethical, it\\'s generally not a crime.\\n15/ On its own, this could just be considered highly questionable judgment. But if this is part of a pattern of activity, you could imagine this being part of a larger obstruction of justice case being made by Mueller. It is another active attempt to undermine his investigation.\\n16/ I have participated in many investigations, both when I was a federal prosecutor and now as a defense attorney, and I\\'ve never heard of something like this happening. If true, Trump\\'s attorneys are willing to take huge risks because they think they can get away with it.\\n17/ Some of you are asking, in responses to this thread, how they can get away with doing this. For one thing, it\\'s very possible that none of them wrote down the conversations they had with each other, and all of them would resist efforts to discover what they told each other.\\n18/ If Mueller pursued them, it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt exactly what they said. Trump and his allies could bring political pressure and call Mueller\\'s tactics aggressive, which they would be--they would be a response to highly aggressive tactics.\\n19/ Trump could always pardon his attorneys, although that could come at a political cost. So what comes of this? Mueller\\'s team could detail all of this to the judge who will sentence Manafort. She is obligated to consider the \"history and characteristics\" of Manafort.\\n20/ She is also obligated to consider the \"nature and circumstances\" of his offense. Mueller could also try to find out what the attorneys told each other--merely trying to do that would have consequences. He could also include this activity as part of this obstruction case.\\n21/ Given DOJ guidance that a sitting president can\\'t be indicted, any conclusion that Trump obstructed justice would likely not take the form of an indictment. But the efforts to obstruct the investigation via Manafort could be part of Mueller\\'s conclusion on the topic. /end',\n",

It\\'s a rare day that a tweet like this doesn\\'t show up on my TL. This one showed up this morning.\\nDifferent animals, different places, all one story: save the endangered &lt;focus victim&gt;.\\n3. There are a few species which are endangered specifically by increasing temperatures, but only a few. The polar bear is one charismatic example.\\nThe Florida panther\\'s threat is not temperature related. It\\'s plain ol\\' habitat destruction, the always and forever big one.\\n4. We know a few things about extinction. For one thing, we know it\\'s a one way trip. They don\\'t come back.\\nFor another thing, we know that it is currently running at about 1000 x the historic rate. For every one species we would have lost in a functioning ecosystem, we lose 1000\\n4. The way life works is, for every possible place to live and source of food, at least one creature will evolve to live in that place and eat that food from that source.\\nWe call that a \"niche.\"\\nWhen the last weed patch of one certain type is paved over, some species goes extinct\\n5. Certain special, large, glorious animals become extinct because humans patiently, steadily, kill every last one. That\\'s what happened to the Passenger Pigeon, which used to darken the skies for hours at a time.\\nImagine watching a flock of birds that blocked the sun,\\n6. Flying overhead for an hour, blocking the sun the whole time.\\nImagine the life our fathers saw, and took from us.\\nNow imagine all the life we see, that we are taking from our children and all other humans forever and ever Amen.\\n7. There are many people today who strongly believe that it is morally wrong to kill an animal and eat it.\\n8. I have literally never heard one single person take the stand that it is morally wrong to drive the cars that kill millions upon millions of animals and leave their rotting corpses dotted up and down the highways and byways.\\n\"I like my car.\"\\n\"Cars are useful.\"\\n\"We have to...\"\\n9. If you\\'re old, like I am, you may remember when a road trip on a summer night would leave your windshield nearly opaque with the corpses of bugs.\\nIt doesn\\'t happen like that any more.\\nEven the bugs are dying off.\\nThey are the foundation of the food chain.\\n10. Everything either eats bugs, or eats things that eat bugs, or eats things that bugs pollinate.\\nI\\'m not saying that sweeping billions upon billions of bugs out of the air, smashed on millions upon millions of windshields, made them die off. We invented poisons just for that.\\n11. But all those billions of smashed bug windshield paint were abruptly, like never before in all of time, extracted from the ecosystem, their ecological purpose unfulfilled. Their bodies didn\\'t even fall to the ground to be eaten.\\nNothing exists alone. There is only one whole.\\n11. I was in a conversation with some friends the other day about the usefulness of possums. Possums eat ticks.\\nPossums are probably the number one spring roadkill species. They\\'re slow. When frightened they stop.\\n❌\\n12. We talk quite a bit about global warming, the process by which thermal energy is continually captured by carbon compounds in the atmosphere, particularly CO² and methane. Many people - all the good ones - are concerned, and worry about adding more carbon.\\n13. There are numerous discussions and plans for reducing the emissions of industrial carbon in the atmosphere.\\nNo real action, you understand. Emissions go up every year, especially in the US and China, but... Talk. Chin music.\\nIt\\'s the first step.\\n14. Are you one of the people who retweets pleas to save the Florida Panther, or the Keys Deer, or the Red Wolf, or the Orangutan?\\nCutting carbon emissions is guaranteed to not help.\\nWeeping for the creature is guaranteed to not help.\\n15. Almost for sure, solar panel farms and wind power farms are guaranteed to make it worse. Whole chunks of ecosystem will be modified to suit the needs of solar panels and wind turbines, and whatever lived in the unmodified ecosystem will, by definition, not live in the new one\\n16. Building enough lithium batteries to power a fleet of cars and trucks to replace the current fossil fueled fleet will destroy whole new ecosystems that have so far survived petroleum extraction and refining, survived the paving over of millions of acres of once living soil.\\n17. Either we care about the rest of life or we don\\'t.\\nEither we need a certain minimum of other life to maintain an Earth that can support us or we don\\'t.\\nBut pretending that worrying about \"global warming\" and \"carbon\" will reduce or alleviate the extinction event we have made\\n18. is, at the very most generous, not realistic.\\nThe day there are no more road-killed possums in Missouri will be the day there are no more possums in Missouri.\\nAnd since we starved all the songbirds that used to eat the ticks, when we killed off all the bugs they also ate,\\n19 and the ticks are getting nature\\'s revenge on oh-so-clever humanity, maybe we oughta keep the possums, at least.\\nOur industrial lives are killing our only planet. And it\\'s not \"where we live,\" it\\'s our bodies too. Ourselves. \\nAnd it\\'s making us crazy.\\n20. I am asking the world to me and think the unthinkable.\\nPark all the cars.\\nPark all the planes.\\nCreate a society we can walk to.\\nPrior to 200 years ago it\\'s the only kind there had ever been.

There has been much reporting, mainstream and otherwise, about Dennis. I have also covered his story in detail on my channel for the past several years.\\nHe first went public via a real estate tycoon named Tim Blixeth. The conversation that he had with Sheriff Joe Arpaio was recorded and then originally released through soundcloud by \"The American Report\". Link to their uploads: https://t.co/D6KN29HuQr\\nPlease listen to the audio above and also please listen to these videos that I have done on Dennis Montgomery: https://t.co/PH7AcfU6xM and https://t.co/NuR2GG5jlq\\nMontgomery tells a story of completely rogue intelligence agencies spying on every American under the guise of security. Montgomery says he was instructed directly by Brennan and Clapper to penetrate and spy on private corporations and American citizens (cont)\\n(cont) even replacing voter information in Florida. It was also revealed via Montgomery that President Trump (along with MANY others) were being illegally spied upon as far back as 2012 and earlier. There has been MUCH written about him, both positive and negative (cont)\\n(cont) in the years since he has come forward. Dennis Montgomery filed DOZENS of whistleblower complaints over the years, and NONE of them were acknowledged. He says he just wanted to get the information about the illegality out so that something could be done about it.\\nHe was ignored by Obama. Many have attacked his credibility and written hit pieces on him. You can find the NY Times doing that here: https://t.co/5kZBNqghG7 I will leave it up to you to do some more due diligence on Mr. Montgomery and come to your own conclusions.\\nWhat can not be ignored is that he was, in fact, in the positions he claimed he was in. And this was more clear when in December of 2015 he met with the FBI under an immunity agreement, and handed over all of the information he had that proved his claims to the FBI and Jim Comey\\nHe met specifically with James Baker, and he was actually questioned about this when Baker went in front of the House committee. Please see Meadows questions: (bulk of information of page 100) )https://t.co/FofZt8getr https://t.co/xzf9xRy0KY\\nMotgomery has alleged publicly, via his former attorney Larry Klayman, that the CIA and Brennan and Clapper were electronically spying on Supreme Court judges, and even FISA court judges and members of congress.\\nThis shouldn\\'t come as a surprise to you, as this has been admitted. https://t.co/eHqYjfSL7g\\nSo, after all of this, imagine my surprise when several months ago I received an email from Dennis Montgomery, who I had been covering for years. I made the rules very clear- do not send me ANY information that is classified or holds any classification whatsoever,\\nHe has been sending me links to articles, and some stories of some of the things he was tasked with doing while a contractor with the CIA. Sarah Carter and John Solomon briefly covered his story and then it sort of just fizzled away. They appeared on Hannity to talk about it\\nhttps://t.co/3v2RncLRX6\\nAs an open source journalist, I don\\'t work with sources. When I get correspondence, I usually respectfully decline, and forward the source along to other reporters I trust. I did that with Dennis, but he continued to email me. I kept reading.\\nTonight, he sent me a story that I really wanted to share with everyone. I am just going to throw it up here. I can not confirm it with open source data, and he did not share any hard proof with me. I want to be open and transparent about that.\\nI can only say this- the Obama administration CERTAINLY was not scandal free. And for all of the outrage the media directs at President Trump for calling the Fake News the enemy of the people? What I am about to share with you was directed at the media FROM the Obama admin.\\nHere are two print screens of an email I received that I am sharing unedited other than to redact email addresses. This email is from Dennis Montgomery, the man who designed \"The Hammer\". I got permission from him to share this with all of you: https://t.co/VoShYpNxOm\\nFor those who didn\\'t read that, Montgomery sent me an email that said \"We breached the NYT network servers in FBI/CIA/NSA domestic surveillance programs I worked in more than once collecting information on their management and employees including reporters...\" (cont)\\n...\"I produced reporters notes and rough drafts ofthe reporters work prior to them releasing their main story to the FBI as part of my immunity agreement. This information was verified by the FBI. The FBI confirmed the data I produced on August 2015, and I testified..\"(cont)\\n(cont) \"to this during my December 2015 meeting with the DOJ and FBI when I was under oath during my video taped interview at the DC FBI headquarters, which I received immunity for\"...\\nAgain, this is coming straight from Dennis Montgomery, but I felt it important enough to share with all of you. I am an open source journalist. This is the very first time I am reporting on source information. Note how I am providing you with the sources full name and info.\\nThere has been much said about the credibility of Dennis Montgomery. To date no one has proven him to be lying about anything he has alleged. I wanted to be transparent here, and I have been. But, IMO? This is a pretty terrifying admission about what our IC is doing to Americans',\n",

So Justin Trudeau\\'s own principal secretary, and the chiefs of staff to the energy and environment ministers, were all on the payroll of the same US anti-oil lobby group that just sunk the Trans Mountain pipeline.\\n\\nThis is a great victory that they have worked for, for years.\\n8. Here\\'s Gerald Butts, Trudeau\\'s chaperone, mentor and strategist, a few years back saying he is against all oil pipelines. Not because of any particular route. He just opposes oil pipelines, and the entire oil economy: https://t.co/DNrYPOes7C\\n9. It wasn\\'t just the Tides Foundation. Dozens of U.S. and European foundations poured money into Canada to attack our oilsands and pipelines. Here\\'s the 2008 campaign plan by the New York-based @RockBrosFund. Look at their Canadian front groups: https://t.co/Sq2GDO4Hbm https://t.co/HoghCciceT\\n10. Leaf through that document, verified by @Pembina as authentic. Gerald Butts, Marlo Raynolds, Zoe Caron -- Trudeau\\'s senior staff -- were on the @RockBrosFund payroll with the mission of destroying Canadian oil. Do you think they stopped their crusade when they came to power?\\n11. When I ran https://t.co/rnRunfG26N, we filed complaints with @CanRevAgency about this illegal conduct -- breaking the Income Tax Act. All of Trudeau\\'s crooked allies were audited, and several were on the verge of losing their tax status: https://t.co/d1G76jvR4a\\n12. It was patently obvious Trudeau\\'s friends were cheating the system. Read one of our meticulously researched complaints for yourself here: https://t.co/BtMV5uKMUB\\n13. When Trudeau took over, he installed people from these law-breaking organizations into his highest offices. Then he ordered the professional, civil servants, the non-partisan auditors at @CanRevAgency, to stop enforcing the law against his friends: https://t.co/WUowPgTn7j\\n14. Are you shocked that I would use words like \"cheat\" and \"corrupt\"? Don\\'t be. Trudeau is the first sitting prime minister to be convicted of breaking the law. He illegally took a free, $100,000+ gift, and then tried to cover it up. https://t.co/lIKWbuees2\\n15. I forgot to point out perhaps the nuttiest part of the ruling: block the pipeline, because there are some killer whales in the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. See paragraph 68: https://t.co/edxZMIRm7v https://t.co/rY1NDlAxym\\n16. According to the Port of Vancouver, 3,160 ships come and go each year, an that\\'s climbing steadily. They\\'re not a problem, apparently. But ONE MORE SHIP PER DAY -- which is what the pipeline would add -- is an ecological crisis. Port stats: https://t.co/wyXgNNZuff\\n17. Why are thousands of leaky, rusty Chinese ships carrying their imports to Vancouver considered whale friendly; but state of the art, double-hulled tankers are not? Well, because Trudeau\\'s lobbyists don\\'t care about Chinese ships or OPEC oil -- they only lobby against Canada.\\n18. But look at that wording again: the pipeline is being blocked because of the threat to \"Aboriginal culture uses\" of killer whales. What does that mean? What is a \"cultural use\" of a killer whale, that only Aboriginal people can do? They can\\'t hunt them. It\\'s made up. https://t.co/DL9sosgvhe\\n19. So these three extremist judges say 3,160 Chinese freighters are fine, but one Canadian oil tanker a day is a threat; they say Aboriginals, including those hundreds of miles inland, have special \"cultural uses\" for whales. They\\'re very concerned. But what about B.C.\\'s sewage?\\n20. Like the super-gross city of Montreal, Victoria dumps its raw sewage into the ocean. Where those precious killer whales are. Every day, Victoria treats the sea like a garbage dump. But that\\'s OK, you see. That doesn\\'t interfere with \"cultural use\": https://t.co/u5dxGTsow1\\n21. Last point: well over $100,000,000 has flooded in to Canadian politics from foreign anti-oil lobbyists, including into the 2015 election, through \"third party\" campaign groups. Some even registered with @ElectionsCan_E with their US mailing addresses! https://t.co/E9oPOzfpTj\\n22. Most of it has gone to the NGOs that @gmbutts coordinated. And: total silence from the Media Party. Not one word. Compare that to the freak-out that CBC had when the NRA merely looked at Canada -- didn\\'t spend a dime, just looked: https://t.co/927FjfUvK0\\n23. Whenever Harper or a Conservative would meet a Republican, it was front page news, \"US-style politics!\" Whenever Trudeau or Butts would meet a Democrat -- or even have senior Democrats running and funding their campaign -- it was just called impressive and worldly by the CBC.',\n",

       " 'hilo 317': 'Long before #MeToo became the catalyst for a women\\'s movement about sexual assault — and a decade before the fall of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and U.S. Olympic gymnastic doctor Larry Nassar — there was Jeffrey Edward Epstein. \\n\\n#PerversionofJustice https://t.co/z3rIvzQWE9\\nMultimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein was accused of sexually assaulting dozens of teen girls. Their stories were dismissed by prosecutors, who cut Epstein a lenient deal. His victims have never had a voice, until now.\\n\\nPart 1 of #PerversionofJustice: https://t.co/Rdg8AkvaDO\\n\"I don\\'t think anyone has been told the truth about what Jeffrey Epstein did,\" said Michelle Licata, now 30. \"He ruined my life and a lot of girls\\' lives. People need to know what he did and why he wasn\\'t prosecuted so it never happens again.\" https://t.co/RCWvKdqYGX\\nWhat he did, according to interviews with victims and police, was lure girls, aged 13 to 16, to his mansion for a \"massage.\" He would molest them, paying extra for oral sex and intercourse, and offering more money to bring him new girls, like an underage sex pyramid scheme. https://t.co/cVAjM5zGDn\\nThe evidence police collected to support the victims\\' stories was impressive. \"We had victims who didn\\'t know each other, never met each other and they all basically told the same story.\"\\nEpstein could have spent life in prison, but he only served a little more than a year in jail. Why? A secret deal was struck — an extraordinary plea arrangement — with help from future Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta. https://t.co/OFzvjGZJm0\\nDocuments show Acosta, then a federal prosecutor, didn\\'t just buckle under pressure from Epstein\\'s lawyers; he and other prosecutors worked *with* them to contain the case — even as the FBI was uncovering evidence of a wider sex trafficking operation.\\nThe secretive deal allowed Epstein to quietly plead guilty to two felony prostitution charges. He admitted to committing only one offense against one underage girl, who was labeled a prostitute, even though she was just 14.\\n\"She was was taken advantage of twice — first by Epstein, and then by the criminal justice system that labeled a 14-year-old girl as a prostitute,\" said the girl\\'s lawyer.\\nThe pact Epstein negotiated with federal prosecutors was sealed so that no one — not even his victims — could know the full scope of his crimes. Court records, letters and emails show that the deal was negotiated, signed and executed behind victims\\' backs.\\nTwo police officers were willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein. They said they felt pressured by the state attorney to drop the investigation and downgrade it to a misdemeanor. https://t.co/u5nd8mTabV\\nBut they continued their work, finding evidence that supported the girls\\' allegations: Phone calls and messages like, \"Tanya can\\'t come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice,\" and naked photographs of girls in Epstein\\'s closet. https://t.co/AtE7BY9lHE\\n\"I always hoped that the plea would be thrown out and that these teenage girls, who were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, would get to finally shed that label and see him go to prison where he belongs,\" said one detective.\\nThat detective died in May.\\n\\n#PerversionofJustice Part 2: https://t.co/x8K1CTnypW\\nOn the morning of his sentencing, none of Epstein\\'s victims were in the courtroom — and that was by design. The victims couldn\\'t voice their objections or possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the plea agreement altogether.\\nOne victim, Courtney Wild, who was 14 when she met Epstein, is suing the federal government, alleging that prosecutors kept victims in the dark as part of a conspiracy to give Epstein one of the most lenient deals for a serial child sex abuser in history. https://t.co/p9odz1Jm0K\\nOnce behind bars, #JeffreyEpstein didn\\'t go to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida. He didn’t even spend much time in his cell.\\nHe was allowed to leave for work release six days a week. His year of \"house arrest\" included trips to New York and the Virgin Islands. \\n\\nPart 3 of #PerversionofJustice: https://t.co/lsynvA1rPr\\nToday, ongoing litigation could reveal more about #JeffreyEpstein\\'s crimes and who was involved. A lawsuit is set for trial Dec. 4 in Palm Beach County.\\nAs with every case involving Epstein, this one could further embarrass his once-impressive roster of A-list friends and associations, which included Bill Clinton, President Trump and Prince Andrew.\\n\\nA guide to Epstein\\'s inner circle: https://t.co/E8dgNLZcy5\\nSeveral women who went to Epstein\\'s home as underage girls are scheduled to testify against him for the first time. \\n\\n\"These guys will get it in the end because us girls are not gonna sit here and just let this keep happening.\" https://t.co/EeRNSOPblx\\n.@jkbjournalist analyzed thousands of court records, lawsuits, witness depositions and FBI documents, filing motions in federal court and submitting FOIA requests.

       " 'hilo 322': \"Thread \\n180 years of excuses. Jews get murdered and always they make exuses. Just this week @BBCTwo get told by an Arab the Jews are the target &amp; #BBC covers it up. Elsewhere @RashidaTlaib distorts history. All to hide the real cause of the conflict - Arab violence against Jews.\\nDuring the Second Intifada - media &amp; politicians were adamant total desperation was the reason Arab terrorists killed Jews in suicide attacks. Yet the 2 bombers at Mike's Place were British , how were they more desperate that you or I? Let us look closer at these excuses- https://t.co/BRVdr1Pbzd\\n2019 &amp; Israeli civilians are murdered as 100s of rockets are fired at Israel. This as violent riots on Gaza's border are painted as peaceful by the media. The excuse? Gaza is a pressure cooker. Logically, if you remove the pressure the killing stops. So let's check that shall we? https://t.co/4TEjd4qH9w\\nIt is February 7 2019. Ori Ansbacher is raped &amp; murdered. Full details of the brutal killing are withheld. The terrorist explicitly said he entered Israel with a knife to kill a Jew. The BBC didn't make up excuses - or mistranslate - they didn't even bother to report it. https://t.co/gNbOW8iJKm\\nIn October 2015 - the 'knife intifada' was in full swing. We were told then that the reason Arabs were murdering innocent Jews was because the ‘status quo’ on the Temple Mount was being threatened. If that is true - then let us step back a year. https://t.co/6zwGVcuSc2\\nIt is 2014. The status quo on the Temple Mount is not being threatened. There's an attack by a 16-year-old terrorist who stabs Jews at a supermarket in Mishor Adumim. Western media say it was because of frustration from the Gaza conflict. If this is true, let us go further back. https://t.co/qNNVx7tudr\\nMarch 2004. There's no seige on Gaza. No pressure cooker. 2 Gaza terrorists kill 10 Israelis in Ashdod. The reason? Gaza is occupied. So Israel withdrew from Gaza, dismantled settlements &amp; what happened? They received Hamas rockets in return - but anyway, let us look further back https://t.co/uMzgGGRYZJ\\nOct 2000, Gaza conflicts are a decade away. Vadim Nurzhitz &amp; Yossi Avrahami ‘had their eyes gouged out &amp; were disembowelled’ by an Arab lynch mob. The given excuse for the violence of the second Intifada was Ariel Sharon's foot on Temple Mount. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/6d1bskaFtM\\nSept 1999. Ariel Sharon's foot has not yet gone to Temple Mount. Sharon Steinmetz &amp; Yehiel Finfeter were stabbed. The Arab said he murdered them 'because they were Jews', the media had none of it. They blamed the stagnation of the peace process. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/Cyt04c6Pw4\\nIt's late 1993 and the stagnation of the peace process is yet to be seen. 'Hope' is now the keyword. Yigal Vaknin was stabbed to death in an orchard. Hamas took responsibility. Media and politicians said they just did it to stop the peace process. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/SSLin2NaOf\\nMarch 1989. The Oslo Peace Process has not begun. An Arab worker in Tel Aviv stabs Israeli civilians on the Jewish holiday of Purim. Western press blame frustration at the occupation &amp; settlements for the violence of the first Intifada. If that is the case let us go further back. https://t.co/HuFBspOhq6\\nIt is March 9, 1978. A decade before the intifada. Terrorists hijack a bus carrying families on an outing. 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children, were killed. The excuse? Terrorists killed the Jews to stop peace talks with Egypt. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/8JWbKVnyiZ\\nIt is 1966. There is no 'occupation' and no settlements. The Arabs massacre Jews on trains, buses &amp; attack Jewish farmers. Western media placed the blame for the violence on frustration at the refugees created during the War of 1948. If that is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/imYr8yIhrm\\nDecember 2nd 1947. There are no refugees, no occupation. Israel doesn't exist. It is 3 days after @UN voted for Partition. Arabs riot in Jerusalem. 8 Jews are killed. Western media says this is just an Arab reaction to partition. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/lEecmimTdC\\nNov 1941. No refugees, occupation, Israel or partition. Arab leader Haj Amin al-Husseini meets Hitler. He helped form Muslim Waffen SS units and prevent 10000s of Jews escaping. Western media don't make excuses for this, they just ignore it. Which means we must look further back https://t.co/E88IfMOoqx\\nIt is April 1936. The start of the Arab revolt. By the end of the first week, 17 Jews were murdered. Media place the blame for the violence on opposition to Jewish immigration that was caused by Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.  If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/aFghguVVUJ\\nAugust 1929. There is no partition, no Israel &amp; no refugees. Abraham Mizrachi is stabbed to death - within days-  there are massacres of Jews in Jerusalem Hebron &amp; Tzfat. The excuse? The threat Arabs felt a Jewish presence brought. If this is the case, let us go even further back https://t.co/zT3MoLWebS\\nIt is 1920. There is no partition, no Israel, no refugees &amp;,little immigration. The Neba Musa festival. Jerusalem Riots had Arabs murdering Jews again. This time the excuse was disappointment at the non-fulfilment of independence. If this is the case, let's go even further back. https://t.co/BhKMPBXv4h\\n1910. We have left British Palestine, because it does not yet exist. There's no promise of independence, no Balfour &amp; no Mandate. Ariel Sharon's foot has not yet been born. We are in Shiraz for a massacre of Jews. The excuse? A blood libel. Let us look further back https://t.co/DTSv7wtQyc\\nWe travel before the modern Zionist movement began. To the Ottoman Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. The British are flooded with request from Jews to protect them. There are pogroms in Jerusalem in 1870 &amp; 1895 and in Jaffa in 1876. The excuse long forgotten. Let us look further back. https://t.co/EWGqBcoJXz\\nIt is 1834. Six years before the murder of innocent Jews in the Damascus blood libel. A pogrom occurs in Tzfat. Jews are killed and raped and homes and synagogues are destroyed. Other pogroms take place in the ME. In places like Aleppo, Beirut, Cairo, Mansura &amp; Alexandria https://t.co/DLidTkrJ8Z\\nBefore partition, before Israel, before settlements, before refugees, before Sharon, before the ‘wall’, before Hamas, before Balfour &amp; before Zionism. In the beginning there was an Arab with a knife and he murdered a Jew simply because he was a Jew. Enough with the excuses https://t.co/StB0gXr21b\\nFor the full story go to the blog. https://t.co/cIuBeLgA8s To support the research on patreon you can go here https://t.co/4lOGdmtMSJ or Paypal here. https://t.co/kPpEOKPEAB\\n\\nThere's too much media distortion.

Unbelievably, children as young as 4 months are taken from their parents, medicine is confiscated, &amp; medical care withheld, and LGBTQ and disabled individuals are held in solitary confinement.\\n\"The Trump administration’s immigration policies and detention camps meet the United Nations\\' definition of genocide and crimes against humanity. \\n\\nCongress is refusing to stop the president and his policies. \\n\\nWe cannot allow these atrocities to be perpetrated in our name.\"\\n(quote @ECMcLaughlin) \\n\\nPerhaps most terrifying, refugees are beginning to be moved onto military grounds, where there will be a complete lack of oversight from the media, lawyers, &amp; human rights monitors. Many of us thought we would never see anything like this in modern times.\\n“Now is the time for every person to stand up and say, ‘We will not accept this!’ No more hesitating. No more denial.

We are moved to mobilize with anyone: moms, dads, and people of moral conscience who cannot stand to see families and communities destroyed.\\nSimply put, our country is at a tipping point.\\n\\nEVENT DETAILS:\\n\\nOn July 12th, Lights for Liberty will shine a light on the horrific abuses of the Trump administration in human detention camps. People will begin arriving at 7pm local time at locations around the nation.\\nAt five main locations, legislators, activists, and organizers\\nwill speak until 9pm. \\n\\nAt 9 pm local time, at every detention camp (there are 200+ and at least one in every state), and in cities, towns, and homes around America, a silent sea of candles will light up the nation.\\nEl Paso, TX, where migrants are being housed in outdoor conditions under a bridge with no running water for months at a time, is the anticipated site of the main Lights for Liberty vigil. Legislators, activists, organizers, &amp; members of impacted communities are expected to speak.\\nOther key events are planned in: \\n\\nHomestead, FL, at a migrant child detention facility that has caused mass abuse and neglect; \\n\\nSan Diego, near the point of entry site from Tijuana;\\nin New York City, at Foley Square, where hundreds of migrants are processed through detention a day; \\n\\nand in Washington, DC, in front of the Capitol building, to demand action from Congress to end human detention and impeach the President.\\nDetails of exact vigil locations will be announced in the coming days.\\n\\nWe welcome all individuals and organizations who support an end to human detention camps to participate in a main or local event.\\nPlease email us at contact@lightsforliberty.org if you or your organization is interested in sponsoring or supporting an event in your area.\\nThese events are being funded entirely out of the pockets of our organizing team. We have no sponsors and will not be asking for any financial contribution for these events.\\nWe will invite the public to directly contribute to organizations supporting migrant refugees on our donations page of our website.\\nThis moment has the opportunity to be a turning point in our nation’s history, a moment in which we bring these camps out of the shadows, stop America’s rapid slide into unspeakable horror, and demand that our country stand up for the values it strives to uphold.\\nWe invite you to stand beside us on the right side of history on July 12th.\\n\\nFor more information please visit our website: https://t.co/hROv6uvKF7\\nAnd in the interim, from now until the end of this administration and its horrific policies, we invite you to light a candle in our window to keep vigil for all those still held in Trump\\'s detention camps, and all those persecuted, marginalized and harmed by this administration.',\n",

       " 'hilo 325': '(THREAD) BREAKING: In a stunning development in the Trump-Russia investigation, former top Trump aide Sam Nunberg says he will defy a Mueller subpoena, thereby risking incarceration. I discuss the context and implications of this development here. \\n\\nHope you\\'ll read on and share. https://t.co/IYubC1NeUe\\n1/ Nunberg has become a well-known figure in the Trump-Russia saga due to him acknowledging that he\\'s intentionally lied to the media in the past—requiring journalists to issue caveats whenever they cite him—and saying Don Jr. told his dad about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.\\n2/ The importance of this second point can\\'t be overstated—as Nunberg is the second top Trump aide (with Bannon) to publicly express certainty Don Jr. told his dad of the campaign\\'s secret meeting with Kremlin agents at Trump Tower on or around the time it happened. This matters.\\n3/ If Trump knew of the Trump Tower meeting with Kremlin agents at the time it happened, Trump may be responsible for a series of federal offenses relating to how he worked to cover up the nature of the meeting afterward and his knowledge of Russian ambitions/actions post-June.\\n4/ More importantly, Sam Nunberg just said on MSNBC that he believes \"Trump may have done something [illegal]\" during the presidential campaign, but he doesn\\'t know what yet. He bases his opinion on interactions with the Trump campaign after he and Roger Stone were fired from it.\\n5/ Nunberg met with Mueller a week ago, and it\\'s clearly that meeting that led to Mueller issuing a subpoena for any and all emails between Nunberg and certain Trump aides—basically, any Trump-Russia figure you could think of, including the president himself—since November 2015.\\n6/ Nunberg told MSNBC his meeting with Mueller focused on whether he (Nunberg) heard discussions of Trump Tower Moscow plans during the presidential campaign, and/or whether he saw any signs that Trump was developing U.S.-Russia policy on the basis of his ongoing business deals.\\n7/ During the course of his interview with MSNBC, Nunberg revealed that he did think that Trump was constantly aware throughout the presidential campaign of how his policies could affect his business—as he didn\\'t expect to win. I and others have been saying this for many months.\\n8/ Nunberg also said Mueller wants him to testify for a grand jury Friday to incriminate Trump advisor/confidant Roger Stone, who I wrote days ago—see below—can now be indicted at a time of Mueller\\'s choosing for lying to Congress. Looks like I was correct.https://t.co/IcT6bxWAxJ\\n9/ Nunberg is a Stone mentee, and his reasons for not wanting to cooperate with Mueller\\'s subpoena are clearly pretextual—meaning, he\\'s suddenly realized that while he can *say* what he wants to Mueller, his *emails* may, if he\\'s compelled to produce them, tell a different story.\\n10/ Why do I say his excuses are pretextual? A week ago he told MSNBC the Mueller probe *isn\\'t* a \"witch hunt,\" and now that he\\'s being asked to produce his correspondence on the question, he suddenly says that it *is* a \"witch hunt.\" So clearly he has something he wants to hide.\\n11/ Why else do I say his excuses are pretextual? Because he\\'s disregarding his attorney\\'s advice. (He says his lawyer is likely to \"fire\" him.) Why else? Because his main reason for not complying—he says—is *it\\'d take too long to find all the emails requested*.\\n\\nYes, seriously.\\n12/ Why else do I say Nunberg is refusing to produce documents for clandestine reasons? Because he\\'s not just objecting to producing emails that could hurt Stone or be professionally embarrassing—he\\'s *also* saying him having to produce emails to the president is \"over the line.\"\\n13/ So Nunberg is worried about his emails to Stone, and also, apparently, worried about his emails to and from Donald Trump—a man he now admits he believes \"did something wrong [illegal]\" during the 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps his emails reflect that knowledge or belief?\\n14/ There\\'s more—and it\\'s also stunning. Nunberg has perhaps inadvertently given us a view into exactly *what* he thinks Trump may have done wrong, as he told MSNBC repeatedly (and he brought this up voluntarily) that it\\'d be \"fine\" if Trump wanted Russia to release Clinton dirt.\\n15/ To be clear, it would *not* be fine.\\n\\nIt would likely be Conspiracy to Commit Computer Crimes or Aiding and Abetting Computer Crimes or some sort of Bribery charge if Trump communicated directly or indirectly with the Russians about releasing their *stolen* Clinton materials.\\n16/ Take all Nunberg said and a scenario emerges: Nunberg said Trump knew of the June 2016 meeting because subsequent correspondence with the president or someone else confirmed to Nunberg that Trump knew of it and—after—tried to secretly facilitate Russia releasing Clinton dirt.\\n17/ Nunberg, in this view, is refusing to comply not just because he doesn\\'t want to hurt Stone—though that may be so—or because complying with the subpoena could hurt him (though that may be so), but because he thinks his emails may lead toward the discovery of some larger plot.\\n18/ In his interview with MSNBC, Nunberg took the disconcerting tack of implying that he will be, he hopes, just \"the first\" of many former Trump aides to decide that the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and they shouldn\\'t comply with it. That is dangerous, lawless rhetoric.\\n19/ Yet Nunberg is unsophisticated enough that he \"doesn\\'t think [Mueller] will do anything\" if he refuses to comply with a federal subpoena (spoiler—he will) and publicly says Carter Page colluded with the Russians—see below—so who knows what his deal is. https://t.co/XQ0dp8e50g\\n20/ The upshot: Nunberg will produce these emails or be held in Contempt and go to jail. He has no valid legal defense against production and—with each word he says—underscores why Mueller wants this evidence: because it *could* reveal a smoking gun. Per—it seems—*Nunberg*. {end}\\nPS/ No one thread can capture how strange these events are. For instance, at one point Nunberg tells MSNBC his proof no one is tampering with him is that he looked at \"no emails\" before deciding not to comply with Mueller\\'s subpoena. Minutes later, he says \"I reviewed my emails.\"\\nPS2/ I\\'ve represented enough defendants to recognize BS intended to cover a crime, so it was clear to me days after we learned of the June \\'16 Trump Tower meeting—where top Trump aides met Kremlin agents—that Trump knew of it. Do Nunberg\\'s emails prove it? https://t.co/iPxobfFsCM\\nPS3/ Was excited to hear John Harwood (NBC) use the phrase \"collusion in plain sight\" to describe Trump\\'s public remarks encouraging Russia to release Clinton dirt. The \"collusion in plain sight\" theory (quid pro quo by private/public statements) is one I put forward a year ago.',\n",

       " 'hilo 327': 'Thank you, as always, @KevinMKruse. An appended thread, if you don\\'t mind.\\n \\nFirst, @DineshDSouza, let\\'s make clear the eugenics behind the 1924 Immigration Act. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/nXCwcCl29K https://t.co/pOyUAfcmDb\\n2) The public focus on the 1924 Immigration Act revolved around its anti-Asian measures, the portion of the law known as the Asian Exclusion Act. It forbade all further immigration from Japan, China, and every other Asian nation. https://t.co/7Gj1bISEJ9\\n3) It was the culmination of a long anti-Japanese campaign fomented in large part on the Pacific Coast. And in particular, it was fomented by a man named Miller Freeman. Freeman was a publisher and land developer, and was the father of modern-day Bellevue, WA. https://t.co/ngaNhn7TUm\\n4) Beginning in about 1910, Freeman -- a GOP legislator and indeed one of the state\\'s most powerful Republicans -- began a campaign aimed at driving Japanese immigrants from the state, and Japanese fishermen from U.S. waters. It reached a fever pitch in 1919. https://t.co/tbGfFk8dxk\\n5) Albert Johnson, who hailed from the relative backwater of Hoquiam, was a protege of Freeman\\'s, and the two had a voluminous correspondence, which can be found in the Freeman archives at the University of Washington. I\\'ve read through these letters and many others.\\n6) Johnson, like Freeman, believed in the eugenics propaganda that was one of the popular subjects of the time. In particular, both had read \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White Supremacy\" and believed they were acting to prevent its predictions. https://t.co/sD3qzh26QL\\n7) This was a common thing among Washington Republicans, who made great hay agitating against Japanese immigration during this period. Various officeholders, especially rural legislators, found that piously talking about saving American civilization went over well with voters.\\n8) Gov. Louis F. Hart, a Republican, campaigned for his ultimately successful re-election on a promise to outlaw the leasing of any property by the Issei. https://t.co/aQKEk9lAPu\\n9)  One of Hart\\'s 1920 GOP primary opponents, John Stringer, took it a step further: “It is our duty to take every acre of land on Puget Sound away from the Japs and place it in the hands of our ex-soldiers.”\\n10) When the legislature convened early in 1921, a flood of anti-Japanese bills awaited. The first proposal would have made it mandatory to post American citizens as guards at any Japanese-owned hotel. Another called for an official investigation of the Japanese immigrants.\\n11) All these faltered in the legislative process. But the centerpiece bill—a land law that forbade ownership of land by all “aliens ineligible for citizenship,” and making it a criminal offense to sell or lease land to any such alien—flew through both houses unimpeded.\\n12) Flush with political victory, Miller Freeman had the final say on the matter. In an article addressed to the Japanese community, he minced no words: “The people of this country never invited you here. You came into this country of your own responsibility ...\\n13) \" .... large numbers after our citizens supposed that Japanese immigration had been suppressed. You came notwithstanding you knew you were not welcome. You have created an abnormal situation in our midst for which you are to blame.\"\\n14) In 1924, Albert Johnson, then chair of the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee, introduced a bill that would limit immigration to a 2 percent quota for each nationality, but prohibiting the admission of any “aliens ineligible for citizenship” -- i.e., Asians.\\n15) This was predicated in large part on a 1922 Supreme Court ruling, Ozawa v. United States, which ruled that people from Asian nations could be excluded from citizenship and naturalization.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/ErVSG2q2Br https://t.co/kfYnDAtpbN\\n16) Johnson\\'s racial attitudes were well known. He was the head of \\'The Eugenics Research Association\\', a group which opposed interracial marriage and supported forced sterilization of the mentally disabled. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/wRb1JC9kew\\n17) He believed in other components of eugenics, including its anti-Semitism. In support of his 1919 proposal to suspend immigration he included a quote from a State Department Official referring to Jewish people as \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\"\\n18) Johnson\\'s measure handily passed the House, but was amended in the Senate to allow for a quota from Japan. However, at the last moment, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge weighed in, claiming that a warning from the Japanese ambassador constituted a \"threat.\" The House version won. https://t.co/z0JTKywvLa\\n19) In Japan, the public had been closely watching the passage of the alien land laws with mounting outrage. And when news of the passage of the Asian Exclusion Act was announced, mass protests broke out in Tokyo and other cities. https://t.co/0YBfuKELTg\\n20) As Pearl Buck would later observe, the then-nascent movement for American-style democracy, which had been slowly gaining momentum in Japan, was effectively wiped out overnight. The military authoritarians who would control the nation for the next 20 years gained mastery.\\n21) Of course, one of the cornerstones of their rule was a bellicose anti-Americanism that would finally reach fruition in late 1941. https://t.co/hvb21qA4nF\\n22) Moreover, the groundwork laid by the success of the nativist campaign led to one of the nation\\'s great historical atrocities -- namely, the incarceration of 110,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. https://t.co/nqpVZh3z9l\\n23) All along the Pacific Coast, many of the men leading this campaign -- beginning in 1910, and continuing all the way up through 1942, when congressional hearings on the coast featured public testimony demanding removal of the Japanese -- were Republicans like Miller Freeman. https://t.co/SyDejEhYDX\\n24) One final note: The campaign described above in Washington state was replicated elsewhere on the Coast; both California and Oregon passed Alien Land Laws, and their congressional delegations joined in support of the Johnson-Reed Act. As always, both Rs and Ds participated.',\n",
       " 'hilo 328': '1. A few thoughts on Trump\\'s dinner in honor of evangelicals, which I\\'ll be discussing with @RickSmithShow later. Key context to consider is that fascism is concerned with defining who belongs to \"the nation\" or \"the people,\" and who doesn\\'t. Internal enemies (Others) are needed.\\n2. This dovetails neatly with the way in which fundamentalist believers police who does and does not count as a member of their religious confession. This is critical to understanding the Christian Right\\'s politics of \"religious freedom\":\\n\\nhttps://t.co/eyUgHlIICH\\n3. Indeed, as I have written elsewhere, \"Fundamentalism is authoritarianism in microcosm, or on the margins. Fascism is essentially fundamentalism in power.\" The vast majority of white evangelicals are authoritarian and fundamentalist.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/qZhVTc2QmK\\n\\n#EmptyThePews\\n4. One thing we can take away from the remarks Trump made while \"honoring\" radical evangelicals last night is that he still speaks their language very poorly, but their support for him has never been about him being one of them. It\\'s about power, control, advancing their agenda.\\n4-a. From a religious studies perspective, this absolutely does not make them \"fake Christians,\" and that framing is an unhelpful, usually defensive, deflection that detracts from formulating effective responses to Christofascism.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/weB1ftcusX\\n\\n#Exvangelical #Resist\\n5. Here is the transcript of the remarks Trump made last night. He names a number of the guests, all hardline evangelicals (including token minorities like Ben Carson) who have shilled for him. This is part of a pattern.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/n7cYs70rCG\\n\\n#TuesdayThoughts #EmptyThePews\\n6. While previous presidential administrations have made efforts (to varying degrees) to reach out to religious leaders inclusively, Trump gives conservative, mostly white evangelicals an unprecedented degree of access that is exclusive. As his base, to him, they are the nation.\\n7. Here\\'s an example of this pattern. Remember Trump\\'s Middle East trip? Guess what \"news\" organization got exclusive access to him to cover it? Why, none other than the Christian Broadcasting Network of Pat Robertson infamy!\\n\\nhttps://t.co/OaIEo4vvxl\\n\\n#EmptyThePews #Resist\\n8. Thus, when Trump speaks of \"religious liberty,\" he is speaking of giving evangelicals free rein, including to discriminate against others. That\\'s also their definition of \"religious freedom.\" Others don\\'t count. This is Christofascism, and it is in power. \\n\\n#EmptyThePews https://t.co/9DCLURdczW\\n8-a. Conservative Catholics are also on board with this agenda, of course. They pursue the same politics, but Trump has been especially cozy with evangelicals.\\n9. You can call conservative evangelicals out as hypocritical, if you want. But that accomplishes little more than preaching to the choir, so to speak. Hypocrisy, such as we\\'ve seen in Catholic abuse coverups, is integral to authoritarian systems.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/cA3NdhkGct\\n10. Christofascists are not going to be won over. I thus see the most effective means of opposing them as follows. The end goal must be to get them out of power. The means to that end, apart from the ballot box, is to delegitimize them in the eyes of the wider American public.\\n11. This means working to reframe our national conversation on religion, particularly about evangelicalism. We must get the press to at least quote ex-evangelicals, scholars, researchers who argue that today\\'s evangelicalism (and any fundamentalism) is incompatible with democracy\\n12. This is a hard sell in a country whose chattering classes exhibit a knee-jerk impulse to be deferential to any large (and well-heeled) Christian group. Researchers like @brucewilson and @FredClarkson who have been warning us about dominionism for years have faced ridicule.\\n13. We have, however, made some progress in changing public discourse on religion. A good part of that progress comes from the few evangelicals of conscience, and particularly from ex-evangelicals (or exvangelicals, or exvies), who have begun to be heard:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/zhn9wyWGNK\\n14. Journalists like @PaulHRosenberg, @ninaburleigh, @sarahposner, @SarahBurris, @NotoriousTIB, and others have begun to consider the #Exvangelical community to be stakeholders in discussions of evangelicalism. And that is critical to effectively opposing Christofascism.\\n15. #Exvangelical hashtag campaigns, like #ChurchToo (started by @hannahpaasch and @emilyjoypoetry) and #EmptyThePews (which I started) have gotten news coverage. That\\'s a good sign. We need more of it.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/xO5oAYHfCB\\n16. The #Exvangelical community is also working to hold more offline events, such as an upcoming roundtable and public discussion in Tampa, FL. Join us there on September 8 if you can make it! National media will covere the event. Exvie novelist @JosiahMHesse will be present. https://t.co/qQh8TtklxH\\n16-a. We needed crowdfunding to pull off the Tampa roundtable, The Exvangelical Community: Paths, Projects, Prospects, and you all came through. Thank you for that!\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Oz2YAJMzxU\\n17. If you want to help us change the national conversation around evangelicalism and toxic Christianity in ways that will help to delegitimize the Christian Right, one of the best things everyone can do is simply to listen to and promote #Exvangelical voices.\\n18.

To get back to the WH  dinner honoring evangelicals for their contributions to American society, a response that came from the #Exvangelical community was precisely highlight #EvangelicalContributions... in a way that is highly unflattering to evangelicals.

       " 'hilo 330': 'Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, today I have experienced the worst feeling I have ever had to deal with in my life, but first let me tell you my story of the past five plus weeks! It starts on the 31st March when a certain #StarCitizen \"Blue Haired\" Streamer contacts me! PT1\\nIn the conversation he tells me he might have to give up his K9 named \"Chewie\" a lovely Female German Shepard. I had met this Individual and \"Chewie\" in the past when he was working for JRDF. PT2\\nI went along to their base of Operations in Scotland to give a free Consultation to this Individual as I am a K9 Behavior Specialist so I knew of this K9 well enough to talk more about his problems he was dealing with. In our convo he told me his plans to move back to Wales! PT3\\nHe had moved back from Scotland and his plans had all failed on him, no where to live, no where to look after \"Chewie\". I instantly sent him £200 to his paypal via his Streams Donation page. I told him this was not to be repaid and to make sure he gets himself kept safe! PT4\\nAs he had not been paid yet I wanted to make sure he was safe as I had a good relationship with him from Streaming. I had said to him if he needed me to watch \"Chewie\" I would come for her to make sure he was less stressed out as one could be in this situation. PT5\\nHe then contacted me on the 7th April. He asked if I could watch \"Chewie\" for him. I instantly said yes. I do a lot of K9s it\\'s my job end of the day. As we talked it would work out I would be driving 18+ hours to collect her. I asked if half way by train was a option. PT6\\nHe agreed and I sent him the Train Fare of £200 along with another £300 to live. Plan meet in Glasgow (Scotland) it was going to be still a 8 hour trip for me. We met and was taken to my Car. We then headed back North with my two Wolves. She was very stressed and so was a I. PT7\\nI had taken time off Streaming to do this for him. I then took off the next day of Streaming to start the training process. I mean if she was going to be staying with me, might as well give her a full course of Training for nothing right? She started off well. PT8\\nI contacted him to find out Vet Details as I was offering to have her have K9 MOT and get fully boosters at my Local Vet. I never got a reply to the details, so she never got these needed boosters. Which I found strange but as she isn\\'t my K9 I never pushed for the info. PT9\\nShe was also very skinny so I started bulking her up to bring her back into normal weight area of a K9. I got her a special feeding bowl and explained what I was doing but I never got any hint that 2FUCKS were being given. No questions no asking about the K9 at all. PT10\\nShe was very poorly trained and I was noticing some special need symptoms. We went to work with her but sadly she managed to get her self on the bad side of my two Wolves. This was the start of some major problems. I was having to do double work. PT11\\nDouble work? It was meaning I had to walk 4x a day as they couldn\\'t be beside each other. Meant double training to do as I keep training my two. So I started to feel this Physically and Mentally. I was also doing fitness to lose weight a personal goal of mine and Streaming. PT12\\nI was also having to deal with having the Garden done and having a K9 (Mothers Dog) going through a serious operation so the timing was all wrong. Not his fault just adding this in to show everything from the get go was stressful on our side! PT13\\nI contacted him saying I was giving him a Cut Off time of the 19th May another 4 weeks from this point. I\\'m already stressed but nothing compared to being Homeless and Jobless. So I pushed on. I kept updating him but still ZEROFUCKS given. Never any MSGs asking how she was. PT14\\nWe are now at the 6th of May and I made a Phone Call to him to make sure he was prepped to come Collect her from me, was even going to offer I would drive her some distance to make it easier. NOTHING no reply, no phone back, zero answering so at this stage my heart sank! PT15\\nThis point I talked around to see if people had spoken to him, they did. That\\'s when I went FUCK I am going to be landed with this K9. So the past two weeks I have been really ill with Stress. Streaming, Physically &amp; Mentally tired but kept pushing forward for the K9. PT16\\nWell the 19th came, no collection, no phone call, never answering me via Phone/SMS/Discord, nothing... and this brings us to the WORST feeling I have had to deal with today. PT17\\nSo as someone who loves and works with K9s going to this next place is a heart breaking thing for me. Never have I had to go there, I don\\'t like people taking animals to these places as there is always a way out of it. So today I had to take \"Chewie\" to a Rescue home! PT18\\nI am a older man, I don\\'t cry at most things, people dying, animals dying and so forth. But I have been very emotional for the past few hours as I have never heard anything so horrible as \"Chewie\" Screaming like \"Help Me, Michael\" when they took her from me. PT19\\nIf it wasn\\'t for the fact she never got on with my two Wolves I would have gladly adopted her. But feeding 4 dogs, boosters and all is too much for me right now. As I am purely Streaming right now, I have no income, everything I do earn goes back into the Stream! My choice. PT20\\nI\\'m not looking for money back, I\\'m not looking for the time back. However I\\'m deeply disappointed in how someone like this could not only treat their Dog to abandoning it but how he has treated me when all I did was try to help him! I\\'m deeply broken today! PT21\\nNow why am I posting this on Twitter? Well firstly I wanted people to know my side of the story, I have not included names or linking people because well you can work it out for yourself. My story is written, it\\'s a good life lesson that some humans still prove TRASH to me! PT22\\nNow I am not saying unfollow, unsub this Individual, your old enough to make your own mind up. But just THINK before you support this person! If someone can abandon their K9, they will fuck you over for less. I have unfriended this person! PT23\\nI could never forgive this kind of behavior. It\\'s childish, its a cowardly way because all it would take was to talk to me and we could have sorted it like Adults. I\\'m sorry for the Rant Tweets but again I had to get this off my chest and vent! P24\\nI won\\'t be talking to anyone today, not in the mood, an emotional wreck right now. I will however be trying to Stream on Tues but will let you all know if I need to cancel. Thank you for reading this, REPLY/RT if you want, forgive me if I don\\'t reply back. END!',\n",
       " 'hilo 331': 'Oh hey.  Sorry for the delay.  Not on twitter all the time, Congressman.  This may take a while and I know how busy you must be but let\\'s start with substance then move to process. Shall we? 1/ https://t.co/SUwGMdH43t\\nOn substance, I think you know the answer.  And if you listened to the one person who is your colleague and who actually knows the border (and is from your party), you would understand why the dynamics of border security are fluid and require a layered, not static, response. 2/\\nThat would be Will Hurd so just read this first.  https://t.co/Wz0kLrBBA6\\nIf viewing better than reading, how about this:\\nhttps://t.co/bckDsvHkQh 3/\\nSo, why would anyone who lives, works or actually spent a career (I think you know my bio by now. . . ) in homeland security and border management not favor a wall?  The alternatives -- man/women power, technology, barriers (yes, lest you forget, the Obama Administration built\\nnearly 800 miles of barriers, drones, dogs, etc. -- are so much better.  See unlike a war zone (I\\'ll defer to you on that), a port of entry must permit flow.  It is how we function as a market economy. So us \"experts\" think about it in terms of how do we better \"secure flow\" 5/\\nbuild a wall.  So let\\'s take your example of the fentanyl arrest.  Think about it: it was stopped because it wasn\\'t a wall.  It was intelligence, man/women power, technology and DOGS that led to the arrest.  That\\'s how it should work; it\\'s not a sign that there is a better 6/\\nalternative with a static solution.  So I suspect you get this but I\"m happy to explain.  On process, though, you are the congressman.  And you know that your job is to weigh priorities with funding.  7/\\nSo let\\'s assume you have 100 pennies to spend across competing priorities.  And so let\\'s say you want ALL of them to be spent on border enforcement (not sure how your constituencies would feel about that).   8/\\nHow would you spend them? No one, not even CBP until last few months, ever even thought a wall made sense because it would take years (tell me how that solves a crisis, but as you know there isn\\'t one), require eminent domain (your Texas colleagues have thoughts on that), and 9/\\nwould pull from the dynamic security that does work.  So that us \"experts\" oppose the wall is just an unbecoming comment.  Us experts include your Republican colleagues and those of us who have worked border issues in government.  And, again, CBP.  10/\\nAnyway, I feel silly writing this. You know this and if you don\\'t happy to continue the conversation but one final thing.   . . about that mansplaining thing. 11/\\nI wasn\\'t going to re-engage it.  I don\\'t want to be know as the \"expert\" who accused you of mansplaining any more than you want to be known for an SNL skit.  It\\'s not why we do what we do; it\\'s personal and I took to heart what you said in response to the SNL skit. Civility. 12/\\nAnd as a graduate of Harvard, your odd mentions of it in every tweet to me (this is the first time I have mentioned it) suggests its a dig. I\\'m sorry you feel that way about what you may or may not have learned here. We try to teach responsible bipartisan leadership.  13/\\nSome of us have spent a career in and out of government, or media, or private sector, and the academy (she is me).  But I would take your interest in my opinions more seriously if they didn\\'t include such odd personal attacks.  14/\\nIt\\'s not becoming of your position.  \\nI wish you best as you assess this and your role.  And you engage with women and men whom you disagree with in a much less personal manner.  I believe the facts, history, economics and policy are against building a wall. You don\\'t. 15/\\nSupport your point with facts, history, economics and policy.  Not with mocking a woman.  Because, well, she is me.  And you will lose that one.  16/16\\nHi. So I\\'m back online and thanks for all these responses.  I was rushed when I wrote this so I think I\\'m allowed to continue because in the responses it occurred to me that the basic tenets of security were relatively new to folks and I\"ll try to arm you all with what I know 17/\\nto help in this debate. So back to substance.  Earlier I mentioned how we want fluid responses to support the (sometimes competing) goal of \"secure flow.\" It\\'s how we think about movement in our homeland.  (I\\'ll leave the moral and legal issues about a wall to others). 18/\\nBut there is also a second tenet for how we think about complex security challenges: layered security.  The basic goal here is to ensure that you don\\'t build a system around, what we call, a \"single point of failure.\" 19/\\nA \"single point of failure\" is to be avoided at all costs because if it is penetrated, then the whole system goes down.  9/11 and cockpit doors; Sony hack and a single system administrator; BP oil spill and a blowout preventer.  So, ideally we build systems that have multiple 20/\\nbarriers so that the access point is either avoided (i.e. you can\\'t get into a system through cyber attack because the system is layered and bifurcated) or difficult to access (i.e. lock the cockpit door, but have multiple security layers before entry to plane.) 21/\\nSo, on substance, the \"wall\" defeats those two primary tenets of protecting a complex system: balancing security with flow (the border and points of entry) and avoiding the single point of failure (the wall can be overcome by a ladder or tunnel).  22/\\nIt\\'s just a way to think about the substantive arguments about real security.  Moral debates are important; legal ones as well.  But it\\'s important that critics of the wall also have the tools to explain why we aren\\'t \"soft\" on security, but actually take it quite seriously. 23/\\nOk, I think I may have violated some unwritten rule of twitter and threads, but my objection to the wall (even assuming I could get it for free and in a day, which I can\\'t) are not just \"that\\'s not who we are\" or \"immigrants are good for America.\"  24/\\nI\\'m not known for being soft on security, border or otherwise.  And so in the realm of policy options, the wall fails every standard that we have learned in homeland security for the last 20 years.  Now, I say good night. 25/25',\n",
       " 'hilo 332': '1. THREAD: Did James Comey have the Wikileaks emails in March of 2016?\\n\\nYesterday, @15poundstogo asked an interesting question of @ProfMJCleveland: https://t.co/4qQogOFVZq This was something I had completely forgotten about. Let’s go through some background.\\n2. Back in 2017, Comey had testified, and a NY Times article had reinforced, that James Comey made the decision to announce that the FBI would not be charging Clinton in the email case (cont)\\n3. (cont) , in part because of “Russian intelligence” in the form of emails between the DNC/DOJ and Open Society that proved Lynch was attempting to stifle the case. https://t.co/XmM2rdJuKO https://t.co/kynAFg8mKt\\n4. In this “Russian Intelligence Memo” (Comey states he never saw an email, just intelligence) it states that there was an email between DWS and Leonard Bernardo of Open Society which read that Lynch had been in touch with Renteria (a senior Clinton campaign staffer) (cont)\\n5. (cont)  and told her she wouldn’t let the investigation into Clinton “go too far”. https://t.co/63czX3RU3z https://t.co/Ju5l6CGY8T\\n6. Timeline: James Comey receives “intelligence” from a “source” in March of 2016: https://t.co/gmMtc7QZIv https://t.co/uCYXEY29ZB\\n7. The DNC announced that it had been “hacked” by the “Russians” the week of 6/15/16 and relies on information from it’s “cybersecurity firm” Crowdstrike: https://t.co/a7yKNvJlzE https://t.co/owGLHW5dK4\\n8.  The story makes its way into the MSM in May of 2017. This may all be repeating old and tired news for you. I am about to add a really interesting piece here. This is where the lightbulb went off for me. Enter one @MichaelRCaputo\\n9. On May 22, 2018, Caputo did a spree of interviews that threw me for a massive loop. He began talking about informants who were approaching him throughout the campaign. This one in particular really grabbed my attention.\\n10. Caputo says that in the first week of May, 2016 he was approached by an intermediary, a former government official, who told him they had Clinton related emails at that government organization and they wanted to get to the Trump campaign  https://t.co/Fe92x0Hkd7\\n11. He states that this conversation occurred on May 6th, and would continue for several days. He states that this intermediary is willing to go on the record about these interactions and the facts behind them. He states that staff members of “the agency” (cont)\\n12. (cont) (which he can not name) said they had Clinton related emails which at the time he believes to be the deleted emails.\\n13. After Caputo leaves the campaign in June, the intermediary returns AGAIN, wanting to provide the information. Caputo does not want to take posession of these emails, and so he declines to work with the intermediary.\\n14. When this story broke, there was a big back and forth, with the contractor denying and walking back information- that is a sub story we wont get into here.\\n15. The real kicker comes at the end of the interview with Cavuto. Caputo states, that at the time, the intermediary spoke about the content of some of the emails, and that one of them dealt with a Swedish waiver on Iran that was given at the time $26m was delivered to the CF.\\n16. Caputo was STUNNED when that information was released in a wikileaks Podesta drop in Late October.\\n17. Caputo states he went back to the HPSCI to clarify answers he had already given to the committee about Russians approaching him with emails, and that he shared the details of these encounters with Mueller, the HPSCI, Huber, etc. to no avail- no one wanted to touch it.\\n18. I spoke with Michael Caputo yesterday to hammer down some details of this story and he informed me that his attorney, Dennis Vacco, who is a former US Attorney for the Western District of NY and former NY AG shared the details of this with Durham yesterday.\\n19. Why is this important? Because it lends further confirmation to the fact that the US IC was IN POSSESSION of the “hacked” emails taken from the DNC and Podesta as early as March of 2016.\\n20.  It brings further confirmation to the fact that Comey was in possession of the ACTUAL emails and NOT a “Russian” intelligence document- meaning he likely knew back then what the \"hack\" really was.\\n21. It lends further confirmation that the US IC KNEW that these “hacked” documents would be released, and that a cover of “Russian interference and hacking” was placed on this leak to further perpetuate the narrative.\\n22. It insinuates that Comey knew and had in his posession at least some of the DNC emails before their publication, and I will leave the rest of the possible speculation to you. So to answer the original question? YES. Mueller SHOULD have investigated this.\\n23. To watch the video I did at the time explaining the story and lending more detail, please watch: https://t.co/hnS9U7gTou\\nI want to add to this - I am aware that the last dated email is May 25, 2016. However, this is too compelling to deny the fact that there is a possibility that the IC knew these emails were being taken the entire time, and since it WAS NOT a hack, couldn’t close the leak.\\nOf course, this is speculation on my part, but the corroboration between the stories is so compelling (as I said) that I’m willing to rethink the timeline. I think we have to be willing to rethink k established narratives and timelines. For that reason, my thread will stand',\n",
       " 'hilo 333': 'STUFF PEOPLE GET WRONG ABOUT ABORIGINAL HISTORY A THREAD\\nNo, we didn\\'t kill any pygmy people. There were no pygmy people here. I feel like that\\'s probably a very offensive term but I see this one doing the rounds quite a lot and it\\'s completely false. We are not the \"second Australians\" who usurped the land from pygmies.\\nWe didn\\'t arrive here four thousand years ago, or even forty thousand years. Every few years they find earlier and older evidence of our occupation here. Count is currently at 65k, significantly older than any living culture. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/sbUUeDRwrj\\nMany Aboriginal people, including myself, don\\'t believe in so called \"migration theories\" and believe that we were created here on this land. We have creation songlines which link many different language groups together with shared ancestral beings.\\nSpeaking of language - we had a lot of them. Around up to 700 dialects from around 250 different language groups. These languages were and are geographically situated and mob would be familiar with/able to communicate in multiple. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/82zVMYSNOw\\nThere is no cultural/spiritual origin for sexual abuse, cannibalism, or infanticide.\\n1788 was an invasion. Phillip had orders from King George to avoid causing harm to local Aboriginal people if at all possible, and was instructed to try to negotiate with locals so as to better acquire land and resources.\\nThere were multiple military expeditions/raids throughout NSW in the decades following invasion. MacArthur gave instructions to soldiers in 1795 to drive away \"the natives\", ie kill them and clear the land. That\\'s what the term \"dispersed\" means in many colonial records.\\nAboriginal people did resist invasion and did organise against settlers, attacking farms, stealing back resources, killing settlers etc. The punishment for these actions was typically far harsher from settlers and regularly involved the killing of women and children.\\nAboriginal people did help settlers on multiple occasions. Sometimes they were rewarded for this with land packets, money, and breast plates. Often enough, as in the case of Galmarra/Jackey Jackey and the Cape York expedition, they rejected these offerings.\\nDisease spread often before settlers. Disease accounts for significant losses even before some communities had ever seen a white person. It is almost certainly true that smallpox was spread willfully through the distribution of infected blankets, as had been done in the US.\\nMissions and reserves were usually terrible and oppressive places for Aboriginal people and many people died of poor sanitation and starvation. Missions = religious control, reserve = welfare/protection board. Aboriginal people typically didn\\'t have freedom of movement.\\nWelfare/protection boards were managed on state authority until 1967 and there was significant inconsistency in policy/practice. Aboriginal people were mostly considered wards of the state under the authority of these boards up until the mid 20th century.\\nBoards had the power to regulate residence, marriage, force unpaid employment, remove children, etc. In late 19thC the movement towards assimilation began and families were separated on the basis of \"blood quantum\", an imprecise science (it wasn\\'t science).\\nSpeaking of remains, stolen Aboriginal remains were being passed around in anthropology classes as late as the 1960s. There are no laws for repatriation of Aboriginal remains in Australia.\\nAustralia did have a slave trade, commonly referred to as Black Birding https://t.co/goruqoaQZZ\\nIn the 20thC after being institutionalised many Aboriginal boys were forced into unpaid manual/station work while girls were forced into unpaid domestic apprenticeships. Protection board knew girls were being raped in these positions but felt it was beneficial for assimilation.\\nLand Rights didn\\'t begin with Mabo, it began with Invasion. There was the handover of land to the Gurindji peoples in 1975 after almost a decade of political organising which preceded Mabo.\\nThe 1967 didn\\'t give us the right to vote or to be citizens, those rights came in gradually in the 20thC depending on state, but voting wasn\\'t encouraged or accessible. 67 gave us the right to be counted in the census, and for the federal gov to make laws regarding us.\\nThe gov has a bad history in its use of these powers, often operating alongside the repeal of the Racial Discrimination Act in cases such as Hindmarsh Bridge and the NT Intervention.\\nWe were never considered flora and fauna. Honestly a lot of the time we had less rights than that. Altho the management of Aboriginal affairs did at one stage come under a flora and fauna portfolio, which is probably where that myth comes from.\\nAboriginal people have been writing for a long time. First western-recognised form of authorship comes in the form of Bennelong\\'s 1796 letter to Lord Sydney\\'s steward. First written petition for land was in 1832 from Maria Lock. First book from David Unaipon in 1928.\\nThis one’s a biggun: YES WE DID HAVE AGRICULTURE! The denial of systems of farming and land cultivation is central to the denial of our rights and sovereignty to the land BUT we totally cultivated the land and still practice things like fire stick farming \\nhttps://t.co/Hh6KtaAHL7\\nTerra nullius was never “declared”, it only appeared in legal usage/documentation in the 20th century. The notion that Aboriginal people didn’t sufficiently fulfil western criteria for land possession was certainly around at invasion but it wasn’t formalised as a doctrine\\nAboriginal is a demonym which means it must be capitalised. The preferred language is humanising - so Aboriginal people vs Aborigines etc. We have over 200ys of being called black and we have reclaimed that language for our use - ie black, blackfellas, Blak (see Destiny Deacon)',\n",

       " 'hilo 335': 'Thread: A picture is worth a thousand words, and your brain needs billions of neurons to process it. Why do we need so many neurons? To find out, we recorded thousands of them in mouse visual cortex. Here’s some data, and a link to the paper:\\nhttps://t.co/XsrxRsLzS1 https://t.co/fnfySyoEH0\\n2. One reason to have so many neurons may be that they each have different jobs: \\nNeuron A recognizes the pointedness of a fox’s ears,\\nNeuron B recognizes the color of the fox’s fur. \\nNeuron C recognizes a fox nose, \\netc https://t.co/1t5hOn1WKn\\n3. When enough of these neurons activate, the brain as a whole can recognize a fox. https://t.co/ZVk3zPj0YS\\n4. What if some neurons “fall asleep” on the job and don’t respond to the image? This actually happens very often, and yet the brain is remarkably robust to these failures.\\n5. Even if 90% of the neurons don’t do their job, we can still recognize the fox. Even if we randomly change 90% of the pixels, we can still recognize the fox. The brain is robust to a lot of manipulations like that. https://t.co/7oi9bOm9UL\\n6. Artificial neural networks also use millions of neurons to recognize images. https://t.co/sOY5Emm3Qa\\n7. Unlike brains, machines are not so robust to small aberrations. Here is our fox and next to it the same fox very slightly modified and now the machine thinks it’s a puffer fish! https://t.co/Bd9ZDyY7QJ\\n8. These are called “adversarial images”, because we devised them to fool the machine. How does the brain protect against these perturbations and others?\\n9. One protection could be to make many slightly different copies of the neurons that represent foxes. Even if some neurons fall asleep on the job, their copies might still activate.\\n10. However, if the brain used so many neurons for every single image, we would quickly run out of neurons!\\n11. This results in an evolutionary pressure: it’s good to have many neurons do very different jobs so we can recognize lots of objects in images, but it’s also good if they share some responsibilities, so they can pick up the slack when necessary.\\n12. We found evidence for this by investigating the main dimensions of variation in the responses of 10,000 neurons. Below, each column is one neuron’s responses to several of our images. https://t.co/UZqDjTaKv4\\n13. The largest two dimensions were distributed broadly across all neurons, as you see below. Any neuron could contribute to these and pick up the slack if the other neurons did not respond. https://t.co/AtES0KSNR1\\n14. The next 8 dimensions each were smaller and distributed more sparsely across neurons. If a neuron was asleep, it was still likely a few others could represent these dimensions in its place. https://t.co/7Dqnes6lUQ\\n15. The next 30 dimensions revealed ever more intricate structure... https://t.co/v8dZtUJgbp\\n16. And so did the next 160 dimensions... https://t.co/rlEpkoOIMi\\n17. And so on, this kept on going, with the N-th dimension being about N times smaller than the biggest dimension.\\n18. This distribution of activity is called a “power-law”. https://t.co/IiWTda0nwI\\n19. However, this was not just any power-law, it had a special exponent of approx 1. We did some math and showed that a power-law with this exponent must be borderline fractal.\\n20. A fractal is a mathematical object that has structure at many different spatial scales, like the Mandelbrot set below: https://t.co/WTARMWiym4\\n21. This Inceptionism movie is also a kind of fractal: https://t.co/icQEakUayT\\n22. The neural activity was so close to being a fractal, and just barely avoided it because it’s exponent was 1.04, not 1 or smaller.\\n23. An exponent of 1.04 is the sweet spot: as high-dimensional as possible without being a fractal.\\n24. Not being a fractal allows neural responses to be continuous and smooth, which are the minimal protections neurons need so that we don’t confuse a fox with a puffer fish!\\nAll the neural data is available here: https://t.co/5Qr0Ry8rY7\\n\\nAnd the code is here: https://t.co/zGfNMUEy7m',\n",

President Trump didn’t wake up one morning and decide to run. He has planned his ascent to presidency for a long time.\\n2. He does nothing without knowing its eventual consequences, regardless of how it may look on the outside. The first recorded “presidential speech” given by Trump occurred on October 22 1987. Yes its not a typo. https://t.co/Q2SPgT8UF2\\n3. His speech was remarkably similar to what currently says, on that day he said: “I\\'m not here because I\\'m running for President.

On Oct 7, 1999 edition of Larry King Live Trump announced announced creation of a presidential exploratory committee. Jesse Ventura persuaded Trump to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party. Trump eventually dropped out, citing party\\'s inability to unite.\\n6. He called Pat Buchanan, another reform party candidate a “Hitler-Lover” in response to Pat’s contention that Hilter presented no serious threat to the United States in WW 2. \\nhttps://t.co/PaJaHgvCyh\\n7. On Jan 1 2000 he released his book “ the America we deserve” he said “I really am convinced we\\'re in danger of sort of terrorist attacks that will make 1993 bombing of WTO look like kids playing with firecrackers\"\\n8.\"A liberal policy of immigration may reflect confidence and generosity. But our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.”\\n9. February 14, 2000, Trump withdrew from race citing infighting in Reform Party knowing he couldn\\'t win both because of its direction and membership, including David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani who he described as Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively.\\n10. Trump wrote an editorial in NYT entitled “What I saw at the revolution”,  he wrote: “I seriously thought that America might be ready for a businessman president, someone with an eye for the bottom line, someone who has created thousands of jobs”\\n11. \"I felt confident that I could sell the American people if I could get into the debate I preferred race against Bush and Gore, two establishment politicians whose nominations looked certain and whose issue positions seemed virtually indistinguishable”\\n12. I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep” “I Saw VP Gore trudging through the snow in subzero temperatures, knocking on doors in New Hampshire, a look of drudgery on his face.\\n13.

I had enormous fun thinking about a presidential candidacy and count it as one of my great life experiences.” “I cannot rule out another bid for the presidency in 2004.”\\nhttps://t.co/Z9DWm34VB4\\n14. In 2003 Trump began hosting The Apprentice, he thought about a presidential run in 2004, decided not to join the race. During 2012 presidential race, he once again considered running. Few polls even put Trump in second place in the GOP presidential field, behind Mitt Romney.\\n14. He decided not to run saying “I maintain strong conviction that if I were to run, I would be able to win the primary and general election” \"I have spent the past several months unofficially campaigning and recognize that running for public office cannot be done half-heartedly\\n16.

       " 'hilo 338': \"1. Oh, the Democrats are scandalized! They are outraged by the treatment of immigrant kids in concentration camps on the southern border!\\n2. How can this happen? they tell us. How can the United States, land of the free, the home of the brave, treat the poor and the tired and the hungry as if they were political prisoners remanded to the Gulag?\\n3. Well, I’ll tell you. It’s not only because the president and his administration are fascist. To be sure, the Democrats did not launch a “zero tolerance” policy that belies federal law and the human right to asylum.\\n4. No, the Democrats are not building walls. No, the Democrats did not unleash, as Donald Trump did, the closeted Aryans of US Customs and Border Patrol. But the Democrats have done plenty to contribute to this debacle.\\n5. The Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, once believed the Republicans were dealing in good faith when they demanded security in exchange for supporting immigration reform.\\n6. To that end, the Obama administration, with the blessing of congressional Democrats, spent billions and billions to secure the southern border. (This was in keeping with the previous administration’s post-9/11 military buildup.)\\n7. The Obama administration, moreover, deported more people than all presidents combined (up to that point). Sure, the Democrats were splitting up immigrant families but the hope was from pain would come reform, specifically a pathway to citizenship.\\n8. The Republican leadership, however, never intended to work with the administration on immigration reform. To be sure, some “moderates” like US Senators Lindsey Graham and the late John McCain tried and succeeded in crafting deals with Senate Democrats.\\n9. But even they surely knew it didn’t matter what they did. Every time the Senate passed an immigration package, the House killed it.\\n10. Why? By 2013, the Republican base had decided anything short of a border lock-down was dangerously insecure. The party’s base had decided anything smacking of reform smacked of amnesty. These were and are impossible standards, and the Republicans knew it.\\n11. But as long as the Democrats kept thinking they could satisfy those standards, as long as the Democrats kept throwing money at the border while waiting for the right-wing fever to break, the GOP was happy. It took pleasure in its advantage.\\n12. And it continues to, even though it is establishing concentration camps to shelter what can only be called political prisoners, people jailed not for doing something wrong—they have the legal right to seek asylum per law—but for being disliked by the current president.\\n13. None of this would have been possible if the Democratic Party had not accepted for years for the sake of political expediency the Republican Party’s utter and toxic bad faith.\\n14. None of this would have been possible without the billions and billions that went into securing the border over the last two decades.\\n15. Concentration camps and the criminal treatment of innocent kids scandalized the Democrats this week but none of it would have been possible without complicity on the part of the Democrats.\\n16. Borders do not define a nation. Borders reflect a nation, meaning that problems on the border tend to reflect problems elsewhere in the body politic so that the more attention paid to the nation’s borders, the less attention is paid to the nation's real problems.\\n17. Put another way, the Democrats, in playing along with the Republicans, are not only surrendering their political leverage; they are drawing attention away from issues where they have a much stronger hand.\\n18. Imagine if instead of spending billions on “border security,” the Democrats fought instead to deregulate the southern border in the name of openness, free labor and free enterprise.\\n19. Here’s how Manlio Graziano put it in his short book, What Is a Border? He said:\\n20. Each proposed false solution to a real problem only ends up creating new problems. The real problem ... has opened the floodgates to the excessive passion for borders is the shifting of power, that is, the shifting of the economic ... geopolitical axis of the world.\\n21. Graziano: Thinking the problem can be resolved by strengthening borders is like thinking that one can lose weight by breaking the scale. Indeed, it’s much worse: breaking the scale at the most leads to a false good conscience and a few more pounds;\\n22. Graziano: coming up with false solutions to real political problems allows us to have a good conscience for only a bit longer because there will inevitably be new and more serious problems, setting off a dangerous downward spiral.\\n23. The Republicans, in making a fetish of the southern border, have been leading the way in America’s downward spiral, because the party has no good new ideas proportional to the political and economic challenges awaiting us in the 21st century.\\n24. That wouldn’t be so bad if the Democrats weren’t so eager to prove they too stand for security, thus contributing to a false solution to a real problem that’s only making things worse.\\n25. As in the past, the Democrats continue to accept the GOP's bad faith. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/MwwYeGfO5k\",\n",
       " 'hilo 339': '#Tweetorial time! 🚨 Looks like there’s another misconception about #cholesterol and #atherosclerosis making rounds again. This one has to do with the process of #LDL particles entering the arterial wall. So gather round friends and let me science the s*it out of this 🤓 (1/24) https://t.co/62dcEc6pR8\\nFor background, here’s a widely cited series of figures by Nakashima et al. (2007). They performed autopsies on 38 people aged 7-49, who died of non-#cardiovascular causes (2/24)\\nhttps://t.co/qMSuPNagwC https://t.co/cyiyu6OkYp\\nNakashima et al. looked for atherosclerotic lesions at different stages, according to a previously published morphological classification scheme. They found them, took slices, stained them to find #lipids and #macrophages and organized them nicely (3/24)\\n(It should be noted that even though the famous figure series now looks like it could depict actual progression of a single plaque, individual figures are obviously from different subjects and different lesions at various stages) (4/24)\\nThey present an elegant “time-series” of how lipids first appear in the vessel wall and then progress deeper and deeper eventually pooling into one great big mass. Lipids are followed by macrophages - cells that eat them (5/24)\\nThis is a GREAT illustration of the current paradigm of atherogenesis (“response to retention”), meaning that LDL particles enter the arterial wall, get trapped, aggregate &amp; become inflammatory. NOT some other sequence of events: https://t.co/Q1jL20flKf (6/24)\\nSo here’s the topic of this tweetorial: according to some, there’s something fishy in this series! Let’s look at the first image. Notice how the lipid stains appear quite far from the inner layer of the wall (endothelium)? OMG HOW DO THEY “JUMP” THERE!? (7/24) https://t.co/MFSyVX01AW\\nNow, if you’re the arrogant type at the peak of #DunningKruger Effect (AKA “Mount Stupid”), you might think “Gotcha!! I read this and now I know better than all the experts in the world! Clearly this disproves 100 years of CVD research!”. And you’d be wrong (8/24) https://t.co/zBd7EsPwwK\\nOn the other hand, if you’re a more moderate, critical thinker but a curious person, you might go “Huh, that’s interesting but I’m probably I’m missing something. I’m sure these folks who do this for a living have thought about this”. And then you’d be right! 😊 (9/24) https://t.co/HgioPmjBKO\\nSo what is the explanation? Before we get there, let’s take a quick poll: without checking, what do you think is the *scale* of the Nakashima images? (10/24)\\nNow, what do you think is the size scale of #LDL lipoproteins?\\n(11/24)\\nNow that we’re done polling, let’s get back to the paper and take a look at the scale bar in the corner of each fig. It’s 100 MICRO meters. Then, let’s remember that LDL particles are in the 20-30 NANO meter range. There’s a THOUSAND fold difference in scale! (12/24) https://t.co/6RFWwsfEzW\\nSo the short answer to the “jump mystery\" is simply image resolution. There ARE indeed #LDL particles in the area just below endothelium but they’re just too small to be seen. If Nakashima et al. had used a microscope with 800x magnification, they might have caught those! (13/24) https://t.co/JLlDjpukCi\\nThink of it this way: essentially the situation is analogous to looking at a satellite image of a city at a scale of individual blocks. At best, the resolution allows you to see large aggregate masses of people but not individual humans (14/24) https://t.co/3gLwZRNo1t\\nSpeaking of mass, back to red stuff. The authors are using a stain called Sudan IV, which turns neutral lipids (triglycerides etc) red. The accumulating redness is the build-up and fusion of nm-sized LDL particles to such a degree it starts to show up in micrometer-scale (15/24) https://t.co/xFCOh41711\\n“But why does it build up like that?” Great question, glad you asked! Aside from the scale bars, we now have to note the little arrows. They indicate something called Internal Elastic Lamina (IEL). It’s right at the border between two layers of the wall (intima and media) (16/24) https://t.co/sEs6HqCXEy\\nFor many macromolecules, IEL is an impermeable barrier. It has holes which are small enough for some HDL particles or albumin to squeeze through but LDLs simply don’t fit. This was shown in seminal work already in the 80’s: https://t.co/c80eK3Mzme (17/24) https://t.co/NGCuaytnFQ\\n(BTW, that paper is related to a line of research showing how the concentration of LDL particles in the wall is more than two-fold to their concentration in blood. The wall is a sticky environment to them and that’s why we don’t want them getting there in the first place) (18/24)\\nSo the red mass shown by Nakashima is essentially a massive amount of LDL particles hitting a wall and forming one great big pile of lipid that stains red!

That’s about as nuts-and-bolts as it gets in the military. (THREAD) https://t.co/GFX5sF0LLY\\nInfantry training is ongoing. Infantry units train constantly. All the time. It’s always something. To the point of being monotonous. If we weren’t at the firing range, we were doing hands-on tactical training. If not tactical, then classroom prep. Always. Something.\\nThousands of hours of training and learning how to kill other people. I am a trained killer. That’s what an infantryman does. They kill. Other soldiers will laugh this off. “Okay, killer.” But they know I’m right. Deep down, that’s your purpose as an infantryman: to kill.\\nIt starts early. Basic training is psychological. You’re supposed to get comfortable with killing. You’re prepared to face this reality. In my barracks at basic training, there was a giant mural of a skull-and-crossbones on the floor. Our official nickname: “Death Dealers”.\\nWe were taught call-and-response chants. Ex: “What makes the grass grow?” “Blood, blood, blood makes the grass grow!”\\n\\nSo many drills have the cry “Kill!” in them. I’m surprised we weren’t required to shout it after eating a meal. Hell, we probably were.\\nI’m not here to tell you military training is bad. I am not a pacifist. Evil threats exist, and violence--as a last resort--is sometimes required. Someone has to kill. But that power has been frequently been abused by our government and held unaccountable in day-to-day life.\\nBecause someone has to kill and the killing falls to the military, psychological training like that makes killing easier. But regardless of where you happen to fall on this method of training, we need to take better accountability of it in the civilian world.\\nThousands of hours of learning how to kill other human beings. Day after day, month after month, year after year. Rewiring of the brain. It becomes second nature. Your body becomes fluent in the language of killing.\\nI’m a flaming liberal. I’m a gun owner but don’t collect them. My idea of “fun” is singing karaoke in a tiara, not a day shooting guns. But there is no doubt in my mind that, if needed, I could kill other human beings efficiently. Tactically. Without hesitation. That\\'s training.\\nI haven’t worn a uniform in almost seven years, but it would be like riding a bike. It’s ingrained. I doubt it’ll ever go away. That’s the point of military training: muscle memory, acting without hesitation, resorting to a part of your brain on autopilot.\\nIn April 2009, Homeland Security released a report warning of the recruitment of veterans by radical groups: https://t.co/Lahh8xZgrn https://t.co/B5w5bZBcJd\\nWhite supremacy tied to military training was noted as a catalyst for a heightened national security risk, which is basically what we’ve seen come to fruition a decade later: https://t.co/mdEB59eVA3\\nPredictably, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano was derided as disrespecting the troops. She was forced to issue several apologies. Never mind that Napolitano had only ever demonstrated the utmost respect for our folks in uniform.\\nNever mind that a 2008 FBI report identified 203 military veterans in white supremacist terrorist groups: https://t.co/wwaNe9t6D8 https://t.co/1tAS90V9Vo\\nNever mind Charlottesville and the mix of military vets among the little boys playing soldier: https://t.co/kFDqERjGkc\\nNever mind that a Marine killed JFK or that an Army infantryman was behind the Oklahoma City Bombing or the numerous instances of war veterans committing violent crimes using their training. Example: U.S. Army Rangers robbing a bank. https://t.co/Vft4mNumAu\\nOr the higher rate of violence against women (in this case: IPV) among Active Duty military and veterans versus civilians: https://t.co/TcSoFGHDJ7\\nOr that the higher rate of IPV in the military is linked to PTSD and traumatic brain injuries: https://t.co/9ei4CHp0DA\\nOr—and this is important—the well-established relationship between mass shootings and violence against women. A great piece on that subject by Rebeca Traister can be found here: https://t.co/TRdgM1iMc2 https://t.co/QfusLscxTV\\nSurely, that link between violence against women and subsequent mass shootings must count as evidence of terrorism. This is how the FBI defines domestic terrorism: https://t.co/mFOgrDWyB1 https://t.co/uACnt7uPhd\\nNot sure why a mass shooting inspired by hatred of women doesn’t qualify as terrorism… unless, maybe, we don’t respect women as people? Not exactly the most comfortable truth in the national discourse.\\nWhite men are seeing a loss of power, feel victimized, have that irrational entitlement radicalized through white supremacist propaganda, and commit acts of terrorism.\\nBut because they’re white and not shouting “Allahu Akbar”, they’re dismissed as \"nuts\", or more charitably: “nice guys gone wrong.” To admit to “terrorism” by ordinary white men would require asking deeper questions of ourselves, especially those of us in power, i.e. White House.\\nTo admit to “terrorism” by military veterans would require a vast reworking of our systems of recruitment, training, and mental health. Instead, we grant an access of powerful weaponry to those most trained to use it and most likely to do so in brutal acts of terrorism.\\nAn irony of all this is that though we fall back solely on the excuse of “mental health” to wave away acts of terrorism by white men, we neither 1) attempt to comprehensively address mental health in our country nor 2) effectively restrict access to weapons due to it. /thread',\n",
       " 'hilo 341': \"Libra whitepaper initial analysis: The only digital currency other than bitcoin that matters, and it could succeed massively. But it does not compete with bitcoin, it reinforces bitcoin's value proposition, and will likely need to rely on bitcoin if it succeeds. Thread👇\\nFacebook has some 2 billion accounts, and extremely detailed data on them. Its extensive data mining &amp; identity verification capabilities mean it has the potential to build by far the largest platform by user number of any financial institution.\\nTo on-board billions, Visa or Paypal need to go through people's banks to verify their identity, which is highly expensive, manual and unscalable. FB tracks your every move &amp; knows you better than you or your mom do. They don't need a bank &amp; can scale much faster.\\nAn international transaction on the Visa network has to go through clearance &amp; settlement through many financial institutions and central banks, entailing costs &amp; risks. On Libra, users can transact peer-to-peer through only one institution. The perks of 2b+ users!\\nLibra being backed by national currencies means it is backed by the USD, since all other national currencies at this point are backed by USD and managed by central banks to try to stay stable against the dollar. Other government coins are just dollars + issuer risk.\\nFor billions of people, a dollar-backed Libra on your phone globally is infinitely superior to national currency in market depth &amp; maintaining value. If it succeeds, Libra will likely destroy most 3rd world currencies, or force them to be fully pegged to &amp; backed by the US dollar\\nFor billions of people, a FB-based payment network will offer more and cheaper transactions than any other KYC/AML platforms. If it succeeds, Libra will likely eat most fiat payment processors like Visa, Paypal, and Western Union, particularly those functioning in the third world\\nDot not underestimate how powerful and beneficial such a network could be. If access to global finance &amp; the USD were as easy as access to a FB account, billions of people's lives would be improved drastically.\\nHaving said that, it's important to remember all of this is far easier said than done. Regulatory approval internationally is the main hurdle to overcome. But given the money, power &amp; influence FB has, they might pull this off.\\nBut to be clear, Facebook is building a centralized payment processor on the US dollar and calling it a blockchain. Like all centralized shitcoins, they've set up a 'Foundation' to pretend the thing is independent. They're even pretending its development will be open source.\\nAs shitcoins amply demonstrate, these pretenses are far easier to maintain in the whitepaper stage. Good luck to the Libra team keeping your development and blockchain open when people try to use them to send money to Iran.\\nThe foundation will remain independent until it tries to do something against FB's wishes. Will FB just allow its billions of users to seamlessly shift to a Libra they don't like? FB users' access to Libra can be turned off by FB, utterly subjugating the foundation to FB's will.\\nThe only functional advantage of calling this centralized system a blockchain is arguably in regulation. Easier to get things by regulators by using crypto buzzwords than admitting to just running a bank. Otherwise, everything would be more efficient if centralized.\\nFB's comparative advantage is in processing peer-to-peer payments between its members, not in building the monetary system on which these payments are based. As long as government currencies rule, FB are beholden by their regulators.\\nIn search of bribes, political favors, and attention-whoring, every politician worldwide will want to put barriers in the face of Libra. The French are already leading the way: https://t.co/AYwQJcYk4H\\nA global payment network governed by dozens of governments is unworkable in the long run. The 'monetary nationalism' problem Hayek identified in 1930s can't be solved with payment processors, it needs a global free market money free from government control https://t.co/NC1dpXntPG\\nNo amount of cryptography, blockchains, or independent foundations will stop you from being politically controlled, unless you are bitcoin, for reasons explained in detail in my book's last chapter: https://t.co/v0r3uJB3XR\\nFurther, no amount of appeals to 'decentralization' or 'blockchain' buzzwords will mask the fact that the system will be completely authoritarian, with FB maintaining full surveillance and censorship capabilities.\\nSo if it is to succeed, FB has to become the executive arm of the US Government's financial, intelligence &amp; foreign policies. And its decentralized foundation will have to do USG's bidding on everything from monetary policy to banking regulations and sanctions.\\nBut by increasing people's financial freedom while remaining politically controlled, Libra would be digging its own grave. All the problems of political money in the 20th century would remain, but people would find it much easier to opt out from than regular govt moneys.\\nThere are no armies forcing you to accept Libra, but a world in which everyone has their money on an app is a world in which everyone is a click away from bitcoin. History shows us hard moneys tend to kill easy moneys when the two are exchangeable: https://t.co/v0r3uJB3XR\\nBitcoin is hard money, it is apolitical, neutral, censorship free, and it can't even spy on you if it wanted to. All of these are things FB can never install on Libra.\\nFB shouldn't think of itself as competing with Bitcoin, as that's how they'll becoming an irrelevant stupid shitcoin like the thousands we have. In the long-run, Bitcoin represents the only chance for FB to build Libra on a global neutral protocol, and not on a political currency\\nSo, if govts let it, Libra will likely kill most KYC/AML fiat processors &amp; currencies, producing a global digital payment system based on USD. The problems it'll face then are the same problems faced by any political monetary system, to which bitcoin is the only working solution.\\nIn the short-run, Libra will only survive by being subservient to the USD &amp; pegged to it. In the long-run, it will only survive by being subservient to bitcoin and pegged to it. The only other fate possible is the life &amp; inevitable death of yet another irrelevant stupid shitcoin.\",\n",
       " 'hilo 342': 'Attorney General Barr has deliberately misrepresented key aspects of Mueller’s report and decisions in the investigation, which has helped further the president’s false narrative about the investigation.\\nAfter receiving Mueller’s report, Barr wrote and released a letter on March 24 describing Barr’s own decision not to indict the president for obstruction of justice. That letter selectively quotes and summarizes points in Mueller’s report in misleading ways.\\nMueller’s report says he chose not to decide whether Trump broke the law because there’s an official DoJ opinion that indicting a sitting president is unconstitutional, and because of concerns about impacting the president’s ability to govern and pre-empting possible impeachment.\\nBarr’s letter doesn’t mention those issues when explaining why Mueller chose not to make a prosecutorial decision. He instead selectively quotes Mueller in a way that makes it sound—falsely—as if Mueller’s decision stemmed from legal/factual issues specific to Trump’s actions.\\nBut, in fact, Mueller finds considerable evidence that several of Trump’s actions detailed in the report meet the elements of obstruction, and Mueller’s constitutional and prudential issues with indicting a sitting president would preclude indictment regardless of what he found.\\nIn noting why Barr thought the president’s intent in impeding the investigation was insufficient to establish obstruction, Barr selectively quotes Mueller to make it sound as if his analysis was much closer to Barr’s analysis than it actually was:\\nBarr quotes Mueller saying the evidence didn’t establish that Trump was personally involved in crimes related to Russian election interference, and Barr then claims that Mueller found that fact relevant to whether the president had the intent to obstruct justice.\\nBut Mueller’s quote is taken from a section in which he describes other improper motives Trump could have had and notes: “The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.” None of that is in Barr’s letter.\\nAs a result of Barr’s March 24 letter, the public and Congress were misled. Mueller himself notes this in a March 27 letter to Barr, saying that Barr’s letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.”\\nMueller: “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”\\nTo “alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen,” Mueller urged the release of the report’s introductions and executive summaries, which he had told Barr “accurately summarize [Mueller’s] Office’s work and conclusions.”\\nBarr declined; he allowed the confusion to fester and only released the materials three weeks later with the full redacted report. In the interim, Barr testified before a House committee and was misleading about his knowledge of Mueller’s concerns:\\nBarr was asked about reports “that members of [Mueller’s] team are frustrated…with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?”\\nBarr absurdly replied: “No, I don’t…I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.” Yet Mueller had directly raised those concerns to Barr, and Barr says he “suspect[s]” they “probably” wanted more materials put out, as if Mueller hadn’t directly told him that.\\nIn subsequent statements and testimony, Barr used further misrepresentations to help build the president’s false narrative that the investigation was unjustified.\\nBarr notes that Mueller did not “find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.” He then declares that Mueller found “no collusion” and implies falsely that the investigation was baseless.\\nBut whether there’s enough evidence for a conviction of a specific crime which Mueller thought was appropriate to charge is a different and much higher standard than whether the people whom Mueller investigated had done anything worthy of investigation.\\nIn truth, Mueller’s report describes concerning contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and people in or connected to the Russian government.\\nFor instance, Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner took a meeting with a Russian lawyer whom Trump Jr. had been told worked for the Russian government and would provide documents to “incriminate Hillary,” as part of the Russian government’s “support for Mr. Trump.”\\nIt’s wrong to suggest that the fact that Mueller did not choose to indict anyone for this means there wasn’t a basis to investigate whether it amounted to a crime or “collusion,” or whether it was in fact part of Russia’s efforts to help Trump’s candidacy.\\nBarr says the White House “fully cooperated” with the investigation and that Mueller “never sought” or “pushed” to get more from the president, but the report says Mueller unsuccessfully sought an interview with the president for over a year.\\nThe report says the president’s counsel was told that interviewing him was “vital” to Mueller’s investigation and that it would be in the interest of the public and the presidency. Still Trump refused.\\nThe president instead gave written answers to questions submitted by the special counsel. Those answers are often incomplete or unresponsive. Mueller found them “inadequate” and again sought to interview the president.\\nUltimately, the special counsel “recogniz[ed] that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily” and chose not to subpoena him because of concerns that the resulting “potentially lengthy constitutional litigation” would delay completion of the investigation.\\nBarr has so far successfully used his position to sell the president’s false narrative to the American people. This will continue if those who have read the report do not start pushing back on his misrepresentations and share the truth.',\n",
       " 'hilo 343': '1. THREAD  Himpathy: An unsympathetic but fair-minded assessment. \\n\\nHimpathy, forwarded by the philosopher Kate Manne, is either completely wrong or partially correct but poorly named and misleading.\\n2. Himpathy is the hypothesis that either (1) people generally sympathize with men more than women (hence the name), or (2) people generally sympathize with *powerful* men more than low status women (or \"their low status victims\").\\n3. Version 1 of the hypothesis, one that I often see people forward, is almost certainly false. So, let\\'s focus on that version before moving to version 2. \\n\\nFirst, it contradicts everyday experience. Women much more than men are used as victims PRECISELY because we sympathize.\\n4. In movies, harm to women is used to illustrate that somebody is truly heinous. The saying \"women and children first,\" although not always practiced, certainly suggests more concern for potential women victims. Our reluctance to allow women into battle, the same.\\n5. Furthermore, a priori evolutionary logic suggests that society would sympathize more with female victims than male victims (of equal status). I can\\'t go through all of sexual selection theory here, but the important thing is this: Females have the more \"valuable\" sex cell.\\n6. Think of extreme case. One group with 100 women and 25 men. The men could get all the women pregnant. The reverse, though, 100 men and 25 women, would be a reproductive problem for a social group, and a recipe for coalitional collapse.\\n7. Men\\'s sex cells are cheap; therefore, men are more disposable, especially low status men. This is why men have almost always been forced to die more often than women (in war, in dangerous jobs, et cetera). \\n\\nhttps://t.co/JtzD9AzlH5\\n8. Research supports this. Women are seen as more sympathetic victims. People want to punish male perpetrators more harshly. People believe women victims will experience more pain. And people support policies that help only women more than those that help only men.\\n9. To my knowledge, Manne\\'s only real response to this is to point to studies that show that people believe that men (boys) experience more pain than women (e.g., https://t.co/SYnLCdcPyI). However, as @ImHardcory and others have noted, there is a rather obvious explanation.\\n10. People believe that boys/men are more tolerant of pain and are more likely to suppress expressions of pain. Indeed, in the study cited by the WaPo, the effect disappeared when researchers controlled for perceptions of \"stoicism.\"\\n11. Think of an obvious analogy. If shown a film of an adult and a child getting pricked and displaying the same expression, most viewers would believe the adult is experiencing MORE pain. Why? Because adults generally react more stoically to pain.\\n12. Of course, nobody would print moralistic headlines \"Americans take adults\\' pain more seriously than children\\'s!\" And nobody would contend this supported a theory that people sympathize more with adult victims than with children victims.\\n13. Hypothesis version 1, therefore, seems completely untenable to me. In fact, I think observation, theory, and evidence all suggest that it is exactly the opposite of the truth; and likely it would be ignored if not ideologically useful.\\n14. Version 2, however, is a bit more plausible, if stripped of its sex-based formulation so that it reads, \"People value high status people more than low status people; and they sometimes let high status people get away with heinous crimes if the victims are low status people.\"\\n15. Of course, this ruins \"himpathy\" and makes the \"sympathy\" not a manifestation of the background misogyny of society, but rather of a natural propensity to favor high status people over others. In fact, the effect is almost certainly stronger if the victims are men, not women\\n16. In an interview with Vox, Manne forwarded two examples that support the notion that society is \"pathologically\" sympathetic to powerful men: The Kavanaugh hearings and Brock Turner. Yes, you read that correctly, Brock Turner. But we\\'ll get to that.\\n17. Manne uses Trump\\'s dismissals of Ford\\'s testimony about Kavanaugh as evidence of himpathy. Ford, according to Manne, was \"totally erased from the discourse.\" \\n\\nhttps://t.co/wZt6vASsuu\\n18. Trump is callous and boorish, so unsurprisingly he did not handle the situation well. \\n\\nBut (1) Ford testified and many, many people believed her (she was certainly not erased); and (2) attitudes about Kavanaugh were largely partisan, so this example is not useful.\\n19. The Brock Turner example was shocking to me since he is nearly universally reviled. Here is what Manne said, \"And what we saw, from his father and his friends, was this wave of sympathy over what the whole ordeal was costing him.\"\\n20. This is called kin-selection and tribalism, not himpathy. Of course his friends sympathized with him. And they would have if he were a woman as well. I\\'m sure many family members have sympathized with ruthless, cold-blooded women. \\n\\nHow does the rest of society feel?\\n21. So far as I can tell, very few people sympathized with him. He is generally depicted as a spoiled, privileged asshole who got a lucky break from an asshole judge. And many were outraged at his lenient sentence. Judge for yourself. Do a Google search.\\n22. Now, ask yourself this: If I used an example this ludicrous to support a theory that Vox and other progressives disagreed with, would they ever let it pass? Is there any evidence that most normal Americans experienced a wave of sympathy for Brock Turner??\\n23. What is true, however, is that HIGH STATUS PEOPLE probably do and have for a long time received preferential treatment. In many ancient law codes, including Anglo-Saxon and Roman among others, high status people were explicitly treated differently from low status people.\\n24. Although our law codes discarded this preferential treatment, it stems from a natural human propensity to admire and defer to high status people. So, in this very circumscribed sense, Manne\\'s hypothesis is probably 60% true. BUT, it\\'s not about sex.\\n25. It\\'s about status. It\\'s not himpathy. It\\'s hierarchy. And, my guess is that there would be an interaction such that a female victim would increase not decrease our hatred of a powerful perpetrator and increase not decrease our sympathy for the victim.

       " 'hilo 347': '(1) The story of #RubyRidge is nothing but heartbreaking.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a moment to discuss a story the Federal Government would rather be forgotten. A story of a family that only wanted to worship their God, raise their children, and be left alone. https://t.co/fJpOr5160X\\n(2) #StoryTime. Ruby Ridge is an outstretch of mountains in the northernmost part of Idaho, in a county named Boundary, as it rests right along the Canadian border, between the Washington and Montana borders.\\n\\nWhen someone wants to be left alone, Ruby Ridge is one place they go. https://t.co/tOI7Ey0qz0\\n(3) One person who wished nothing more than to be left alone was Randy Weaver. Weaver was a devout Christian &amp; US Army vet who had become disillusioned with his government; in the early 1980\\'s, he moved his family to a 20-acre plot of land on Ruby Ridge and built himself a home. https://t.co/hgIuTAYyQG\\n(4) He had no electricity. He had no running water. But he had his family, his faith, and the work of his hands, and with these he created a life for himself.\\n\\nBut about ten miles from where Randy chose to build his home was an Aryan Nations compound.\\n(5) Now, there is no evidence to suggest that Randy Weaver or his family harboured any white supremacist thoughts, despite what reports these days would say. But the Aryan Nations people were the only people around, with whom Randy could trade.\\n\\nAnd on rare occasion, he did.\\n(6) The Aryan Nations compound near Randy\\'s home had been, for a couple years, a target of the FBI. And when Randy showed up, he stuck out like a sore thumb.\\n\\nThis made Randy and his family a ripe target for the FBI to use. An undercover informant took advantage of Randy\\'s needs.\\n(7) When the informant learned that Randy was looking for work at the compound, he saw opportunity. So he asked Randy to saw off a couple shotguns.\\n\\nThis was entrapment, pure and simple. If Randy made these illegal weapons, the FBI/ATF would be justified to get a warrant. https://t.co/NBVC0LZMMn\\n(8) And they did get their warrant. They must have been thinking, \"If we can arrest this man, we can use him to get to bigger and more dangerous people in the Aryan Nations.\"\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what they got. The ATF arrested Randy in July of 1990.\\n(9) The FBI immediately asked Randy to turn State\\'s Witness against the Aryan Nations, and he refused -- not because he held sympathies for white separatists, but because he had once before been lied about and pursued by the government, in 1985. https://t.co/FcU6M2xboo\\n(10) In fact, the Secret Service, ATF, and FBI did nothing to assuage Weaver\\'s distrust of the government. They doubled down on their accusations of him being a white supremacist, a bank robber and wished to kill the president.\\n\\nIt was all untrue. And Weaver vehemently denied it.\\n(11) They could not hold Randy for long, and he eventually returned to his home in Ruby Ridge. But in December of 1990, a grand jury dismissed the bank robbery and treason charges, and indicted Weaver on charges of making illegal firearms.\\n(12) By this time, the ATF had built up this image in their mind. They thought of Randy Weaver in the same way we think of terrorists today: bunkered down with thousands of bullets at their disposal.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t just walk up to his house and arrest him,\" they convinced themselves.\\n(13) So instead, they waited. They knew Randy Weaver wouldn\\'t show up for his trial, and when he inevitably didn\\'t, they gained the help of the Marshals Service.\\n\\nSurveillance was set up all around the Weaver home. Snipers took up position at all angles. They watched and waited.\\n(14) When the Marshals were brought in on the case, they had not been informed of WHY Randy Weaver was being sought. No one told them about the shotguns. No one told them about the attempts to solicit a State\\'s Witness.\\n\\nAll they knew was this man was evading the law. https://t.co/3Zew363gIi\\n(15) There were three units. Two surveillance units set up a good distance away with sniper rifles, spotting and surveillance equipment, and one ground unit which happened to be trespassing on the Weaver property by a good distance.\\n\\nAnd Randy\\'s dog could smell them.\\n(16) Randy\\'s dog went after the ground unit. Very little information is known about what happened during the early stages, but what is known is that shots were fired by both sides, starting with the Marshals shooting Randy\\'s dog.\\n\\nAnd then Randy\\'s son, Sammy Weaver. https://t.co/Qr8kdCrdGK\\n(17) These were people of the forest. They didn\\'t get their food from the grocery store; they hunted and grew their food right there around their property. Every one of the Weavers was handy with a gun.\\n\\nAnd they fought back. US Marshal William Degan was shot &amp; killed.\\n(18) This drove the federal officers into a frenzy. Suddenly, dozens of FBI, ATF, and US Marshal units are being deployed in this remote mountain forest in northern Idaho. They\\'re ready to get revenge for their fallen brother in arms.\\n\\nThey think this is another Robert Matthews.\\n(19) And because they think this is another Robert Matthews, they decide that a surrender order does not need to be given. Instead, the federal officers are told they can open fire as soon as they see any armed adult.\\n\\nBut the Weavers are hunters. They\\'re always armed.\\n(20) The federal agents were prepared for war. Roadblocks were set up. Helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, humvees were brought out in an overwhelming display of force.\\n\\nAnd on the morning of August 22, 1992, all the Weavers wanted to do was see the body of their son.\\n(21) They head to the shed where Sammy\\'s body had been stored, and they take with them their weapons. A shot rings out.\\n\\nCRACKKK. Randy is hit in the shoulder. They run back to the house.\\n\\nCRACKKKK. Another shot goes right through Vicki Weaver\\'s face. https://t.co/InFlSnItQn\\n(22) Word came down the mountain quickly after Vicki\\'s death. Neighbors, friends of the Weavers, supporters, news crews had gathered down at the road up to Ruby Ridge, and her death drove them to riot.\\n\\nTheir worst fears had come true. A tyrannical force was killing Americans. https://t.co/Qbb1psJZe0\\n(23) Again, the history is skewed. People like to say that the roadblock was filled with skinheads and racists -- but they were a tiny minority.\\n\\nMost were just proud Americans, like you see in the picture above. Of 200-300 people, maybe 10 people were  from the Aryan Nations.\\n(24) After 11 days of stand-off, Randy Weaver eventually surrendered to the FBI. He was terribly wounded from the bullet in his shoulder.\\n\\nIt could have been avoided at so many points. The entrapment. The falsifying of charges. Shooting the dog. Foregoing the surrender order. https://t.co/WrjNKR0zHH\\n(25) But even now, more than 25 years later, the government cannot be honest about its failures at Ruby Ridge. \"They were white separatists,\" they say. \"It wasn\\'t our fault,\" they tell themselves.\\n\\nThe history is tweaked to give the government excuse. But we know better.\\n(26) All the Weavers wanted was to be left alone. And because of that, the government grew suspicious of them. Lied about them. Used entrapment to try and use them.\\n\\nThe scariest words in the English language really are, \"I\\'m from the government and I\\'m here to help.\" https://t.co/QNRL8fEPAj',\n",
       " 'hilo 348': '1. I want to talk about ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 13-years-old. To say it\\'s misunderstood (both by people who have ADHD and people who don\\'t have it) is an understatement. What people need to understand about those of us who have ADHD is we are not homogeneous\\n2. Because many people think those with ADHD all have similar symptoms and challenges, we don\\'t often get the empathy and support we need. ADHD is something we live with every day, hour, minute. It can ravage our lives and you may not even be aware of it.\\n3. When people have asked me in the past to describe what ADHD feels like I get into details about how it impacts my life every day but I always add that for me that ADHD has caused me a great deal of emotional pain. It\\'s a frustrating, infuriating disorder.\\n4. I want to be clear, I don\\'t speak for everyone with ADHD but I have spoken to enough people over the last two years with ADHD that I feel comfortable speaking about it publicly.\\n5. People who don\\'t have ADHD often oversimplify what it means to have ADHD. I don\\'t blame them, they\\'re not living with ADHD. But that\\'s one of the reasons ADHD is so misunderstood because it\\'s anything but simple. That\\'s why it\\'s so hurtful when people jokingly say \"squirrel\"\\n6. Whenever someone brings up ADHD. It makes it seem like it\\'s is just an issue of distraction. Wrong! For example, I read 2-3 books a week! I don\\'t know many people with ADHD can do that. But for me taking clothes out of the dryer &amp; folding them, that\\'s like climbing Mt. Everest\\n7. Those of us with ADHD don\\'t need your sympathy, we need your empathy. We need you to understand that we are capable of so much but just need you to understand what our limits and challenges are. We don\\'t want you to see our limits/challenges as excuses...they\\'re explanations\\n8. For example, people will often say that people with ADHD tend to procrastinate. That is a total misunderstanding of what ADHD is about. Procrastination has a connotation of intentionally putting something off for various reasons. We don\\'t want to be this way.\\n9. For people with ADHD the issue is often the difficulty starting things. It is enormously challenging for us in certain categories. The simplest things can be exhausting and feel impossible to begin/finish. It\\'s stuff that doesn\\'t make sense to people without ADHD.\\n10. Which is often why we hide these things that we find challenging because they can be embarrassing. I once had someone with ADHD, who made a good living, tell me that for years they would pay bills when things got shut off. It was a cycle they found nearly impossible\\n11. To get out of, it destroyed their credit, and it was only when they got married and their wife took over that they fixed their bill paying issue. People with ADHD hide a lot of shame in this and we hold it in because people don\\'t understand our diagnosis.\\n12. Because of this shame, we don\\'t talk about ADHD generally. We may talk about it with close family members or a psychiatrist but we don\\'t talk about it with our friends &amp; certainly don\\'t talk about it at work (I know this is a generalization and may not be true for you)\\n13. As egotistical as this may sound, I really hope to change that. I\\'ve been thinking about talking about ADHD for a few months and finally acknowledged how misunderstood it is among adults. Because we don\\'t talk about it, ADHD has a big impact at work and home.\\n14. Now, I realize that being able to talk about it is a privilege. People rightly fear that they could be seen differently at work or may not get assignments they deserve. This is a step-by-step process that will take a while...but it\\'s so important because ADHD has an impact\\n15. On people being successful at work and even getting a job. Some people think ADHD is over diagnosed...I don\\'t know if it is or isn\\'t, but I can tell you if it is, it\\'s over diagnosed in kids. It\\'s under diagnosed among adults. We know that if someone isn\\'t diagnosed\\n16. As child, they\\'re less likely to be diagnosed as an adult. Many people see ADHD (because of the hyperactivity component...which not all people with ADHD have) as a boy/man\\'s disorder...which leads many women to not be diagnosed.\\n17. At home ADHD can have a big impact on relationships, we have a hard time staying organized and tidy. This can have an impact on relationships. I have taught myself many tricks over the years but many people with ADHD aren\\'t taught to be mindful of their ADHD.\\n18. Want to know why I have so many towels? Yes, I can be bougie...I\\'ll admit it. But its because it allows me to keep my bathroom organized. I found that it was very hard for me, especially when I have a lot of things going on in my life, to lay my towel over the bar.\\n19. My towel would often end up on the floor and I didn\\'t want to live that way anymore. So I realized that if I just put a basket in my bathroom I could toss towels in there. Is it crazy to use a towel once and wash it? No doubt...but the alternative wasn\\'t very attractive\\n20. What I have learned about ADHD is that it can ravage ones life if you let little things slip. I knew if I kept dropping the towel on the floor, I wouldn\\'t make my bed, I wouldn\\'t put my clothes away. Then, that would lead me to get depressed with the state of my home\\n21. And that would then bleed into my work, etc. I have had mixed success explaining my triggers to people. Some think I\\'m making excuses or they just don\\'t understand why a simple thing like hanging a towel is a challenge. But I\\'m not going to stop explaining it\\n22. Last year I was meeting with a company that wanted to hire me and I told them I have ADHD and would find it challenging to work in an open office environment..the people I was speaking to understood that and were happy to accommodate it. But it hasn\\'t always been easy\\n23. One of the challenges for me is in order to focus on something like writing, unless I have the adrenaline that comes with not wanting to get scooped, I have to really shut out everything. But people don\\'t understand that I can\\'t do a back and forth when I\\'m in that zone.\\n24. In the past (before I learned what systems I needed in place) I would see an email come in from a friend or colleague asking to chat. I would tell them I was focused on work and they would often say \"it\\'ll just take a minute!\" They didn\\'t get if I gave them that minute\\n25. That there was a good chance I wouldn\\'t be able to get back to my work. People would get annoyed and think I was being difficult. That\\'s the reason I\\'m talking about ADHD now, I hope people on both sides of ADHD can be more mindful of what works and doesn\\'t work. (cont)\\n26. The best way I heard ADHD symptoms described was \"a Venn diagram with many circles.\" But it all boils down to this: we have things that challenge us, things that may seem simple/silly to you, but they\\'re things that can quite  take over and destroy our lives if not addressed.',\n",

Hint: neither reflects well on you. 24/25\\nYou are either saying you actually are a racist/homophobe/misogynist and it just makes you mad when other people know it, or you care more about money than people.

No shrimp smell remnants in the microwave or kitchen area. This was a professional hit no doubt\\nHOLY SHIT. He’s back. He watched the tape. He knows who did it.\\nSo the man who’s lunch was stolen sits across from me. The person who  stole his lunch sits RIGHT NEXT TO ME! She left for the day before the investigation started\\nAccording to the video, this psychopath DIDNT EVEN EAT THE FOOD. She took it out of the fridge and threw and buried it in the trash\\nHer motives remain completely unknown. In lieu of what he saw on the tape he has decided to not to press the matter anymore. I can’t say I blame him. We don’t know what this women’s fully capable of\\nPoints to clarify: he bought the shrimp fried rice around 11:30am (carry out) and put it in the fridge to chill until he takes lunch at noon. So she had exactly a 30min window of time to do what she did. There was no intention of microwaving the food\\nUpdate: Ok so when dude watched the video with HR they asked “what do you want to do about it?” he told them he was solely interested in who did it and that he didn’t want to be responsible for someone getting fired\\nAfter charges were dropped, HR sent a company wide email about not stealing people’s lunches.

hints of Trump\\'s knowledge of the mtg &amp; involvement in the false story Don Jr. initially put out. https://t.co/h17V9rYd7w\\n2A) Senate Judiciary Democrats released an Interim Report on the #TrumpRussia investigation. https://t.co/OsmPB5KDyN\\n2B) The minority report lays out inconsistencies in details &amp; testimony re: the Trump Tower meeting &amp; areas that need more investigation.\\n\\nIts intriguing that it says there are docs suggesting Russia funneled money to the Trump campaign through the @NRA. https://t.co/eJBh0hhnlm\\n3A) @SenatorBurr &amp; @MarkWarner announced the Senate Intel Committee has completed the first part of its investigation , which deals with Russian interference in our election, &amp; have written a report to be released after it\\'s cleared by the intel community. https://t.co/wKfxBjxXvP\\n3B) The bipartisan Senate Intel report will, contrary to the Republican House Intel report, confirm that Russia interfered on behalf of Trump and that U.S. intel agencies did an excellent assessment in January 2017. https://t.co/4wbvw8Xgzx\\n4A) @NewYorker reported that a law enforcement whistleblower gave the Michael Cohen SAR (suspicious activity report) to @MichaelAvenatti. https://t.co/iL1l3ctrkk\\n4B) The whistleblower leaked the SAR because two previous SARs it referenced had disappeared from the FinCEN database and he/she feared they were being suppressed by the Trump administration. https://t.co/UqgG8ww0a1\\n4C) Closely related, @RepMaxineWaters said on @MSNBC that she wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin in January to inquire if he was ever asked to destroy records related to Trump or his associates.\\n\\nShe never got an answer. https://t.co/8fCqtaplnf\\n5A) Rudy Giuliani asserted that #Mueller\\'s team had told him they will not indict Trump while he is president. https://t.co/F88UWlYYp8\\n5B) This is not surprising because #Mueller is subject to DOJ rules &amp; they provide that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\\n\\nHowever, it does suggest Mueller has moved beyond \"was a crime committed?\" to \"can I indict Trump?\"\\n\\n https://t.co/7wgNwkrAOC\\n6A) The former head of Qatar\\'s Investment Authority, Ahmed al Rumaihi, (who attended a 12/12/16 Trump Tower meeting) said Michael Cohen asked him for a $1 million payment for access to administration/infrastructure projects. https://t.co/IKu9RXK3oC\\n6B) This is the same al-Ramaihi who is said in a sworn court affidavit in the \"Ice Cube\" lawsuit to have told a Bannon friend that Qatar wanted to offer funding to Bannon after the WH fired him, &amp; when rebuffed, offered that Flynn had taken Qatar\\'s money. https://t.co/UAO9huaKk1\\n7A) Trump filed his annual financial disclosure, and it disclosed the loan from Michael Cohen (now repaid) to fund the $130k #StormyDaniels payment. \\n\\nTrump had previously denied knowledge of the payment, both directly &amp; via his attorneys. https://t.co/drc7P2qLJh\\n7B) @OfficeGovEthics referred the #StormyDaniels payment matter to #Mueller as potentially relating to one of his investigations.\\n\\nThe filing should have been made last year and various disclosure/FEC laws were likely broken. https://t.co/rCeJDJaJmC\\n8A) It was reported that #Mueller has subpoenaed Roger Stone\\'s social media consultant, Jason Sullivan, who worked on the Trump campaign. \\nhttps://t.co/IY8JWuUnrL\\n8B) #Mueller\\'s subpoena of Sullivan suggests Stone may be a target of his investigation and that Mueller is looking into his possible coordination with Wikileaks and/or hackers. https://t.co/iiD2b8Vc8i\\n9A) @nytimes had a major story assessing what was going on at the FBI during the months before the election, and how it affected the Times\\' coverage. https://t.co/n3sd6po3rc\\n9B) The FBI assumed HRC would win &amp; was paranoid that Trump would paint it as partisan.\\n\\nThus, the FBI threw cold water on the story a week before the election, resulting in the headline \"Investigating Donald Trump, FBI finds no clear link to Russia.\" \\nhttps://t.co/dzqEcui2MT\\n10A) @chrisinsilico, the #CambridgeAnalytica whistleblower, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/2U6f4fLvHb\\n10B) Wylie testified that Steve Bannon was extremely interested in using psychographic data to suppress voting, especially among minorities more likely to vote for Democrats. https://t.co/GsBhP7Sawj\\n11A) Michael Cohen was working on a Trump Tower Moscow deal until very close to Trump\\'s nomination. https://t.co/rUVVZMTJhe\\n11B) Cohen previously claimed the Trump Moscow Tower project was dropped in January 2016, but texts &amp; emails between Cohen and Felix Sater show it continued into the 2nd half of 2016.\\n\\nTrump at the time was claiming he had no ties to Russia. https://t.co/C61Y9cVg7u\\n12) So now you\\'re caught up on the double digit #TrumpRussia developments from Wed.\\n\\nNext question is, \"What can YOU do to help?\"\\n\\nStep 1 - Sign up at https://t.co/U6JcNSOxpL for \\'rapid response.\\'\\n\\nVolume of sign-ups (now 350k+) is a deterrent to Trump crossing our red lines. https://t.co/WJnrgE7vjB\\n13) Step 2 - Call your senators &amp;

But failed to expand the number of resettlement places as Home Sec or as PM.\\nShe ended automatic settlement for refugees after five years, deliberately leaving refugees uncertain whether they would eventually be kicked out. https://t.co/HGqPuE3fyd\\nShe introduced a new policy in 2014 that prevents some recognised refugees from getting British citizenship because of the way they entered the UK in the first place https://t.co/BirzfJX8tU\\nPerhaps her main legacy is the quiet revolution in immigration policy that is the hostile environment: citizen on citizen immigration checks. https://t.co/UKvAe21xos\\nOne of the most obvious direct effects of the hostile environment was the Windrush scandal, where legally resident BME people lost their jobs, health care and dignity. \\n\\nThat rests squarely on Theresa May’s shoulders.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/DZmGV7fBy3\\nThen there was the huge increase in citizenship stripping under Theresa May, much of which was later found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/NoUMmpO7Ri https://t.co/nQH6KfEy8r\\nHow about the thousands of “Skype families” created by her harsh new family immigration rules introduced in 2012? Children are forced abroad or separated from one of their parents by the £18,600 earnings rule.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/YPrzMba6eM\\nLet’s not forgot how discriminatory that rule is, because women, ethnic minorities and those outside London are less likely to earn enough to live with their loved ones.\\n\\nThat’s squarely on Theresa May’s shoulders as well.\\nWhile we’re on discrimination, the High Court recently found one of the key planks of Theresa May’s hostile environment, the “right to rent” policy, caused landlords to discriminate against ethnic minority tenants when they otherwise would not. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/rrwDPFcwbG\\nThe 2012 family immigration rules also included the cruel effective closure of the immigration route for parents, forcing British citizens to move abroad to look after their elderly parents https://t.co/2wfhesqfXq\\nThere’s also what I can only describe as plain spitefulness to migrants. She seemed to be obsessed. Take the “go home” vans, for example. https://t.co/oaGJCeASOR\\nOr the “deport first, appeal later” law. You can only appeal after you’ve been removed, making it far harder to fight your case. The Supreme Court found it to be implemented unlawfully.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/052C9w9AbC\\nOr the English language testing scandal.

Judge after judge has criticised the state of the law. Ordinary people simply cannot understand how the law affects them now. https://t.co/FhawMRoKcw\\nThe rules are such a mess now, due to changes in 2012, that an experienced immigration lawyer can barely get through an application for their own spouse.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/h8kmUHVfYb\\nShe introduced a cap on skilled migrants. That’s right, she stopped skilled migrants like doctors and IT specialists from coming to the UK even when they could not be recruited locally. \\n\\nNuts.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/wbBHtMIfFp\\nOne of her most lasting and damning legacies may be from forcing EU citizens to apply to the Home Office for permission to remain in the UK after Brexit, which will leave probably hundreds of thousands illegal after the deadline. https://t.co/ODaW3nPQ8a\\nThere was a huge increase in the number of EU citizens detained in the UK, due to Theresa May’s illegal policy of rounding up suspected homeless EU citizens https://t.co/Z3CbxhIbUG\\nEU citizens were also forced to complete additional paperwork to qualify for British citizenship from 2015 onwards. The added complexity caused many to be refused and loose the huge application fee. https://t.co/bEO2bF2S1Y\\nYet, despite all that, Theresa May never came close to meeting the net migration target she clung to. \\n\\nThe policies were never based on evidence.\\n\\nThey were never going to “work” on her terms. \\n\\nThe public was never going to be reassured.\\n\\nThey were little more than spite.\\nFinally, I leave you with The Cat.

There are two places in the Constitution where the President is forbidden from receiving emoluments. From receiving money for his position as, say, owner of a hotel, golf course, or facility.\\n6. The best known one, strangely enough, is the \"foreign emoluments\" clause. The media (remember them? Think \"emails\".) mostly likes to talk about this one. It\\'s muddy.\\n7. It provides that no member of our federal government, implicitly including the President, may take any money \"of any  kind whatever\" for himself from any \"King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\\n8.

This is the second paragraph down from where it says that only a natural born citizen can be President. The paragraph after the one that says if the President dies the Vice President takes over.\\n9. People, I have seen this referred to by our media (remember the media? Think \"emails.\" Yeah, them.) \\nI have seen this paragraph referred to as a \"technicality.\"\\n10. If it\\'s a technicality that the President has to be over 35 years old and a natural born citizen, if it\\'s a technicality that the Vice President is second in line, then it\\'s a technicality that he can\\'t rent golf carts to the Secret Service.\\n11. It is *NOT* a technicality. It is a FUNDAMENTAL PROVISION OF OUR CONSTITUTION.\\nTHE PRESIDENT IS FORBIDDEN FROM SELLING OR RENTING GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT or from any state. It absolutely could not be any plainer.\\n12. On 116 occasions, as of this writing, the President* has taken the Secret Service to his private properties and sold and rented goods to them. \\nThis is ABSOLUTELY, EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN under our Constitution. https://t.co/0Jn07RlxvI\\n13. Yes, I care that the Republicoup sold our country to Vladimir Putin for a bowl of pottage. I care a lot.\\nBut meanwhile, the crookedest man in America is scamming your money every weekend.\\nAnd the rules say he can\\'t.\\n14. It doesn\\'t say, \"he can trade his salary for all he can steal from the treasury.\"\\nHe doesn\\'t have to keep his salary. We have to pay it to him.\\nAnd whether he keeps it or not, HE CAN\\'T SELL OR RENT SHIT TO ANY AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL OR ANY STATE GOVERNMENT.\\n15. The language of the Constitution is as plain as the everyday language I use in my tweets. Old words are as meaningful as new ones.\\nNo wages, rents, fees, returns from property or position - owning a golf course is a \"position.\"\\n16. Two critical, Constitutionally provided entities are screwing you 7 days of every week, and have been since January 20th, 2017.\\nThe United States Congress, and the (allegedly) Free Press.\\n17. The rat bastard rented space in Trump Tower to the Secret Service while he was still President-Elect. So they could guard him and the First Bimbo. And that was legal. Nothing says the President-Elect can\\'t scam money out of the treasury.\\n18. But the minute he fouled that Bible with his filthy hand and took the Oath of Office he was in violation of the Constitution he just swore to uphold.\\n19. If our vaunted Checks and Balances worked - if the Republicoup Congress wasn\\'t corrupt and complicit - they would have begun Impeachment proceedings the following Monday.\\n20. Yes, literally.\\nSay they found incontrovertible proof on Saturday that Donald Trump was born in Kenya.

Do you want to talk about Mitchfest? Do you want to talk about the threats, and the intimidation, and the no-platforming of feminist women? No, you really don\\'t do you?\\n2. \"Blah blah, ppl who oppose gender ideology only oppose it because they believe in the natural god-given roles imposed by patriarchy and this all totally makes sense of the radical feminist critique I\\'m ignoring here because yeah they\\'re just like the Pope.\" https://t.co/rUz7ettUWa\\n3a. This is such a sneaky slippery mess.... The Pope thinks people can\\'t choose their *gender* because it falsifies the reality of *sex* because conservatives think that sex=gender, and both are divinely ordained. There is whole load of other people out there who think you can\\'t https://t.co/AtY3ozSfMt\\nchoose you sex (not your gender), and it has fuck all to do with the \"divinely mandated natural distinction between the sexes.\" Our crackpot theory is called \\'mammals are sexually dimorphic because that\\'s the evolved mechanism which creates variation, fitness, and the possibility\\nof natural trait selection in lifeforms more complex than worms.\\' Bonkers. Everyone who is any way compelled by the claims of evolution is now in league with the Catholic Church. Well, that is a turn up for the historical books. \\n\\nThis is so fucking disingenuous I just URGHHHHHH.\\nb. It\\'s worth nothing here also that while she\\'s claiming that \\'gender theorists\\' recognise that gender is not determined by sex (assigned at birth bullshit bullshit)... she is simultaneously refusing to acknowledge that there are people - us - who think sex exists and in no way\\nshould determine gender. There is this conceptual black hole in the genderists thinking in which they cannot acknowledge that sex could exist without gender, and which relies on maintaining that to abolish gender we must abolish sex... which is to say, they are the exact mirror\\nimage of the \\'conservative\\' position they purportedly oppose (sex=gender), and their thought *depends* on erasing, or misconstruing, the gender critical position (sex =/= gender).\\n4. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. \\n\\nThis isn\\'t even disingenuous. It\\'s just a flat-out fucking lie.\\n\\nGo and talk to the detransitioners Judy and ask if this feels nothing like indoctrination. Or try not agreeing, and then tell me it\\'s just a form of freedom. https://t.co/Y5JdcqafX7\\n5. This is not entirely egregious, but won\\'t acknowledge that the next move made will, by abolishing sex, actually erase the distinction it purports to recognise here.\\n\\nBonus mandatory faux-sophisticate implication that \\'ppl who think sex exists are a bit simple aren\\'t they?\\' https://t.co/fZCpzZ7ygr\\n6. What I want to point to here is the constant error that is made by conflating the claim that sex does not necessarily determine gender, and the claim that sex does not historically determine gender. \\n\\nBeauvoir, along with *all* feminists, believes that sex-role are not https://t.co/DxAPKz4VF6\\na *necessary* feature of sex (we can talk about bimodal personality distributions, but the point is, that does not change the fact that the vast majority of gendering is social construction). That does not mean that the way gender has been constructed in patriarchy has *nothing*\\nto do with sex, and that we can just pretend that sex doesn\\'t exist and is socially irrelevant, because under these conditions, its fucking relevant. If you want to abolish sex-based oppression, you actually need to abolish sex-based oppression, not just play make-believe.\\n7. Okay, so now get to the intersex appropriation. I\\'ll spare you most of this, you all know the drill...\\n\\nBut it\\'s kind of interesting that she notes that although in this case sex is not a given, it is determined inside a biological framework... and then asks, what framework https://t.co/179S6RyZVx\\nis used to make that determination? Um. You just said. A biological one.\\n\\nThat is, a framework that aims to determine whether an individual has gone down the developmental pathway which would make them a member of the sperm-making class or the ova-making class. \\n\\nAnd no one is\\nsuggesting that that should lead to IGM. And to leverage the horror of historic IGM in order to support your ideology that sex is in some sense vastly indeterminate is morally egregious instrumentalization.\\n8. This is a totally classic Judy sleight-of-hand. At this point sex and gender start being run together and it\\'s implied they are both historically determined in the same kind of way. And viola! The determination of sex becomes both \\'constructed\\' and an \\'existential choice.\\' https://t.co/LkShghln6a\\n9. More fantastical bullshit about how gender ideology is a form of freedom and no one is imposing their views on anyone. \\n\\nGo and talk to the young women in universities right now who don\\'t agree with this crap and find out how much freedom they feel like they have. Hypocrite. https://t.co/CbZuzbE6VV\\n10. Back to erasing feminists and claiming anyone who opposes this is a conservative Christian. That\\'s right Judy, radical lesbian feminists are really pro-life and think homosexuality is a sin. We have no problem with how people perform their gender. It just doesn\\'t change sex. https://t.co/gVX3aDNQh5\\n11. No, we have no problem with teaching people about the diversity of how people can live a \\'spectrum of gendered lives.\\' We have a problem with teaching people that that means they are in the wrong body and their bodies need to be changed to match their \\'gender.\\' We have a https://t.co/uIy1VB4S4T\\na problem with spreading a thought system which leads gender non conforming kids into a lifetime of possibly unnecessary medicalization. And we have a problem with essentialising gender, which you should also have, if you had a shred of intellectual honesty left in you.\\n12.

       " 'hilo 359': '1. I am about to blow your minds with this thread. It is massive. You will want to pay VERY close attention. The Senate Intelligence Committee released a lot of documents last week and I touched upon this but didn\\'t put two and two together until now.\\n2. There is a lawsuit ongoing right now in the UK. Orbis and Steele are being sued by Aleksej Gubarev, Webzilla, and XBT based off of memos in the dossier.\\n3. We know that McCain received the dossier via David Kramer back in November of 2016, and then he handed it over to the FBI. I just chose a random article to have it out of his own mouth.  https://t.co/2slRiQDBaB https://t.co/auBJZnbwV0\\n4. We know that during this time, he met with Sir Andrew Wood (former UK diplomat) to receive it. https://t.co/bGdNPWmzaR The \"Senator\" referenced, is John McCain. https://t.co/PGoEFYQz2J\\n5. So we know that McCain was involved with Fusion GPS and Steele/Orbis for what we will now call the \"pre-election\" dossier. But, although alluded to several times, we also now have in our possession a memo written by Steele in DECEMBER. AFTER the election.\\n6. When the Senate released their docs the other day, inside was a full copy of the dossier, including the December memo, as well as some of the responses written by Orbis/Steele in the lawsuit. Let\\'s first examine the Memo. My gosh hold on to your hats folks...\\n7. Here is the memo. This memo basically states, that Cohen, in Prague, made cash payments to Russian FSB connected hackers to target the DNC and other connected players. https://t.co/i7IDTNgLpJ\\n8. In this part here, they cover \"Guccifer 2.0\". https://t.co/oCWUMlPveA\\n9. In this part, they cover the phishing and malware that the establishment contends targeted members of the DNC and Podesta: https://t.co/N7rvtNfmR3\\n10. The problem?? MICHAEL COHEN HAS NEVER BEEN TO PRAGUE. It was debunked back after the dossier was released, when Cohen provided his passport, and receipts to prove he wasn\\'t in Prague at the time of this report, or EVER. https://t.co/5zsoV8gYfN https://t.co/kGbcZ3Uikk\\n11. We all scratched our heads a few weeks ago, in mid April, when the \"Cohen in Prague\" story was trotted out again in front of the media. Why would they be bringing this up again, with such fervor? Oh I know why! Part II: https://t.co/SgDYquc2tU\\n12. The media was trying to get in front of this story, because of the massive implications it has. We learn in this lawsuit (included in what the Senate Intel Committee dropped) that McCain received this memo, along with a SENIOR LEVEL UK INTELLIGENCE official.\\n13. Lets go through the lawsuit together, and I will tie everything up in a moment. Kramer asked that McCain be briefed with anything further in re: to Russian interference in the election. https://t.co/GHcdLbXXQK\\n14. This entire page needs to be read- remember this is Orbis/Steele answering. It states here the Dec memo was given to McCain through Fusion, and then Kramer, encrypted- three hands to get this to him-- https://t.co/qau930k1Fa\\n15. \"We had to send this along because it was important. They should have known they shouldn\\'t publish it or share it\" https://t.co/JiEmobLnAw\\n16. Here, they basically say that Fusion should have known not to disperse the December memo under a previous NDA (aka- Fusion may have leaked it) https://t.co/Ip6EiefgJo\\n17. \"We were providing the December memo to McCain and Kramer under their official capacity- that is how it was presented to us\" https://t.co/9x7N5ouMoK\\n18. This is interesting, because it states that this intelligence was delivered to Steele without him even asking for it. The question? Who brought it to him. I would be speculating if I answered that question, so I am going to wait until the end to do that. https://t.co/iKEfAgENIL\\n19. And finally, the big enchilada, they couldn\\'t even PROVE the contents of the memo were true! So again, we have unverified information, which was provided to McCain and Kramer through FusionGPS in December, and was then used for something amazing. LOOK AT THIS. https://t.co/UCRXFPLsLL\\n20. Remember the contents of the memo? Russian and \"Romanian\" hacking financed by Cohen? Is it sheer coincidence that Crowdstrike happened to come out in December with their \"proof\" that Russia did the hacking, along with some of the language found in this memo?\\n21. Well it did. Take a look. https://t.co/MQr8DYgrPl https://t.co/ZCEsBWueER\\n22. It appears that Crowdstrike obtained this memo, either via Fusion GPS (as insinuated in the lawsuit, by Orbis) or via McCain, and then used this memo as the foundation for the charges that \"Russia hacked the DNC\".https://t.co/Uf6iqp4o5g https://t.co/Bohz3AhreV\\n23. As a matter of fact, not two weeks later, the official intelligence report concluding the Russian hacking was released. Was it all based on this unverified, now provably false, intelligence memo which was handed to Steele unprovoked?\\n\\nhttps://t.co/GyMLHBx6Tl\\n24. One more: https://t.co/HuOCejvpj1 https://t.co/Pi8KQrYfk0\\n25. So it appears, that select folks in the IC, who had used the unverified dossier already to obtain FISA warrants, etc, via Fusion and McCain/Kramer, used this bogus December memo as the proof that the hacking was done by Russia, and then someone passed it on to Crowdstrike...\\n26.

       " 'hilo 360': \"Quick, brief refresher on my understanding of how we got here: \\n\\n1. During 2016 primaries, Trump knows Obama/HRC did lots of sweet under the table deals with Russians/Iranians.  To troll them, he starts bragging how he's going to be Putin's BFF once he's elected.\\n2. Hillary &amp; her team hatch a dirty trick to play on Trump: they'll hire an political communications shop named FUSION GPS to create what will be passed off as a collection of intelligence reports 'proving' Trump &amp; his campaign team are in the pocket of the Russians.\\n3. A Fusion GPS team made up of Glenn Simpson, Nellie Ohr, Mary Jacoby [Simpson's spouse] and former MI6 spy Christopher Steele, begins producing the fiction that later becomes known as 'the Steele dossier'.\\n4. In these fake intel report summaries, the Fusion team center their creative writing around several people involved in Trump's campaign: Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\\n5. The best part of this dirty trick is the willing participation of many Obama holdover/Hillary sycophants sprinkled throughout the federal LEO/IC agencies only too willing to help launder this dossier &amp; pretend it's an intel product, not fiction from a political comms shop.\\n6. Simultaneously the dossier begins to have key details in it leaked to media allies such as David Corn of Mother Jones, strategic leaks that immediately place Carter Page and Paul Manafort under suspicion of being Russian agents.\\n7. While these strategic leaks are happening, people such as Sen. John McCain and Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie are being used to 'discover' the dossier &amp; bring it to the attention of the FBI, as well as to the attention of the Hillary campaign itself.\\n8. Thanks to the laundering of the dossier, the HRC campaign now has plausible deniability. Fed LEO/IC agencies are 'finding' the dossier on their own [wink wink!] &amp; reporters are 'finding' gov't sources who are 'independently' verifying the dossier by leaking it to them [wink!]\\n9. While that was going on, to give the Steele Dossier more credibility, Obama/Hillary sycophants inside the LEO/IC began actually SENDING spies to try to entrap Trump campaign staff. Carter Page, G. Papadopoulos &amp; others are targeted for fake 'recruitment' by 'Russians'.\\n10. While Page &amp; Papadopoulos are being set up by IC spies trying to entrap them, the plotters inside the LEO/IC agencies go to the FISA Court &amp; draw up a warrant to spy on Carter Page using the fake dossier as intel product. Reportedly, 1st warrant attempt is denied.\\n11. But they persisted! A subsequent warrant attempt on Page is granted. The plotters now have legal authority to begin intercepting all of the Trump campaign's electronic comms [EC's].\\n12. The two pronged approach appears to be paying off. They have strategic leaks in the media keeping Trump's campaign under constant suspicion of being a Russian subsidiary while fed. IC/LEO agents are furiously spying on them trying to find dirt to derail Trump's candidacy.\\n13.  AND IT DIDN'T MATTER. Hillary runs an inept campaign, Trump wins anyway. \\n\\nNow the real fun starts. https://t.co/Fmh8Z2eclm\\n14. Every action taken by the plotters prior to election day 2016 was based on Hillary winning. The Steele dossier was NEVER supposed to be thoroughly examined. It's careful laundering was to provide an excuse for leaks &amp; investigations. It CAN'T stand up to scrutiny.\\n15. So after this election disaster, the plotters now have to do two things: \\n\\na.  they have to keep HIDING their investigation into the Trump campaign [which they'd concealed from Congressional oversight] so they can find something to impeach him with.\\n16. and while doing that they must also\\n\\nb. they have to hide the real facts about where the Steele dossier came from and who paid for it.\\n17. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PLOTTERS, Democrats in Congress like Jerrold Nadler and Elijah Cummings were VERY VERY ANGRY at then-FBI Director James Comey for reopening the Clinton Email investigation after the Weiner laptop was discovered with 300,000 new HRC-related emails on it. https://t.co/LKRsQmiP6L\\n18. See, top Dems in Congress like Cummings &amp; Nadler were *convinced* Comey's reopening of that HRC email investigation played a huge part in Hillary's losing the election to Trump. \\n\\nSo they DEMAND an investigation by the DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into this.\\n19.  On Jan. 12, 2017, DOJ IG Horowitz GRANTS DEMOCRATS WHAT THEY WANTED.  He announces a review of the DOJ/FBI's handling of matters prior to the 2016 Presidential election [which includes the Hillary Email investigation]. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/U2IN69fy9k https://t.co/OT7W2ySMl5\\n20. During the course of his review of the investigations/actions the DOJ/FBI was engaged in leading up to the 2016 election, here's what Horowitz discovers: \\n\\nDespite the best efforts of the plotters to hide it, he discovers the truth about the Steele dossier.\\n21. HOROWITZ is the one who discovers the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the creation of the Steele dossier by tracking the funding for it through the law firm Perkins Coie.\\n22. While tracing the origins of the Steele Dossier &amp; how it was laundered through fed. LEO/IC agents misrepresenting it - even in FISA warrants! - Horowitz *also* happens upon the text messages on the official FBI phones of the lead agent in 'Crossfire Hurricane': Peter Strzok.\\n23. While tracking down the origins/laundering of the bogus Steele Dossier, &amp; perusing the unbelievably juvenile text messages of Strzok/Page, Horowitz &amp; his team of investigators also uncover a plethora of strategic leaking by Andrew McCabe, among others.\\n24. So here's what Horowitz has been tipping Congress off to since October 2017, when he first began rolling out all the evidence of what he'd found since he began his investigation on Jan 12, 2017:\\n25. \\n\\na. Bogus Steele dossier &amp; how it was created, paid for, laundered\\nb. Abuse of the FISA court system to start investigations based on it\\nc. Strategic leaks in media to 'back up' the dossier by top FBI/DOJ officials\\nd. Alteration of official DOJ/FBI records\\n26. Horowitz released his report on McCabe first, which led to McCabe's being terminated. Several weeks ago he released the MYE report on Clinton Democrats were so hot to get that referred 5 people to the FBI OPR for pro-Clinton bias.\\n\\nUp next? The FISA Abuse/Trump Spying report\\n27. This is how we've arrived to where we are today: with Peter Strzok &amp; Lisa Page being the first of a phalanx of plotters who are going to be subpoenaed to testify before Congress about their roles in this plot to undermine a presidential electoin &amp; then targeting a President.\\n28. And there you have it. How a work of fiction, that placed a man in Prague who's never been to Prague, ended up being used to smear a Presidential candidate in the media, then to start *legal* spying on him &amp; his associates using fed. LEO/IC agencies.\\n\\n/end\",\n",
       " 'hilo 361': 'Let\\'s just NAIL THIS shall we?   Does the UK get value for money from the EU?\\n\\n\"We pay in more than we get back\" cry the Brexiteers... \\n\\n\"the UK could lose one hundred billion pounds from the economy and a million unemployed\" replies the CBI.   \\n\\nSo lets take a look at the FACTs https://t.co/pcSsErL20k\\n2/ CASH IN AND CASH OUT\\nAccording to Page 40 of Her Majesties Treasury report at December 2015 entitled “European Union Finances 2015”, the UKs contribution to the European Union (our ‘membership fee’) that Brexiteers tell us we could *save* and spend on building new hospitals,\\n3/ schools and the like is £12.36 billion in 2015.  *This figure is calculated as a percentage of Gross National Income, or GNI.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom received an ‘instant rebate’ of £4.86 billion. (not sent to the EU)\\n4/  This is calculated before we make any payment at all which means that the cash amount that we sent to Brussels last year was just £7.5 billion.   To put this in perspective, the Department for Communities and Local Government statistical dataset of December 3rd 2015,\\n5/  there are 27.4 million households in the UK.\\n\\nThe UK cash contribution therefore is £273 per household per year, or using an average of 2.34 people per household (DCLG figures) £116.97 per person.\\n\\nSo starting with £7.5 billion, lets look at some of what we get back:\\n6/ UK Farmers receive direct payments of just under £4 billion through the Common Agricultural Policy and Agriculture funding.\\n\\nThe European Social Fund which support charities across the UK with a variety of grants, and the UK Cohesion Fund that funds various infrastructure\\n7/ developments in the UK contribute around £1.96 billion (total of £11.8bn between 2014 and 2020).\\n\\nAnd a further £108 million is paid back to the UK in grants towards a number of other projects.\\n8/ So from the £7.5bn we pay, we get back around £6bn in direct cash payments, leaving a net cash difference of £1.5 billion per year.\\n9/ EU MEMBERSHIP EFFECT ON UK GDP\\nOf course, as EU members we are able to access the European Single Market which means we are able to sell unlimited products, and services made in the UK totally free of tariffs and duties.\\n10/ This means that the UK can import parts and raw materials relatively cheaply keep cost of production low and it also means that UK made goods are competitively priced in the largest bloc of customers on the planet.\\n11/ Combined, this makes the UK a great destination for UK and foreign manufacturers to invest and create British jobs, and help build the UK economy.   Without this unlimited free trade, it is guaranteed that investment in the UK economy would slow down.\\n12/ I’ve looked at some of the contributors to UK GDP.  I have made some assumptions that you should be aware of:  Firstly, the figures here are not the TOTAL contribution to the UK economy of each sector, but I have pared it back substantially and am only including the portion\\n13/  of GDP that is related to our EU membership.   For example, it is likely that cars will still be made in the UK, but not as many as today if we leave.\\n14/ Automotive sector: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and KPMG carried out extensive analysis of the UKs automotive sector.  Their conclusions from the final report entitled “An economic assessment of the UKs automotive industry with the European Union” are\\n15/ are that over 700,000 people in Britain are employed in the automotive sector, and the total contribution to the UK economy is in excess of £60 billion in 2013/14.  One example is Nissan in Sunderland who build 500,000 cars per year only sell 19% of their production in the UK\\n16/ For the contribution to the UK economy from the EU, I’ve deducted just 40% from the total GDP contribution here:\\n\\nThe UK automotive sector makes cars in the UK for the EU £36.3 billion per year.\\n17/ According to the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) report in conjunction with Deloittes, inward travel on business from other EU countries £0.95bn per year. (not tourists, just business).\\n18/ The UK Agri-Food sector employs over 3.5 million people in the UK and contributes over £103 billion in GVA to the UK economy in 2013.  Of this a significant proportion is exported all around the globe – I have used a figure here of £70.15bn per year.\\n19/ TheCityUK report “A practitioners guide to Brexit: exploring its consequences and alternatives to EU membership suggests that the UK financial and related services sector employs 2.2m people in the UK and of a total GDP contribution to UK GDP of £66bn in 2014/15.\\n20/ Exports to other EU countries from this sector were far in excess of the £19.7bn per year figure I am using.\\n\\nJust between those 4 sectors UK GDP is enhanced by £127.1 billion each year.\\n21/ Remembering that our net cash contribution to the EU was just £1.5 billion, and the UK economy benefits from just those four sectors by £127.1 billion, you would think that was already a pretty good deal eh?\\n\\nHowever, the benefits continue...\\n22/ FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT\\nAs a result of the UKs membership of the EU, we hold over one trillion pounds of money in UK bank deposits from the other 27 EU countries – it is impossible to think that they would leave all that here if we vote to Leave.\\n23/ Lets assume that we lost just 17% of that figure – that would be a loss of £170 billion out of the UK banking sector (around half the amount that UK Government bailed out the banks back in 2009).\\n24/ By 2014, the UK received £1,065 billion of foreign investment into the UK economy from countries all around the world.  A large portion of this is to build products in the UK to sell tariff free into the EU.\\n25/ A HUGE benefit to the UK of remaining members of the EU.  Of course we would not lose all that investment, but lets say that other EU countries withheld 40% their investment from the UK and put that money to use elsewhere in the EU.....  continued in next thread.....\\n26/ that would be loss of around £170.1 billion out of the UK economy.   If other countries around the world reduced their inward investment into the UK by 25%, that is further loss to the UK economy of another £150 billion.\\n27/ So the UK pays net £1.5 billion a year and we get back at least £127.1 billion into GDP from trade, and a further £320.1 billion in EU related FDI…. creating UK jobs.\\n\\nSo far that’s an annual benefit to the UK economy overall of £128.6 billion.\\n28/28 And Brexiteers continue to cry about our \\'membership fee\\'?

Trump,” which outlined a strategy whereby Mueller could refer his obstruction findings to Congress\\n5) Notably, two of the authors of the Brookings report were later retained by Rep. Jerry Nadler, House Judiciary Committee Chairman, on a consulting basis as special oversight counsels to the Democrat Majority Staff.\\n6) It was initially believed that the primary focus of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation centered around allegations of collusion, however, the release of Mueller’s report makes clear that substantial resources were dedicated to investigating potential obstruction charges.\\n7) The Mueller report stated that in regards to obstruction, several statutes could apply - including 1503 and 1505 - but the special counsel chose to focus primarily on Section 1512.\\n\\nMueller’s report dedicates a full section to defending the use of Section 1512.\\n8) Among the first mentions suggesting the use of Section 1512 was a June 2, 2017 article by the website Lawfare.\\n\\nThe article was written approximately two weeks after Mueller was first appointed as special counsel.\\nhttps://t.co/fbwQPpuKZZ\\n9) Wittes, himself a Senior Fellow at Brookings, was also the author of an article in October 2016 that discussed the need for an “insurance policy,” which according to Wittes was a “cross-ideological network of lawyers and philanthropists” dedicated to fighting Trump in court.\\n10) It wasn’t just Lawfare that had focused its attention on Section 1512.\\n\\nThe Brookings report, which was brought to my attention and initially covered in an article by @Joestradamus91, made Section 1512 a primary focus from an early start.\\nhttps://t.co/IsGdMlCtrt\\n11) It is unclear whether the Brookings Institute report was part of this effort suggested by Wittes, who is also a Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution.\\n12) Brookings produced its first 108 page report, authored by Barry Berke, Noah Bookbinder and Norman Eisen on Oct. 10, 2017.\\n\\nThey followed up with a 177 page 2nd Edition on Aug. 22, 2018 which also came with a lengthy 200 page appendix.\\nhttps://t.co/M46I41UnRh\\n13) In the 2nd Edition, the Brookings report dedicated an entire section solely to exploring the use of Section 1512—and as they note in their report, they did so specifically because 1512 could be applied towards “obstruction” of potential and possible future proceedings.\\n14) On page 148, the Brookings report discusses the issue of referring the Mueller report directly to Congress: https://t.co/47JPrXGKGs\\n15) Although the Brookings report strives to make its case regarding congressional referral, at each turn it is forced to acknowledge that any referral option would be subject to the authority and oversight of then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\\n16) Another problem exists.\\n\\n@realDonaldTrump was told on three separate occasions by Dir Comey that he was not personally under investigation by the FBI.\\n\\nTherefore, Trump could not obstruct an investigation of himself if he didn\\'t know there was an investigation to begin with.\\n17) Regarding claims that President Trump might have obstructed an investigation into individuals other than himself, there would need to be a rationalization against presidential pardon authority.\\n18) On Feb. 12, 2019, Nadler announced that two of the Brookings report authors, Eisen and Berke, had been retained as special oversight counsels to the Democrat Majority Staff.\\n\\nThey were appointed in advance of the April 18 release of the Mueller report.\\nhttps://t.co/GWnWRfGJ2w\\n19) It appears that Nadler had intended for Eisen and Burke to lead a hoped-for May 2 questioning of AG Barr personally.\\n\\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) commented on Barr’s absence and Berke\\'s &amp; Eisen\\'s planned involvement during an impromptu press conference on May 2: https://t.co/TlFAzCJmmA\\n20) Section 1512 is a rather obscure statute, a fact inadvertently highlighted in two separate letters sent by President Trump’s lawyers to SC Mueller.\\n\\nSection 1505, the standard for obstruction, is mentioned in the letters 39 times. Section 1512 is not mentioned once.\\n21) But apparently, there was one individual who had foreseen its possible use.\\n\\nOn June 8, 2018, William Barr, now the Attorney General but then a lawyer in private practice, sent a lengthy memo to DAG Rosenstein and AAG Steve Engel.\\nhttps://t.co/DXqM7uz4WO\\n22) Barr’s memo noted “It appears Mueller\\'s team is investigating a possible case of \"obstruction\" by the President.\\n\\nUnlike the president’s lawyers, Barr predicted the use of Section 1512, noting, “It appears Mueller is relying on 18 U.S.C. § 1512.\\n23) This quiet battle between Mueller and Barr over the use of Section 1512 was first highlighted in an excellent article by Will Chamberlain of Human Events.\\nhttps://t.co/KPUz3cPbk6\\n24) Barr appeared alarmed by the liberal application of Section 1512, observing that “any discretionary act by a President that influences a proceeding can become the subject of a criminal grand jury investigation, probing whether the President acted with an improper motive.”\\n25) Barr noted the spiralling outcomes that could come from use of the statute:\\n\\n“Simply by giving direction on a case, or class of cases, an official opens himself to the charge that he has acted with an \"improper\" motive and thus becomes subject to a criminal investigation.”\\n26) Mueller ultimately failed to provide a determination on obstruction directly, leaving the decision up to AG Barr, who along with then-Deputy AG Rosenstein, ruled that there was no obstruction by the president.\\n27) Barr said that he and Rosenstein did not agree with much of the legal analysis contained in the report and felt it represented the “views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law.”\\n28) Barr concluded:\\n\\n“The report itself points out that one of the likely motivations here was the president’s frustration with Comey saying something publicly and saying a different thing privately, and refusing to correct the record.”\\n\\n/End',\n",
       " 'hilo 363': 'AMERICA, WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE.\\n \\nYesterday, as Trump was ranting about “shithole countries,” I was in a county courthouse in Georgia looking at a death certificate for a black man who died in 1930. I watched the courthouse employees’ faces... 1/\\nclosely as they read the cause of death “Unlawful act.” Their confused looks confirmed what I suspected; they had never seen such a vague description listed as a cause of death. They clearly did not know about the incident that occurred there 88 years before, even though it 2/\\nhad been the focus of national news for weeks back in 1930. “It was a lynching” I explained, pointing to the word scribbled in parenthesis on the document. I had them pull another death certificate; this one for a white 16 year-old girl who had died one day prior to the man.  3/\\nHer cause of death was listed as “Murder.” The man was accused of raping &amp; murdering the girl the day before. He had fled into the woods after locals spotted him on the road not far away from her body. The sheriff arrived quickly &amp; immediately called for assistance from... 4/\\nneighboring law enforcement agencies. They began tracking him as soon as dogs arrived; first, along a creek through the woods, then across fields &amp; through more woods. It continued for eighteen hours, with more &amp; more men joining in from other counties, until the track ended 5/\\nat a cabin nearly 20 miles away. The posse, which had grown to nearly one thousand by that time, quickly surrounded the house. The owner told the sheriff that the suspect was not there. However, when the sheriff &amp; two deputies searched it, they discovered him hiding in the 6/\\nkitchen. The posse waited restlessly outside as the sheriff questioned the suspect. The restlessness quickly transformed the men from a posse into a mob. They rushed into the cabin &amp; grabbed the owner, intending to “teach him a lesson” for sheltering the suspect. Fortunately 7/\\nthe sheriff was able to calm them down. Unfortunately, their focus turned to the suspect. The heavily armed mob told the sheriff that he could maintain custody of the suspect, but instead of the county jail, they would be taking him to where the girl’s body was found. He was 8/\\nordered to follow a truck loaded with 15 armed men. Another 75 to 100 cars &amp; trucks followed closely behind the sheriff. When the caravan reached the city limits, the sheriff – knowing that the mob likely intended to lynch his suspect – attempted to get away when the lead... 9/\\ntruck made a turn. Dozens of shots were fired, disabling the sheriff\\'s car. The sheriff, deputies &amp; suspect were forced into another vehicle &amp; transported to mob’s intended destination. Upon arrival, the suspect was chained to a tree. A crowd of more than a thousand, ... 10/\\nincluding women &amp; children, watched as his fingers and toes were removed, “joint by joint.” A pole was jabbed into his mouth when he began to scream. It was removed only long enough to pull his teeth with pliers. More torture, to gruesome to describe, took place. In total, 11/\\nit lasted for more than an hour. He was still alive when the mob piled sticks &amp; logs under him, poured gas on &amp; ignited the fire. Several men fired their weapons at pointblank range. The body was left there for the day. Thousands of people “rode out to see the spectacle.” 12/\\nTwelve hours later, at sunset, the sheriff &amp; deputies removed &amp; buried the body. Details of the lynching were published in America’s newspapers from coast to coast. Despite an investigation, which included convening a grand jury, no one was ever charged. The reason I ... 13/\\ndecided to tweet about this is because of what happened next… not back in 1930, but YESTERDAY, both in that Georgia courthouse and in the White House. After I concluded providing them with the details, one employee nodded approvingly, “They knew how to 14/\\nhandle things back then.” “Good for them,” said another. The 1st began to expound on their opinion; \"You know, it\\'s about damn time we stopped being afraid to-\" when a black women walked into the office. The employee cheerfully greeted the lady with familiarity \"Hey, Betty.\" 15/\\nI watched as they exchanged pleasantries. The employees\\' tones &amp; demeanor had completely changed. It was both astonishing &amp; disturbing. It was as if I was watching a performance, done for an audience of one; Betty. I had the urge to shout, \"Don\\'t believe it Betty! It\\'s just 16/\\nan act! RUN!\" But of course I just stood there, for just long enough to not seem rude. Having concluded my business, I thanked them &amp; left. I started the car &amp; by habit, turned on the radio just in time to hear about Trump’s “shithole” remarks. I cringed. There was no doubt 17/\\nin my mind where the “It’s about damn time we stopped being afraid to-” remark was headed had the black lady not walked in at that time. I had heard that tone &amp; seen that sneer too many times before. Like when I was 9 years-old, &amp; a neighbor jubilantly exclaimed \"Somebody - 18/\\nfinally killed that nigger!\" The \\'somebody\\' he was referring to turned out to be James Earl Ray &amp; the \\'nigger\\' was Martin Luther King Jr. That was the day, the exact minute, when I realized how truly evil racism was. Yes, I had seen news stories showing protesters being - 19/\\nknocked down with fire hoses, attacked by dogs &amp; beat with clubs, but that was on TV, somewhere else far away. Seeing Farmer Jekyll transform into the demented Farmer Hyde right in front of me was traumatic. It scared the hell out of me &amp; I never forgot it. I never - 20/\\nrespected him again. I saw &amp; heard that same deep hatred in that courthouse yesterday and I felt that same sickness gnawing at my soul as it did on that terrible day in 1968. Listening to the news about Trump on the way home, I recalled other racist things he has said &amp; done. 21/\\nI also remembered how, during Obama\\'s presidency, Republicans had made absurd &amp; baseless claims that Obama was not only not a Christian; he was a Muslim &amp; a racist, intent on destroying America by dividing us. And look at those same Republicans today; practically worshiping 22/\\na pathetic excuse for a man who is doing exactly what they falsely accused Obama of doing. People like those I saw yesterday, who make up Trump’s base, key off of every hateful ignorant word Trump spits out, whether it’s through his foul mouth or by applying his pudgy little 23/\\nfingers to a keypad. And all it would take to send them into an uncontrollable rage is for Donald Trump to say something just as their inner hatred hits the boiling point. Donald Trump personifies everything that is WRONG with America today. He is greedy. He is a misogynist. 24/\\nDonald Trump is a bigot. He is a hypocrite, both religiously &amp; patriotically.

In total, Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, $168,000 from this payment was paid to Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, and used by them to produce the dossier.\\nhttps://t.co/9KyQek6QXU\\n8. June 2016, after DNC website hack, Fusion GPS hired Orbis to look into Russian connections. The investigation was undertaken by Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele, retired British MI6 officer with expertise in Russian matters.\\n9. He described the finding seriously troubling evidence that he decided to share it with the FBI in July 2016, without permission of Fusion GPS. Steele delivered his report as a series of two- or three-page memos, starting in June 2016 and continuing through December.\\n10. He continued his investigation even after the Democratic client stopped paying for it following Trump\\'s election. In October 2016, Steele compiled 33 pages and passed his findings to a reporter from Mother Jones magazine.\\nhttps://t.co/D2NgxeMw09\\n11. Shortly after presidential election, John McCain met with former British ambassador to Moscow Andrew Wood who vouched for Steele\\'s professionalism and integrity.\\n12. McCain obtained the dossier and took it directly to James Comey on December 9, 2016. Note, some in FBI already knew about the dossier since Steele had decided to share it with them. \\nhttps://t.co/mO9CSH9wep\\n13. We also know that The FBI trusted Steele enough to consider paying him, but ended up not doing so in the end. Steele was familiar to the FBI, they had hired him to help a U.S. inquiry into alleged corruption in the world soccer organization FIFA. \\nhttps://t.co/SNJnSrodTK\\n14. January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump included allegations that Russian operatives possess compromising personal and financial information about Trump.\\n15. Following the CNN report, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier that it said was the basis of the briefing, including unverified claims that Russian operatives had collected \"embarrassing material\" involving Trump that could be used to blackmail him.\\n16. January 2017, Comey testified to Congress confirming Russian interference in 2016 election and confirmed ongoing investigation although he refused to comment on the Trump organization.\\n17. In March 2017 Comey finally confirmed that FBI was investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia and refuted Trump’s allegation that Obama administration that Obama Govt wiretapped him.\\nhttps://t.co/rNyO3L5jlv\\n18. Trump\\'s dismissal of Comey on came on May 9, 2017 after Deputy attorney general Rosenstein\\'s memorandum said that the \"reputation and credibility\" of the FBI had been damaged under Comey\\'s tenure.\\n19. The memo presented critical quotes from several former attorneys general in previously published op-eds; Rosenstein concluded that their \"nearly unanimous opinions\" were that Comey\\'s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was “wrong”. \\nhttps://t.co/LHvYNzINXf\\n20. That brings us to the current state of affairs, with the circle of filth in full effect: Peter Strzok was having an affair with Lisa Page, both part of the SC.He texted anti-Trump messages while in the SC. He was also involved in interviewing Hillary\\nhttps://t.co/CmTrmrNulU\\n21. Even before the formation of the SC, there have been concerns regarding FBI’s ability to stay impartial. Andrew McCabe’s wife was paid by DNC PAC’s and was close to Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe\\nhttps://t.co/dE5J2Ak6zF\\n22. Now we find out that  Dossier Author, British Christopher Steele was in contact with Obama Justice dept. associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr, who knew Steele and had repeated contacts with Steele when Steele was working on the dossier.\\nhttps://t.co/swrVJFCIsW\\n23. James Rosen at Fox News reported Ohr was demoted (like Peter Strzok). Remember Ohr met after the election with Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, that hired Steele to compile dossier with funds supplied by Clinton campaign and DNC.\\nhttps://t.co/RIhU08UW39\\n24. This just broke: Democrats were “peddling” salacious Trump dossier allegations to news reporters. DNC and Hillary denied ever knowing about the dossier, even after it was revealed that DNC funded it. Rachel Maddow reported it today, so it must be true \\nhttps://t.co/hdWaIRBBu7\\n25. This Forbes article published Jan 13 2017 is by far the most astute reading of the dossier and why none of it likely to be factually accurate. There is a link to the actual dossier in the article if you are interested. \\nhttps://t.co/PDX6gB3Di3\\n26. I will end with my Word for the day: “presstitute” which goes well with \"circle of filth\". Pressitution is how the circle of filth enlarges unchecked. I hope my effort provides increased clarity in a mostly opaque press reportage.\\n27. The intricate and unwieldy web that will implicate so many politicians and law enforcement officials will approach gargantuan proportions, likely becoming one of the biggest news stories ever. Consider this my humble contribution to its historical and future context. \\n-Fin\\n28. Addendum: I have long held an unsubstantiated belief that the Imran Awan scandal is somehow connected to all of what is going on. The Wasserman-Hillary-Awan connection must lead to the Dossier, somehow. Here is one possible way. \\nhttps://t.co/WsIEJRQjwR\\n29.

       " 'hilo 365': '(1) My support for President Trump hasn\\'t wavered for one moment since I came on board in summer 2016. \\n\\nI\\'ve learned some things from watching the fairweather friends each time they feel like ditching him. So here goes.\\n(2) Facts don\\'t care about your feelings. \\n\\nWhen you freak out and whine about actions you don\\'t like, it makes you look like an SJW snowflake looking around for a safe space. You have abandoned critical thinking.\\n(3) I actually used to be an SJW. It was Donald J Trump who rescued me from the mental quicksand of the Left. \\n\\nAnd it was also Thomas Sowell, Kurt Schlichter, Saul Montes-Bradley, Omni Ceren, Larry Schweikart and John Bolton.\\n(4) I\\'m never going back to SJW-style feeling. I won\\'t call it thinking, because it\\'s not. I have learned: \\n&gt;to question everything \\n&gt;how to assess credibility of claims and sources\\n&gt;how the American system of government works in 2018.\\n(5) Wrote this for my peers who still support POTUS after the necessary evil of signing the bill he called \"ridiculous\" today. Some of you aren\\'t as battle-hardened as me when it comes to the haters. So I will share my approach. When I say \"you,\" I\\'m usually referring to them.\\n(6) The first time I could see who they really are was when the US military bombed the Syrian airfield where the tyrannical Assad regime had launched its chemical attacks on the children of Ghouta in February 2017.\\n(7) After the justified &amp; successful Syrian airfield bombing I was surprised, disappointed and a little hurt by the betrayal of certain \"Trump supporting\" public figures. I unfollowed them on Twitter and stopped sharing their tweets without caveats.\\n(8) The next time they revealed themselves was when the US military dropped a MOAB on about 500 jihadists in Pakistan in April 2017. IMHO the only way to protect innocents from the most hardened terrorists is to kill them. (Explained below):\\n(9) Life imprisonment carries the risk that a future administration will release these hardened terrorists, to kill again. They can never be rehabilitated. Candidate Trump was very clear he agrees with these views.\\n(10) In response to the renewed wailing, I unfollowed some more, &amp; got a little bolder in speaking out against their betrayal. \\n\\nThen POTUS made some genius tactical moves on DACA &amp; other border stuff in Sept. Boy, did the fairweather friends come out in force when he did that.\\n(11)  By now I had learned to stop and think before reacting, and to do my own research, with help from trusted commentators. Dealing with the naysayers was becoming easy, and even fun.\\n(12)  I knew Trump wouldn\\'t just give DACA recipients and their extended families amnesty, and certainly not without establishing such extensive measures and timeframes to make it all but impossible for people to obtain citizenship this way.\\n(13) I still trust him to do the best thing for Americans first on this matter. So seeing \"No DACA\" and \"No Amnesty\" was a dead giveaway as to whether someone was on my wavelength or not.\\n(14) When POTUS was leading the Tax Bill process in November and December 2017, there were confused worriers then, too. Occasionally I would give information to the nice ones; and troll the unpleasant ones, as if I was a cat repeatedly tossing a half dead mouse in the air.\\n(15)  I will never forget the remarks made and photos taken after that bill was signed. I realized Hatch, McConnell and even Ryan patently weren\\'t as determined to abuse GOP voters as the fairweather friends had convinced me they were in 2016.\\n(16)  Even Bob Corker smiled when someone thanked Trump for his part in the tax bill. I have the screenshot. All 50 GOP Senators in DC voted for it. Only McCain didn\\'t, since he was in Arizona. \\n\\nBut still the naysayers deny that some of them can ever do anything right.\\n(17) On December 12, Roy Moore lost the ALSen race. The usual suspects had been on his side, even in the primary when Trump had clearly preferred Luther Strange.\\n(18) Not enough AL GOP voters listened to Trump and trusted his judgment. End of story. I blocked an enormous number of people because of their irrational screeching about Roy Moore. Oh well.\\n(19) Other events occurred that reinforced my views about these self-proclaimed sometime Trump \"supporters.\" In short, they are either mistaken about the facts or, more likely, were never Trump supporters. (Continued)\\n(20) They come in various flavors, foreign and domestic. Some are literally Russian (you can tell by the broken English), or Russian-funded, or Russian-sympathetic.\\n(21) Russia wants to stoke division in the USA. If you don\\'t get that, then you clearly haven\\'t been paying attention lately, or learned the history Europe in the last 102 years. I\\'m not your research assistant so at this point you\\'ll need to find the information yourself.\\n(22) It\\'s actually easy to spot these fake Twitter accounts using a number of variables you can see on their profiles. A low follower count is the most obvious one, but occasionally you see them with &gt;1,000.\\n(23) The American public figures who whine, such as Laura Ingraham (who has even dined at Mar-a-Lago during Trump\\'s Presidency), are motivated by self interest. Playing the part of a contrarian garners TV ratings, online clicks, and book sales for them.\\n(24)  I\\'m no public figure, but I can write.  As I could never sell out my beliefs or be controlled by a boss or funder, I prefer to work for free. This is the best hobby ever.\\n(25) This week I\\'ve written about the budget bill several times, in the courteous, reasonable way I do for good-faith readers. Suffice to say, I understand and support Trump signing the bill. He has weighed the pros and cons, with what he knows (which is more than we do).\\n(26) His oath of office places protecting Americans and America as his highest priority. Military defense is not negotiable. Also, the bill only lasts for 6 months! And he can choose not to use all of the allowed budget in many of the line items, too.\\n(27) Every problem the naysayers have with this bill was caused by people other than Trump. You elected them or allowed them to beat candidates you wanted (or you were too young to vote). The solutions to the problems are also now in your hands, not Trump\\'s. Midterms coming up.\\n(28) What America now needs is your work to return the largest possible majorities in Nov. \\n\\nTo those laying on the floor having a tantrum: Every hour you waste helps the Dems, NeverTrumps, Russia, &amp; all the other countries threatening us &amp; stealing from us, with/without RU help.\\n(29) So think about that. \\n\\nAnd if you try to waste my time complaining to me, don\\'t expect much of a response. I\\'ve heard it all before. \\n\\nMy attention is a privilege not a right and must be earned. \\n\\nEND',\n",

I was the Supervisor over putting Chuckie Taylor away for torture &amp; war crimes, Wesame Deleame for killing American soldiers, Robert Levinson who I believe remains in Iran\\n(3) I believe Bob should have been home at least a decade ago and will not rest until I expose the reason why he was not a priority to McCabe’s best friend, NSB Chief Carl Ghattas. I have worked on the Holyland Foundation aka Hamas case as a case agent over the NJ office head\\n(4) I have been the Supervisory Special Agent over a groundbreaking case that changed the way the Intelligence Community hunted down terrorists. That’s how I met @GenFlynn and other true patriots.  The FBI now has a section in their Counterterrorism Dept based on the work of my\\n(5) team. Funny though not really funny, the only people not to get the Director’s Award for spearheading this op are myself, my analyst and the FBI Attorney who kept us on the right path. We three took beatings for two years to get this going. There is a sinister side to this\\nYou see, when McCabe signed off on the bogus OPR against me, he already knew and admitted he knew I had already filed an EEO complaint or was going to file one against the two individuals who wrote up the referral to OPR, five days after I filed my EEO. Six days after my SES boss\\n(7) six days after my boss told me he’d pull my timecards “if I took that route.” So I was involuntarily removed from my position of Senior Detailee to the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center.  Unbeknownst to the FBI, my direct supervisor praised my performance in an unclassified email\\n(8) Meanwhile, the GS-15 salary that you tax payers were paying the salary of was idled and given nothing to do for months.If I got an assignment, it was usually clerical. I had supervised multi-national operations against terrorists all over the world @ Washington Field Office’s\\n(9) Extraterritorial Counterterrorism Squad. I beat out 26 people to get selected for this post. Later, the FBI selected me #1 to represent them at a four month advanced security session (4 months) in Garmisch, Germany. 141 participants from 43 countries.\\n(10) I was the only native English speaking female in that class.  I represented the FBI proudly and even taught a couple classes since they used cases I had worked on in their curriculum.

I returned to my post as the Unit Chief in WMD Directorate Executive Strategy Unit.When I saw the position of Joint Duty Detailee to the CIA, I knew it was the position I was working towards throughout\\n(12) career.  I watched the twin towers come down in front of me, I had crucial  relationships all over the world and now I wanted to work together with the CIA to fight terror.  I was selected for the position and specialized in Yemen and Somalia.  But for only 4-5 months\\n(13) it was during this time that two FBI male agents were harassing me and an African American agent. I stood up for both of us. The harassment and undermining of my critical terrorism work by these two got worse. I tried to tell my Assistant Director Andrew McCabe but was told\\n(14) contacting him was inappropriate.  Mind you, I had worked with McCabe since 2005 and he had been my boss at Washington Field.  So I contacted EEO, since working through the Ombudsman was useless. I had been working on a major disruption of a bombing plot and ten days later\\n(15) I was involuntarily removed from my position. My Deputy Assistant Director told me the AD, McCabe, made the decision. So that’s where I ended up, in that administrative unit doing GS-4 work as a GS-15 step 4. It was there that I saw the write up for someone to get the\\nDirector’s Award for that operation I had discussed earlier in this thread. The narrative contained MY accomplishments but put someone else’s name as the recipient.  They even left in personal commendations from Gen McChrystal and now Gen Flynn, both who didn’t know the buddy of\\n(17) of McCabe’s who actually got the award and $10k as part of it.  Yes, this other person, now head of an office on the West Coast and a part of McCabe’s regime got the Director’s Award using my accomplishments.  Meanwhile, I was actively pursuing my EEO, paying about $57k in\\n(18) attorney fees in one year.  I was notified more than a month after I filed the EEO, that I was under OPR for time and attendance, insubordination and disruptive behavior while on duty.  These charges are used by people when they have nothing but want you out.\\n(19) The two brain surgeons who filed the OPR left their emails in my folder which I got to review.

       " 'hilo 367': 'THREAD. I want to talk to you about what it was like to grow up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a Roman Catholic, and what\\'s helpful or not helpful to say to folks/communities in times like there where yet another hideous ring of abuse has been exposed.\\nI grew up in Scranton. It\\'s a heavily Catholic town -- with parishes &amp; parish schools in every neighborhood (at least when I was still growing up), and with most families taking church really seriously. I know my family did. I missed church &lt;10x in my ENTIRE LIFE before college.\\nI was, myself, a very visibly Catholic kid (I\\'m now athiest). I served the televised masses at St. Anne\\'s Basilica, \"starred\" in the weekly children\\'s mass on TV, attended Catholic school, sang in Catholic youth choirs, won the Bishop\\'s Lay Award for my service to the church.\\nAnd ya\\'ll, I was around these men. Several of the listed men. And I loved them, and I trusted them. And while I will never excuse what they did, I need to explain to you why saying \"Screw these pedo priests\" is not only unhelpful (even to me, who disdains the church) but cruel.\\nIn Scranton, there\\'s no small amount of \"ethnic segregation.\" No, not referring to racism -- referring to ethnic tribalism. Neighborhoods are steeped in ethnicity: Minooka/Irish, West/Italian, South/German, East/Slovac, Moosic/Polish. Churches supported specific communities.\\nMy 1st church, St. Mary Czestochowa, is 1 block from my parents\\' house. 1 block the other direction is my dad\\'s childhood home. He attended SMC all his life until we switched to a nearby Irish parish (then St. Joe\\'s, now Divine Mercy) because I started singing the masses there.\\nThese ethnic churches are bastions of ties to Old World communities that represent so much more than any God. They were places old languages were kept alive. Old lullabyes from old countries. Traditional foods. Traditional customs. Ways of life that were carried across oceans.\\nI remember growing up in SMC. The smell of Polish foods cooking in the church basement during my Sunday classes. Learning about Poland. The soft sound of elderly Polish women singing and talking in Polish, teaching us Christmas Carols and Polish swear words. Keeping Poland alive.\\nThe Church made my family\\'s history real. We are nearly completely Polish, and my engagement in SMC even as a child blurred together my ethnicity, my identity and sense of history, my understanding of god, my understanding of my family. It was never just about \"the church.\"\\nThe church was both a spiritual \"Jesus\" community and a spiritual \"Polish\" community. It was a family that sustained itself and its members through lore, love, shared memory, a sense of purpose and identity that seemed frozen so beautifully in time amidst a modernized world.\\nWhen I wasn\\'t at my home church, I attended Catholic School. St. Mary\\'s Assumption, then Marian Catholic. I loved those schools, where nuns taught some of the classes &amp; priests were teachers, coaches, chaperones, mentors, friends. Religious people were the fabric of my education.\\nI sang in a Catholic School youth choir, and we performed each year in Cathedral Capers -- a cabaret showcasing the musical talents of nuns, priests, and various Catholics of the diocese. It. Was. SO. Fun. I can still remember how hard Fr. Altavilla made me laugh. He was so kind.\\nBetween Capers, and Catholic School, and my involvement at St. Anne\\'s doing the televised masses, I. Met. A. Lot. Of. Priests. I worked closely with them. Traveled with them. Laughed with them. Looked up to them. Loved them. In the trusting way that young people do.\\nAnd I know multiple men who have now been accused. And my heart breaks. Not for me -- they didn\\'t touch me -- but for the communities they served, and the sense of \"living church\" they destroyed. They traumatized children. They LIED. They covered up lies. They kept lying.\\nI grieve the sacred, historical groups they shattered -- no, not the Roman/Vatican kind -- the Polish kind, the German kind, the Irish kind. I grieve the shattered communities of lost languages, special foods, memories of safety and belonging. I grieve the loss of identity.\\nI grieve the warm, safe feeling I had about St. Mary Czestochowa\\'s summer picnic, running through the dark alleyway to my house with my little cousin, bellies full of halupki, excited to announce we won a raffle. I grieve saying \"Zimno!\" when it\\'s cold. I grieve, and grieve.\\nThese priests shattered children. They shattered communities, families, connections to worlds we rapidly lose each day we become a little more \"just American,\" &amp; a little less Polish, or Slovac, or German, etc -- those aspects of ethnicity that create identity, value, a home.\\nI lost some part of my stake in this when I saw Fr. Homer named. Fr. Homer was the last pastor I knew at St. Mary Czestochowa. I shook his hand every Sunday for years. I can\\'t look at those years the same. I wept when I saw Fr. Altavilla, Fr. Paulish. Men I knew and loved.\\nTo be clear: I don\\'t think my losses rival that of their victims. I don\\'t think explaining the Catholic Church\\'s cultural significance in a Blue Collar town will convince most of you that the Church matters. It\\'s OK if you don\\'t think that. But here\\'s what I do need you to know.\\nWhen you say \"The Church is disgusting,\" you are maligning more than pedophiles, more than corrupt Bishops like James Timlin. When you call all priests rapists, you malign more than those men who are. When you roll your eyes about another Catholic Church scandal, you hurt me.\\nWhen you roll your eyes at yet more hurt, you hurt me/others like me whose childhoods, adulthoods, souls, memories are wrapped up in the difficult/painful legacies these men left behind. You hurt my connection to Poland. You hurt my memories of Baptisms, Confirmations, funerals.\\nIt is too easy and too simple to think that the Catholic Church only keeps the god-souls of its flock alive. No. The Catholic Church I knew was a living god, a human collection of souls, a place of connection to one another and to a cultural identity we were losing in America.\\nThe Catholic Church I grew up in was representative of a human soul. Not just one that loved Jesus, but one that loved Polish carols and homemade pierogi and pascha bread and family crests and cursing in Yiddish and babcis and families and a home that was both here AND there.\\nI DO NOT EXCUSE THESE HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY MEN I LOVED. I don\\'t ask you to. But when you insult the church writ large in response to these crimes, know that the emotional EXPERIENCE of church is distinct from the ORGANIZATION of church, for many.\\nKnow that my sweet grandmothers knitting quilts in church basements and straightening their grandson\\'s ties are not the acts of Bishop Timlin nor his priests. Know that the church-as-community is where Catholicism lives, for Catholics, not the church-as-Vatican or church-as-law.\\nAnd know that no matter HOW many times another sexual violence ring is exposed, it is not \"old news\" to the children-now-grownups who have awoken to see their heroes dethroned and destroyed and unrecognizable. It\\'s not old news. It hurts fresh, it hurts raw, it hurts real.\\nSo in the rush to glibly deride Catholics, Catholicism, the Church, etc. in the wake of scandal, I just ask that you limit your vitriol to the criminals themselves and I ask that you consider how they\\'ve shattered children, yes, but communities too. And that there\\'s such grief.\\nIt isn\\'t old news to anyone who grew up in a Catholic town. Our very childhoods are pulverized, even if no priest laid his hands on us. Our hearts are broken. Spare us your glib vitriol long enough to let us grieve the loss of men we thought we knew, men we thought we loved.\\nThese priests and their enablers deserve the worst of what comes to them. I do not condone them. I do not forgive them. I am enraged by all they have broken. I am enraged by what we lose every time we drift further from communities where we should have felt safe.\\nI hope in your calls for justice, you can remember that their wreckage extends beyond known victims. Please. I hope you can know that when you malign Catholicism writ large, you\\'re maligning so much more than you intend.\\n\\nThe Church is bleeding out its poison. Allow us our grief.',\n",

Immediately following the news of a Michael Flynn indictment release, a blitzkrieg of parallel randomly stories surfaces.  Including https://t.co/8d3qHNaL6g\\n17.  Litterally at the same time an indictment against Flynn is announced.  Someone within the intelligence community hits back with information about more DOJ corruption; this time DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr:  https://t.co/8d3qHNaL6g https://t.co/vtDniv5nQg\\n18.  Why?  What\\'s going on?  Why is the IC hitting back hard against Robert Mueller\\'s team outcome, by releasing damaging information about those who have participated inside the Mueller investigation?   Who is punching back?  It\\'s not the media. This is insider justice stuff. https://t.co/j8ptMa3El3\\n19.  This part of the intelligence community is transparently pissed off.  They keep striking out pummeling the Mueller team.   Why?  Who are they?  And they don\\'t let up... https://t.co/7yCmAumkg1\\n20.  Whoever *they* are, inside this IC writ large, is not just hitting out - they are naming names. They\\'ve named: Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Andrew \"Andy\" McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, Glenn Simpson, and they don\\'t let up.  https://t.co/7yCmAumkg1\\n21. Not only do they name names, but they actually provide physical evidence that goes along with those names.  Text messages between the participants: https://t.co/ZXRGO3ngXH\\n22.  It just seems odd that no-one ever asked WHY?  Why is it important to these people to put this information out.  Up until December 2017 almost all leaks were against the office of the presidency.  These are against IC Officials.\\n23.  This series of coordinated stories distributed to the media are not random occurrences.  The frequency and timing is too well coordinated. The MSM are forced to cover them - even though they don\\'t want to.  But no-one in MSM asks WHY? Why are these IC reports coming out?\\n24.  And the deluge of IC push-back doesn\\'t let up.  Two days after James Baker accompanies Andrew McCabe to a House hearing BOOM he\\'s nailed too. https://t.co/ykkh7yZxz2\\n25.  Less than a day after Intel Chairman Nunes tells the media of his intention to question FBI lead counsel James Baker https://t.co/EWOWTFAMEp WHAMMO !!  Baker is defrocked, put in charge of counting staplers, and exposed as a leaker.  https://t.co/eWct9CxdM8 https://t.co/e0GqkqZ1Lj\\n26. All of this happens in a matter of a stunning two weeks +/- a few days.  Yet, no-one seems to ask why?  Why then?  Why was it important to *someone* to get this information out, get these people exposed, and get this into the media bloodstream.\\n27. Not a single one of the stories around Strzok, Page, Comey, B Ohr, or N Ohr, Simpson, McCabe, or Baker was real-time information attached to their current activity. All of the information was as they are quarantined. Yet it all came out in a two week period.  Why?\\n28.  I just find it interesting that no-one in MSM is looking at the reason we are able to put all of this together.  The story, and scale, of corruption inside the FBI and DOJ is obviously important to someone inside the FBI and DOJ. https://t.co/glBz1DOGCL\\n29.  And whoever it is, for whatever motive they have, they have presented a ton of evidence preparing us for something rather significant.  It\\'s remarkable how much the MSM is ignoring it. https://t.co/dhUVlXZxK1\\n30.  Goodnight. https://t.co/003xdG6lpP',\n",
       " 'hilo 369': 'I had a police officer stationed in my high school. At one point he got a warrant to investigate me for a stolen calculator, that I didn’t steal. He kicked down my door after school one day with 8 other cops in riot gear with guns drawn on my Grandma.\\nI ran upstairs and hid under the bed because I thought he was there to kill me. He took my computer, phone, and trashed my entire room as an officer held me and my grandmother in my kitchen at gun point.\\nI was expected to go to school the next day with him there. I had to hold it all in. I had nightmares about it for years. I couldn’t focus in class, I was always terrified. The white kids were getting stickers from him as I feared for my life.\\nI couldn’t get school work done the same as the other kids because I had no computer so I fell behind. This impacted which colleges I could go to.\\nAt one point he finally returned my items. I was obviously not charged. But he would constantly pull me out of class in a public manner and question me about the calculator. He would do so with my vice principle in the room.\\nEventually everyone knew I was always being talked to by the officer so it impacted my reputation and only enforced the stereotypes my white peers already held.\\nThen, as I was in contention to become the captain of the track team, despite his efforts, he showed up at practice and handcuffed me in front of my coaches and teammates.\\nHe took me to jail where I sat for hours. My parents were on vacation, there was no one I could call. He then told me I was not under arrest but that he was trying to teach me a lesson.\\nAfter that the coaches would not let me become captain, again impacting my college options. It also impacted which kids would risk associating with me. For some kids this means hanging out with kids who are actually committing crimes and falling into that life.\\nI cannot state enough how terrified I was in school at all times. Every morning I wondered if he would arrest me at school. I saw him everyday. Every night when I was supposed to do homework, I was worried he would kick my door in again.\\nEvery knock on the door terrified me my entire life, up until this day. The funny thing is, I was not political at all before this. But this and other experiences I had with police throughout my life pushed me into fighting for justice.\\nThe police didn’t just harass me and my high school friends at school. It was just part of life being black in a white neighborhood. Being stopped at the age of 14 and asked why I’m in my own neighborhood...\\nOr walking my dog and police pulling up and saying I was reported as a potential drug dealer by my own neighbors.\\nBeing thrown to the ground at 13 because I matched the description of someone who got in a fist fight.\\nBeing with my friend who was a recent rape victim when she saw her abuser and called the cops because she had a restraining order and police showing up and handcuffing me for their protection even though I wasn’t involved. I was 14. He Didn’t cuff the white kids around.\\nBeing stopped at 15 while walking down the street and drinking a water bottle because police said it looked like vodka. At 15...\\nBeing stopped at 16 while crossing the street because my pants were sagged and my backpack looked heavy so they thought I had a gun.\\nThis is just the life of a black kid. It’s just expected to be normal. It was the life of all my friends. We thought that was just life. We knew it didn’t happen to our white peers but we just thought it’s how it was. We thought we were flawed.\\nSo I say all this because these white school board members voting for more cops just don’t know what this all feels like. I will have this trauma for the rest of my life. It permanently messed me up. It ruined high school and narrowed my opportunities.\\nI was just a kid. People of color already have the entire deck stacked against us but to then throw salt in the wound and have those officers sit in the room next to us and expect us to learn? The same ones who harass us all day in and out of school?\\nAnd I didn’t even steal the damn calculator. I wasn’t the best kid. I smoked pot and cussed with my friends. But I knew white kids doing cocaine at 16. They had never had an interaction with police except when they got their damn stickers.\\nOur white students feared detention, I feared arrest. To hear white people tell me that Officer was there for my protection is laughable. He was there to oppress people of color.\\nAnd before you say I just had a bad cop, he quit being a police officer. He told me through a mutual friend that he quit because of me. He was horrified looking back at what he was forced to do to me. Idk what forced means in this context. Just what he said.\\nAnyways, just writing this thread really fucking hurts. I am one of the lucky ones. This isn’t about safety this is about trauma that you are giving little kids. Just please don’t.\\n@AmandaFritzRN @ChloeEudalyPDX @joannhardesty @tedwheeler please read this before you vote for more cops.\\nI only added commissioner elect Hardesty and Commissioner Eudaly because they can use these stories as more fuel to convince their colleagues, I trust them. I didn’t add Nick Fish cuz I couldn’t find his twitter handle lol. Someone tag him.\\nFuck I’m literally still crying I can’t believe writing that shit was so hard for me. I’m so used to talking about whatever even personal stuff and never being nervous but this really cuts deep. I was so damn young. I was good. They really fucked me up y’all. I don’t even cry lol\\nI didn’t expect this to blow up but since it did, there are things you can do.\\n- pressure your local officials to remove officers from schools\\n- uplift stories like these\\n- support PoC activists and businesses we need y’all to use your privilege to help offset these stories.\\nAnd when I say support I don’t just mean tweets. Buy from black owned businesses, donate to black and PoC orgs, compensate people for the work they are doing to change the world. My cash is $gregorymckelvey but there are people in your town too. Support them.\\nWe have to jump ten times higher to get to the same place. Help us with a boost.',\n",

Emergency dispatch services, hospitals, prisons, schools, etc. Multiple \"victims\" in what CenturyLink called a \"network element\".\\n\\nhttps://t.co/dbNfWuoHQZ\\n5. But, realize just how CONTROLLED this hit was! It caused disruption to emergency services, but the emergency broadcast systems setup by POTUS early in his presidency worked just fine, notifying the majority of citizens of alternate numbers to 911 in case of emergency.\\n6. Hospitals weren\\'t shut down, they just had to use pen and paper for a little while. Prisons weren\\'t unlocked and gates opened, they just had to use radios instead of the phones. Schools had to have runners go to classrooms instead of using designated call systems. It was safe.\\n7. That\\'s a MAJOR tell folks. Do you imagine Russia, China, North Korea, or any of the rest of the \"enemies\" of America the fake news media tries to scare us about would\\'ve been that \\'reserved\\' in a hit on the US system? But, it won\\'t retract from eventually blaming them I bet!\\n8. I posted this thread on ties between HRC, BC, the CFoundation and the Chinese.

But man this is HUGE! CenturyLink, the group that got hit yesterday causing all of these outages, ARE MAJOR DEEP STATE! Folks, they have contracts for 911 services, hospital communications, prison systems and Dept of Defense (DOD) contracts for dark fiber communications.\\n10. They\\'re also tied into lottery systems, schools, banking communications and more. Do any of you think that one company, having all that oversight and control is a responsible thing to do? They have a monopoly on the biggest communications systems in this country!\\n11. But, how exactly did they get all that control? Well, hold onto your sneakers. They have been steadily increasing their footprint and their control over nearly every single internet, phone, and communications provider in the US! They\\'re massive! https://t.co/iKTqsd2F9A\\n12. But, who really controls them? Everybody knows, all decisions come from the top, right? Well...let\\'s look at who OWNS CenturyLink. You\\'re not going to believe this. Number one shareholder with 123+ million shares, worth $2.61 BILLION, is, Temasek holdings. Sound familiar?\\n13. It didn\\'t strike me right away either until I realized Temasek is basically a shell corporation. It has OWNERSHIP investments in...Alibaba Group Holdings! Any idea who that is? You should! Alibaba Group Holdings was started with money from LIPPO\\'s Riady family and friends.\\n14. Temasek also has ownership holdings in: CTL = CenturyLink. GILD = Gilead Sciences - a huge pharmaceutical corporation which is rumored to be tied to the tainted HIV medication the CFoundation and BC purchased with the help of Riady. It was sold to Africa and it killed people!\\n15.

That\\'s when GHWB was liaison to China,  then became CIA director! Humm...\\nhttps://t.co/iKTqsd2F9A\\n18. Where did CenturyLink get all its government contracts and just how much do they control? This is where the monopolization gets scary. They\\'re not just controlling American communications anymore. It\\'s going worldwide! Look at this! They\\'re everywhere! https://t.co/Ob8ajGJ3u8\\n19. Truth be told, even with all of their control, all their contracts, and all of their assets, are they really performing well enough to continue this monopolization? Some experts say they\\'re not doing as well as regular investors like us would hope. https://t.co/W0R0nxGsKu\\n20. So, why in the world would they continue to be awarded contracts, move into bigger markets, and overtake more \"successful\" corporations like Verizon? Well, that\\'s where this \"alternative agenda\" comes in and suggests the Deep State is doing this for a reason. Look at this!\\n21. \"Alibaba is kicking off its annual Alifest conference in Hangzhou, China next week with a star-studded lineup of speakers to help celebrate its 10th anniversary....Keynote presenters at the SME Summit include President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J.

What does that sound like? Folks, the Keystone is...the 1st amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is the KEY that all other rights hinge on. It is our most precious right.\\n27. Those sons of bitches who control, manipulate, silence and otherwise prohibit our speech literally overtook our ability to communicate.

       " 'hilo 372': '1/ Thread analyzing Judge O\\'Connor\\'s ACA decision https://t.co/hOWHPMhaSj\\n2/ The court found that the individual parties have standing, even though there is no penalty for going uninsured: there is no requirement to show economic injury to establish standing. The mandate, by itself, suffices. https://t.co/QGlVx6QQ6I\\n3/ Moreover, a decision for the Plaintiffs would \"free\" them from mandate, so causation and redressability are satisfied. https://t.co/KvBhWwqII1\\n4/ Next, the Court followed the reasoning of NFIB to conclude that the individual mandate, without the penalty, is unconstitutional. https://t.co/ZtcHFy0GVf\\n5/ The Court draws the important distinction: the mandate and the penalty are different statutory provisions. Cong exempted some ppl from penalty, but not mandate. This fact shows that the unpenalized mandate has force. Many critics of this decision do not recognize this fact https://t.co/QswIlmKpUZ\\n6/ Congress in 2010 (ACA) and 2017 (TCJA) treated mandate and penalty as separate provisions. https://t.co/PcV2Q8RoRr\\n7/ The Court also rejects the intervenor\\'s argument that the penalty from 2018 will continue to generate revenue for years to come, because people may delay paying that exaction. https://t.co/p4WtcFYxou\\n8/ Because the mandate no longer triggers a tax, it cannot be saved under the Taxing Power. https://t.co/tmzFquyniP\\n9/ Judge O\\'Connor also reaches an important point that many critics reject: a mandate, without a penalty, still \"has an enormous influence on social norms and individual conduct in society.\" https://t.co/bLO0HASZtx\\n10/ In conclusion, the Court found that \"the Individual Mandate, unmoored from a tax, is unconstitutional\" https://t.co/4plju6KVTz\\n11/ Next, the Court turns to severability--the most difficult aspect of the case. The parties disagree on which intent controls \"the 2010 Congress that passed the ACA or the 2017 Congress that passed the TCJA.\" I address this question in my new article: https://t.co/OZsgtyYHUS https://t.co/1XjVJnuer9\\n12/ The Court concludes that it doesn\\'t matter which Congress\\'s intent controls. \"the Court finds both Congresses manifested the same intent: The Individual Mandate is inseverable from the entire ACA\" https://t.co/VeeBouZ9LI\\n13/ The strongest indication of Congress\\'s 2010 intent was in the findings (part of the statute) which were not repealed. https://t.co/MtLfc9W7Dv\\n14/ J. O\\'Connor notes DOJ took same position here, as it did in NFIB: GI and CR are not severable from mandate. However, he notes that many NFIB amici now take a different position. \"But that was then, and this is now.\" https://t.co/cVzCECK5dP\\n15/ J. O\\'Connor cites NFIB and King v. Burwell to show that \"Individual Mandate is inseverable from the entirety of the ACA\" (with a citation to @RandyEBarnett) https://t.co/5EmePfTqAe\\n16/ The Court concludes that \"That requirement—the Individual Mandate— was essential to the ACA’s architecture.\" Therefore, it is inseverable from rest of law. Here, Judge O\\'Connor quotes from #Unprecedented about the death spiral that will result in a mandate-less ACA https://t.co/drb7ukKORZ\\n17/ The Court also notes that a mandate-less ACA is an entirely new law, which would shift costs for uncompensated care. (Here, he cites #Unprecedented again) https://t.co/RByrWi6dZP\\n18/ In sum, the Court finds that the 2010 Congress would not have enacted the ACA but for the ACAs. This conclusion is consistent with the NFIB joint dissent, and implied by the RBG opinion. https://t.co/vfGTVIxbiV\\n19/ The far more important aspect of the opinion focuses on the intent of Congress in 2017. J. O\\'Connor explains that due to the reconciliation process, Congress could not have had an intent about the mandate. https://t.co/V90oKd5Mvs\\n20/ In 2017, Congress did not repeal the individual mandate. Therefore, 2017 Congress \"intended to preserve the Individual Mandate because the 2017 Congress, like the 2010 Congress, knew that provision is essential to the ACA\" https://t.co/IdROACxLrA\\n21/ Second, 2017 Congress did not (and could not) repeal statutory findings that mandate was \"essential\" to ACA https://t.co/4leG8dXsbx\\n22/ Third, the Court recognizes the key limitation on the 2017-intent argument: because of the reconcliation rules, Congress could not--and did not--modify the intent of the 2010 Congress. https://t.co/47gPdkaFbV\\n23/ Finally, the Court rejects the intervenor\\'s alternative argument: if 2017 Tax Cut law rendered the mandate is unconstitutional, then the correct remedy is to declare the Tax Cut unconstitutional. Here, the court adopts my argument in #Undone https://t.co/OZsgtyYHUS https://t.co/uGNyfbcF7P\\n24/ Five points to respond to common criticisms. First, the text of the ACA distinguishes between the mandate and the shared responsibility payment. The law describes only the former as \"essential\" to the ACA. The mandate survives TCJA\\n25/ Second, Congress in 2017 could not, and did not repeal the individual mandate. If the Republicans had 60 votes, they would have taken that step, but couldn\\'t. This reality demonstrates that the intent was to leave the individual mandate in place.\\n26/ Third, the most intuitive answer is that the intent of Congress in 2017 matters, not the intent of Congress in 2010. Severability doctrine must consider whether, and how Congress in 2017 modified the law. See point #2 above.\\n27/ Fourth, the joint opinion in NFIB expressly found the mandate could not be severed from the rest of the ACA. The other opinions suggested as much. And King v. Burwell reaffirmed that linkage.\\n28/ Fifth, J. O\\'Connor stopped short of entering a nationwide injunction (a refreshing change of pace). We only have a grant of summary judgment. Now, this issue can percolate up to #SCOTUS in the usual course.\\n29/ One final point. President Trump quickly opined on the matter in two tweets: https://t.co/wfCDgOxFR2\\n30/ Here, we do not have an Obama Judge or a Trump judge, but a highly respected judge https://t.co/VqujmlynJv\\n31/ The third book in the Obamacare trilogy continues to write itself.

       " 'hilo 374': 'Trump Scores, Breaks Generals’ 50-Year War Record \\n\\nHis national security team had been trying to box him in like every other president. But he called their bluff.\\n https://t.co/3QaDZfv9be\\nThe mainstream media has attacked President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as impulsive, blindsiding his own national security team.\\nBut detailed, published accounts of the policy process over the course of the year tell a very different story.\\nThey show that senior national security officials and self-interested institutions have been playing a complicated political game for months aimed at keeping Trump from wavering on our indefinite presence on the ground in Syria.\\nThe entire episode thus represents a new variant of a familiar pattern dating back to Vietnam in which national security advisors put pressure on reluctant presidents to go along with existing or proposed military deployments in a war zone.\\nThe difference here is that Trump, by publicly choosing a different policy, has blown up their transparent schemes and offered the country a new course, one that does not involve a permanent war state.\\nThe relationship between Trump and his national security team has been tense since the beginning of his administration.\\nBy mid-summer 2017, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joseph Dunford had become so alarmed at Trump’s negative responses to their briefings justifying global U.S. military deployments that they decided to do a formal briefing at the Pentagon.\\nBut when Mattis and Dunford sang the praises of the “rules-based, international democratic order” that has “kept the peace for 70 years,” Trump simply shook his head in disbelief.\\nBy the end of that year, however, Mattis, Dunford, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed they’d succeeded in getting Trump to use U.S. troops not only to defeat ISIS but to “stabilize” the entire northeast sector of Syria and balance Russian and Iranian-sponsored forces.\\nYet they ignored warning signs of Trump’s continuing displeasure with their vision of a more or less permanent American military presence in Syria.\\nIn a March rally in Ohio ostensibly about health care reform, Trump suddenly blurted out, “We’re coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon—very soon we’re coming out.”\\nThen in early April 2018, Trump’s impatience with his advisors on Syria boiled over into a major confrontation at a National Security Council meeting, where he ordered them unequivocally to accept a fundamentally different Syria deployment policy.\\nTrump opened the meeting with his public stance that the United States must end its intervention in Syria and the Middle East more broadly. He argued repeatedly that the U.S. had gotten “nothing” for its efforts, according to an account published by the AP.\\nWhen Dunford asked him to state exactly what he wanted, Trump answered that he favored an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces and an end to the “stabilization” program in Syria.\\nMattis responded that an immediate withdrawal from Syria was impossible to carry out responsibly, would risk the return of Islamic State, and would play into the hands of Russia, Iran, and Turkey, whose interests ran counter to those of the United States.\\nTrump reportedly then relented and said they have could five or six months to destroy the Islamic State. But he also made it clear that he did not want them to come back to him in October and say that they had been unable to defeat ISIS and had to remain in Syria.\\nWhen his advisors reiterated that they didn’t think America could withdraw responsibly, Trump told them to “just get it done.” \\n\\nTrump’s national security team had prepared carefully for the meeting in order to steer him away from an explicit timetable for withdrawal.\\nThey brought papers that omitted any specific options for withdrawal timetables. Instead, as the detailed AP account shows, they framed the options as a binary choice—either an immediate pullout or an indefinite presence in order to ensure complete and permanent defeat of ISIS\\nThe leave option was described as risking a return of ISIS and leaving a power vacuum for Russia and Iran to fill.\\nSuch a binary strategy had worked in the past, according to admin sources. That would account for Trump’s long public silence on Syria during the early months of 2018 while then-SOS Tillerson and Mattis were articulating detailed arguments for a long-term military commitment.\\nAnother reason the approach had been so successful, however, was that Trump had made such a big issue out of Barack Obama giving the Pentagon a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan. As a result, he was hesitant to go public with a similar request for a Syria timetable.\\nA DoD official who had been briefed on the meeting “rejected that any sort of timeline was discussed.” Furthermore the official asserted that Mattis “was not asked to draw up withdrawal options….”\\nLieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Chiefs, also told reporters, “the president has actually been very good in not giving us a specific timeline.”\\nNevertheless, without referring to a timeline, the White House issued a short statement saying that the U.S. role in Syria was coming to a “rapid end.”\\nMattis and Dunford were consciously exploiting Trump’s defensiveness about a timeline to press ahead with their own strategy unless and until Trump publicly called them on it. That is what finally happened some weeks after Trump’s six month deadline had passed.\\nThe claim by Trump advisors that they were taken by surprise was indeed disingenuous. What happened last week was that Trump followed up on the clear policy he had laid down in April.\\nThe Syria withdrawal affair is a dramatic illustration of the fundamental quandary of the Trump presidency in regard to ending the state of permanent war that previous administrations created.\\nAlthough a solid majority of Americans want to rein in U.S. military deployments in the Middle East and Africa, Trump’s national security team is committed to doing the opposite.\\nTrump is now well aware that it is virtually impossible to carry out the foreign policy that he wants without advisors who are committed to the same objective.\\nThat means that he must find people who have remained outside the system during the permanent war years while being highly critical of its whole ideology and culture.\\nIf he can fill key positions with truly dissident figures, the last two years of this term in office could decisively clip the wings of the bureaucrats and generals who have created the permanent war state we find ourselves in today.',\n",
       " 'hilo 375': 'Please stop using the open (and closed) reference clustering methods based on USEARCH/VSEARCH.  Instead, use de novo clustering algorithms to form OTUs 1/\\nOpen/closed reference methods were developed because people have the type of crappy data that you get when reads don\\'t fully overlap. High error rates increase the number of uniques making downstream processing more difficult 2/ https://t.co/TwQmAnJ4M8\\nSo why are open (and closed) reference clustering bad? Let\\'s look at closed reference first. I may self-plagiarize in some of the following tweets 3/ https://t.co/SV7G8C5M7v\\nObviously, you\\'re limited to seeing what is in the database. Considering we\\'re sequencing deeper than any of the studies that generated the reference sequences, we\\'re going to fail to classify many sequences 4/\\nUsing a mouse dataset we found 32,106 unique sequences. Using a 3% threshold we were able to map 27,876 w/ VSEARCH and 27,737 w/ USEARCH - both methods are heuristics, which help to speed things up, but cut corners 5/\\nWhen we calculated the actual distances between the mouse sequences and the database sequences, we were able to map 28,238 sequences to a reference 6/\\nWe then randomized the order of the database. We got different numbers of sequences to map to a reference with different randomizations. The default order is probably about as bad as you could do 7/ https://t.co/v5Txhea2US\\nThe XSEARCH heuristics cut corners and don\\'t have perfect sensitivity. But they also result in a loss of specificity - USEARCH was 0.73 and VSEARCH was 0.60 8/\\nBut that\\'s just the start. The reference that many use is based on the greengenes database (fwiw - greengenes is defunct and the database has not been updated) 9/\\nThe reference represents sequences that are not more than 97% similar to each other...  over the full length of the gene. We popped out the V4 region of those sequences 10/\\nAmong these V4 fragments, we found that 3,132 ref sequences had one duplicate, of those, 443 had discordant taxonomies.

They aren\\'t from the references\\' perspective. This has consequences for people using Fast UniFrac, PICRUSt, etc 15/\\nSome of these problems could be solved w/ a ref where the V4 (or whatever region) sequences are not more than 97% similar to each other, but you\\'d also have to deal with conflicting taxonomies and the poor specificity of XSEARCH 16/\\nLet\\'s discuss one more thing before moving on to open reference clustering. With closed reference, if a seq is more than 97% similar (or whatever level) to a reference, the seq is assigned to that ref OTU 17/\\nWe\\'ve already discussed several problems with this. Another, is that two seqs might only be 94% similar to each other, but be in the same OTU - this isn\\'t what we typically think is going on when we talk about 97% OTUs. Right? 18/\\nNow open reference clustering... In this approach, sequences are first subjected to closed ref clustering and those that don\\'t map to a reference are run through a de novo clustering approach 19/\\nIn de novo clustering sequences that are more than 97% similar to each other are clustered. There are many ways to do this and I certainly have data/papers to support one over the field of methods 20/\\nWhen one uses open ref clustering, you get all the problems of closed reference clustering, but you are also mixing and matching OTU definitions 21/\\nYou get the possibility of sequences that are only 94% similar to each other in the same OTU (closed ref) and those that are at least 97% similar to each other (de novo) 22/\\nDepending on what type of samples you\\'re sequencing you\\'ll get different ratios of OTUs generated by closed ref and de novo clustering. Human/mouse are mostly closed, soil probably has more de novo 23/\\nWe developed using an objective, distance-based metric for assessing OTU clustering quality. It asks are the correct sequences included in the OTU and are there any sequences that should have been included in the OTU? It\\'s called MCC 24/\\nHere\\'s what we saw for a few datasets. This shows that the closed/open reference algorithms don\\'t measure up to de novo https://t.co/Gsg6C9hCfV 25/ https://t.co/1eyyurrXlg\\nLater we developed our own de novo heuristic that optimizes MCC as it forms the OTUs - OptiClust. This forms the best OTUs of any clustering method we\\'ve found https://t.co/1fEDtlt3x2 26/ https://t.co/ZQb9fZvSKi\\nOne nock against de novo methods is that you get different results for each iteration of the method. Yup. What we\\'ve found is that you get equally good clusterings - there is no one optimal method 27/\\nThere\\'s also the nock that we shouldn\\'t be using OTUs, but that\\'s a topic for another tweet storm 28/\\nAppendix: Here\\'s actual data showing what happens when reads don\\'t overlap.

       " 'hilo 377': '1. Remember that WH memo written by McGahn, confidential, that we discussed a while ago? The one detailing a timeline of events leading up to Flynn\\'s resignation? It\\'s in Mueller\\'s hands.Bloop! https://t.co/44TTOLhBoV\\n2.  The reporter for this story has been allowed to READ the memo in its entirety as well as other underlying WH records quoted in the memo, such as other notes and memos written by McGahn and other senior administration officials.\\n3. The reporter also interviewed a dozen former and current WH officials, attorneys who have interacted with Mueller\\'s team and witnesses questioned by Mueller.\\n4. Doowd and SEkulow quoted selectively from this memo to argue that Trump did not obstruct justice. THey also said (LOL) that even if Trump knew there had been FBI probe of Flynn, he believed Flynn had been cleared. Double LOL. Sure, that\\'s why he asked Comey to let it go.\\n5. Full review of the memo on part of the reporter \"flatly contradicts\" Dowd and Sekulow\\'s story. Memo states Trump WAS told Flynn was under FBI investigation: this statement is based in part on contemporaneous notes written by? Reince Priebus, ding ding, ding!\\n6. Priebus wrote notes after discussing the Flynn FBi probe matter with Trump. If that wasn\\'t enough?McGahn\\'s recollections to HIS STAFF (=more contemporaneous witnesses) about what he personally told Trump Re: Flynn are also included in materials used to write the memo.\\n7. The above statement is corroborated by other records that the reporter was able to review. ALSO: people familiar with the matter told the reporter that BOTH Priebus &amp; McGahn have confirmed in separate interviews with Mueller that they DID tell Trump about FBI probe into Flynn.\\n8. See why that McGahn interview smack in the middle of the Flynn flipping news went on in two separate sessions? BC EVIDENCE. ANd Mueller was probably all \"see your colleague Reince testified the opposite of what you tried to claim here. \"\\n9. Naturally, Trump was told that Flynn was under FBI investigation by BOTH Priebus and McGahn BEFORE he met with Comey and asked him to \"let it go\". So this is pure unadulterated obstruction of justice, confirmed by MULTIPLE contemporaneous witnesses. LOL\\n10. Yates on Jan. 24, 2017 met with McGahn to warn him that US intelligence agencies had intercepted calls between Flynn and Kislyak and that they had discussed sanctions.\\n11. Yates underlined how Flynn concealed the truth from Pence, making Flynn vulnerable to Ryssian blackmail as the Russians knew the truth. LATER THAT SAME DAY McGahn BRIEFED TRUMP about what Yates had told him, per confidential WH records and interviews.\\n12. PRIEBUS was also present at the meeting (hence why, as we always explained, them having same lawyer means SAME version of facts).  the McGahn timeline demonstrates that Trump was CLEARLY informed during that meeting that Flynn was under criminal FBI investigation.  Oops.\\n13. \"Trump directed McGahn to find out more, including any information about the criminal investigation of Flynn, before deciding on a course of action-\" Narrator: Trump decided the course of action was to pressure Comey to \"let it go\". Yeah, intent to obstruct.\\n14. \"A person with first-hand knowledge told me that during interviews with the special counsel, both McGahn and Priebus confirmed that they had informed Trump during this meeting that Flynn was being investigated by the FBI.\" TWO direct witnesses.\\n15. Please note: McGahn LIED in his account to defend Trump, meaning quite certainly he was then FORCED too cooperate with Mueller in order to avoid repercussions.\\n16. \"Further, according to three current and former administration officials, McGahn also relayed to President Trump that Flynn had told the FBI the same false story he’d earlier told Pence (that Flynn had never spoken to Kislyak about sanctions)\" Oh. OH.\\n17. This means Trump KNEW Flynn had lied to the FBI, which is a felony. And yeah, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI when he flipped. YET he kept on lying about Flynn AND not only didn\\'t immediately fire him, but also asked Comey to stop the investigation.\\n18. Reporter: \"Additionally, my sources say that the special counsel also interviewed the two White House attorneys, John Eisenberg and James Burnham, who helped draft the McGahn memo, in which they, too, concluded that Trump was told that Flynn was under FBI investigation. \"\\n19. So literally EVERY legal representative in the WH PLUS Priebus and aides KNOWS Trump willfully obstructed justice AND told Mueller sp. IN case we\\'re not clear. Jolly good.\\n20. BOTH WH attorneys \"said that they questioned McGahn while researching the timeline; one of them independently recalled McGahn’s contemporaneously telling the president that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI\".\\n21. McGahn then on Jan 27 tried to play the \"but if we take action vs Flynn we might interfere with FBI prob\" with Yates. Yates was all \"um no honey, we\\'re not informing you and then expecting you to sit on your hands\".\\n22. The reason why Trump\\'s knowledge of the criminal investigation into Flynn is central to Mueller\\'s obstruction case is bc it clearly reveals and shows Trump\\'s INTENT to obstruct when he told Comey on the night of Jan. 27 to \"let it go\".\\n23. Jan. 27 is when Trump called Comey to invited him to dinner that evening at the WH. Per Comey\\'s testimony, he did NOT understand they would b ALONE until he arrived at the WH. Which obviously constituted a MAJOR problem as it was fully inappropriate.\\n24. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that Trump suggested to him at the dinner that his job might not be secure, leading Comey to believe that Trump was attempting to \"create some sort of patronage relationship\". (which was obviously nowhere near OK).\\n25. Per Comey \"A few moments later the president said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. \"  As we now all know.\\n26. On Feb. 8 the WaPo broke story that Flynn had indeed spoken to Kislyak about sanctions and that OOPS, there were receipts. In attempting to formulate a response, Priebus, McGahn, and Eisenberg questioned Flynn. Flynn\\'s story broke down but he was all \"I don\\'t remember\".\\n27. Priebus then specifically asked Flynn whether he was interviewed by FBI (per memos). “Flynn stated that FBI agents met with him to inform him that their investigation was over.” LOL SERIOUSLY? LIE! So at THAT point, Pence, Priebus and McGahn recommended Flynn be fired.\\n28. The rest is history we know as Flynn resigned on Feb. 13 to avoid being fired. The day AFTER, after ALL that had happened and Trump being FULLY aware of Flynn\\'s total guilt AND of the FBI investigation into Flynn, Trump pressured Comey to shut down the FBI Flynn probe.\\n29. Per known reports, Trump told Comey: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy.” Trump then repeated: “I hope that you can let this go.”  Pure obstruction.\\n30. Let\\'s be clear: by that point not only Trump knew full well that Flynn was extra dirty and had lied to the FBI... Flynn was gone so this wasn\\'t about Flynn AT ALL. This was about Trump being scared of what the FBI would find out ABOUT HIM ordering Flynn to act like a traitor.\\n31. Seukolow and Dowd willfully and blatantly lied to Mueller by exploiting the lie that caused Flynn\\'s firing, which was Flynn telling Priebus McGahn et al that the FBI only spoke with him to tell him the investigation into him had been closed. Incredibly stupid AND sloppy.\\n32. Sekulow and Dowd tried to pretend that Flynn\\'s false assertions were reported to Trump but there is ZERO information OR evidence in that sense. (of course). And even if? They KNEW Flynn had lied and knew straight from Yates, so LOL.\\n33. Buried Lede: \"Aside from McGahn, Eisenberg, and Burnham, the special counsel has interviewed FIVE OTHER attorneys who currently work for the White House counselor or have previously done so, according to administration records\" .  Signed, sealed, delivered.',\n",

       " 'hilo 380': 'What do you tell your kids about borders? Crossing into Canada a few days ago, I warned my 9-yr-old, Saira (not her real name), not to giggle. Crossing was a breeze. Coming back, I said, would take longer...\\nEntering U.S. involved a lot more questions. The guard questioned Saira. Who is, as I said, nine. But she smiled a lot and all was ok; then he told us to turn off the car, &amp; Saira gasped. Border patrol were surrounding car next to us, hands on their guns, shouting...\\nOur guard had his hand on his gun, too, &amp; his eyes on the car. \"Out of the car!\" a guard barked. I was confused. It\\'d pulled up after us. There\\'d been no search, no time for search. They couldn\\'t have found drugs. A woman emerged...\\n\"About 28,\" Saira later estimated. Wore a nice white tank top, glasses. Latinx. Hands in the air. Face stunned and scared. They made her walk backwards, grabbed her arms. \"Are they going to--\" Saira asked. They did. They cuffed her.\\nThey repeated the drill with the man in the passenger seat. He kept glancing over his shoulder as he walked back w/ hands in air, &amp; they kept yelling at him, but he didn\\'t want to fall. Not a time for any mistakes. That\\'s when I made mine...\\nI took pictures. There\\'s a sign on the border booth forbidding cameras, &amp; I didn\\'t notice, so that part\\'s on me. The prohibition of documentation of armed agents of the state? That\\'s on the U.S. government. The guard, tho, blamed me...\\nHe grabbed my phone. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I said. I was w/ my daughter; not a time to invoke journalism. He held up his hand &amp; then began scrolling. Well past the two pics I\\'d just taken. Which constitutes an illegal search, no? I was more worried about my daughter...\\n\"Daddy,\" she asked, \"are you going to get arrested, too?\" I sighed. \"No,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think so, but I might lose my phone.\" This distressed her, too -- it was filled w/ our vacation pictures. \"Pull over,\" the guard said. \"Go through the green door.\"\\nInside was a room crowded, mostly with families. Not detained; paused. Some longer than others. There was no line. \"You wait for them to call your name,\" another dad explained. I noticed something; Saira noticed, too. They kept calling the white people...\\nWhy were white people called before the many non-white families who\\'d been waiting longer? You can guess easily as my 9-yr-old did, but the journalist in me can\\'t say for sure. That\\'s part of power: evidence of discrimination without certainty. Everyone guessing.\\nI\\'m not suggesting that the U.S. border guards had a deliberate plan to favor white people over non-whites. They just appeared to do so. They weren\\'t all white themselves. That\\'s how power works, too: the uniform is that of white supremacy.\\nI was worried about my daughter, of course. And that concern shaped something ugly in me: A hope that our whiteness would keep us out of further trouble. One more aspect of power\\'s control: it plucks the strings of the ugliest chords within you...\\nSure enough, after awhile a guard called us -- ahead of the black family &amp; the Asian family in between which we\\'d been sitting, both waiting longer than us. I went to the counter, glad &amp; guilty &amp; furious. A guard held our passports &amp; my phone...\\nI said what I believed needed to be said, especially with my 9-yr-old holding my hand: \"I\\'m sorry. I was stupid.\" The guard nodded, &amp; handed over our passports &amp; my phone. \"We deleted the pictures you took,\" he said...\\nNow, I can imagine some folks saying, \"I can\\'t believe you apologized to those fascists!\" To which I\\'ll say: That\\'s how power works. It makes you complicit. It makes you craven. I\\'ve experienced it before...\\nI\\'ve reported in countries where men with guns forbid pictures, &amp; I\\'ve had men point their guns at me &amp; order me to delete my pictures. But before I was a journalist, when I was 20, I crossed the Sahara with my older sister. We ran into trouble in Algeria...\\nThis was in 1992. A civil war broke out while we were there. An Islamic party had won a fair election, &amp; the gov\\'t had responded w/ tanks. Some 100,000 would die, but we didn\\'t see any fighting: just a vast crowd, trying to flee, like us, at a remote desert crossing...\\nWe were visibly American. A soldier separated us from the crowd. His rifle strap was too big for his frame, &amp; as he walked the gun slapped his ass. Bap, bap, bap. I was 20, dumb, &amp; I laughed. Bad move. My sister began apologizing. Then she said something in Arabic; he laughed...\\nI asked her what she\\'d said. \"I said, \\'My brother\\'s an idiot,\\'\" she told me. Soon, more soldiers surrounded us: delighted by the young American woman fluent in Arabic. (She\\'s an Arabic lit scholar.) They let me stand, but they made her tea...\\nThey offered her sugar &amp; asked if she was married &amp; what kind of man she wanted to marry &amp; if she might marry an Algerian man. She smiled. After three hours, they let us cross. Everyone else remained, inside the country collapsing into war. That\\'s how power works...\\nThe power of gender, of the men w/ guns who demanded flirtation as the price of crossing the border, &amp; of empire, the American one, that brought us to the front of the line, &amp; of borders, that put little tyrants in charge of lines in the sand...\\nSo even with the guns &amp; the yelling &amp; the confiscated phone, crossing back into the U.S. was a lot easier than out of Algeria, &amp; for that I was glad, &amp; ashamed. \"What happened to the couple?\" my 9-yr-old asked. I had to her I didn\\'t know, that I was afraid we couldn\\'t know...\\nI\\'m not reporting here, I\\'m just talking about crossing the border yesterday, on vacation w/ my daughter. Maybe that couple was wanted for real crimes, for all I know. But their car wasn\\'t searched. \"Was it like the kids?\" my daughter asked. She meant on the Mexican border...\\n\"It might have been,\" I said. She asked if we\\'d done something wrong taking pictures. \"No,\" I said. She pointed out I\\'d said it was stupid. \"Stupid because I got caught,\" I said. \"Stupid because I was with you. I\\'m sorry.\" \"It\\'s not your fault,\" she said. Which was true...\\nThe night before we\\'d watched The Hunger Games. (I know, a little much for a 9-yr-old. But she\\'d read the books, so...) We both thought of the evil \"Peackeepers\" &amp; their white uniforms, &amp; the shouting border guards in their black uniforms...\\nWhen we got to St. Albans, VT, we pulled over and went for a walk. I asked my daughter if she\\'d been afraid. She surprised me. \"No,\" she said. She thought for a moment. \"Mostly, I was burning with anger.\"\\nMy daughter knew we were lucky. She knew if she weren\\'t 9, I might have had a harder time, that if we weren\\'t white we might still be there. But the anger was personal, too. It was all mixed up. That\\'s how power works.\\nLater we came to a covered bridge on which someone had chalked \"Love=Rage.\" That fit her mood, &amp; the chalk was still there, so she added her own message: \"Keep our country colorful.\" That helped, but she was still mad.\\nBecause here\\'s the thing: We got off \"easy,\" right? White privilege, right? *Yes.* &amp; still it sucked, because of what happened &amp; because of the slime of fear &amp; complicity it left on us. I hear white liberals talk sometimes as if they\\'ve nothing to fear...\\n...as if the power of authoritarianism threatens only people of color. It threatens POC more; but it threatens *everybody.* That\\'s what authoritarianism is. You do nobody any favors by imagining you\\'re immune.\\nAs my daughter saw at the border, authoritarianism targets POC first &amp; most severely; the secondary goal of white supremacy, tho, is to keep white subjects in line through a mix of privilege &amp; subtle punishment for questioning that privilege.\\nAuthoritarianism cultivates paranoia &amp; self-censorship. It depends on us to internalize the ways in which it pushes around; it wants us to feel guilty for being afraid. It wants us to speak in the passive voice.\\nAnyway, before we got back on the road, I looked at my phone. Yes, they\\'d deleted the pictures I\\'d taken of border guards surrounding a Latinx couple; and, it seemed, they\\'d also deleted two previous, a pic of a mural &amp; a pic of my daughter smiling over a stawberry smoothie...\\nSo here\\'s a new picture. I don\\'t put my kids\\' pictures on the public internet, but with my daughter\\'s approval -- this is part of her \"burning anger\" -- here she is, adding her slogan, #keepourcountrycolorful, to one of which she approves, not far south of the border. https://t.co/aQLniu1USF',\n",
       " 'hilo 381': 'So, Twitter. In light of the ongoing clusterfuck that is #brexit, let me tell you a little about my white, Australian experience of dealing with the UK visa authority, a complete shitshow of a bureaucracy that is in no way prepared to handle what\\'s coming.\\nMy husband and I first moved to the UK in January 2011. He\\'d been given a position at a good university there - however, because the Tories had slashed the number of visas any uni was allowed to sponsor, they were unable to sponsor him even though they\\'d hired him.\\nFortunately for us, my maternal grandfather was born in the UK, which meant I was eligible for an ancestry visa. A much more expensive visa than a sponsored one would\\'ve been, but it came with greater protections and my husband could work as my spouse. So we opted to do that.\\nOf course, in visa-language, \"spouse\" is code for \"woman who does not work,\" so there was no designated space on my husband\\'s spousal visa application to include his offer of work. We had to put all that info in as an extra detail and hope they noticed.\\nThe whole process was expensive, labrynthine &amp; nervewracking, but in the end, we got to the UK. Fast forward three years, and our son is born in England in 2014. Because the UK has no jus soli, he has no British citizenship; we have to apply to have him recognised as Australian.\\nThis also means that we need to get him a passport so that he can one day leave the country. Which means travelling, in person, to a far-distant visa authority office, which is basically a warehouse, with an infant in tow.\\nWe were there for about SEVEN HOURS.\\nFun fact about visa authority offices: even though it\\'s legally required for children and babies to attend under various circumstances, they contain absolutely zero provisions for people attending with small children. Seven hours in a warehouse with no baby change tables.\\nWe were only able to get hot water to mix with my son\\'s formula by asking to use the employee kitchen, and even then, the guards wouldn\\'t let us in there; they brought us the water, with several frowning and lowkey chiding us as though we had any say in being there with him.\\nI\\'ll note, too, that consulates are similarly restrictive about the needs of babies, but at least they have the excuse of actual security risks to consider and try to run smoothly and on time to compensate for it. The UK visa authority warehouses? Not so much.\\nFastforward again to 2015: we\\'re living in Scotland and considering applying for permanent residency, which means taking the UK citizenship test. The visa processing centre in Aberdeen had been closed, so we had to drive five hours to the one in Dundee after prepaying etc online.\\nWe get to the Dundee centre. It\\'s basically a fancy shed: the entire thing is basically one open room on several levels with office dividers put up. It\\'s freezing cold outside. We, like many other applicants, have our toddler with us of necessity. But \"no babies allowed\" inside.\\nThis is justified because, as stated, the whole place is just a shed - there\\'s no walls between the testing &amp; waiting areas, and they don\\'t want child-noise to distract the test-takers. So anyone with a small child has to wait with them outside. IN SCOTLAND. IN WINTER.\\nIf an adult showed up alone with a baby? They would\\'ve been turned away. Parents who came in pairs had to take turns with their kid outside, where there was no shelter and no place to sit. In 4C weather, I saw a frozen woman cradling a baby in arms as she paced in the wind.\\nMy husband and I were \"lucky\" - we\\'d driven there, so we had the car to sit in. My husband went first while I waited in the car with our son. Fifteen minutes passed. My husband came back, visibly shaking. He hadn\\'t been allowed to even sit the test. Why?\\nBecause on the dropdown form he\\'d filled out online, he\\'d accidentally clicked that he was bringing a different type of valid ID to the one he\\'d actually brought. So even though he had valid ID on him, even though it was the matter of a single mis-checked box, they refused him.\\nNext, it was my turn. Now, at that time, my passport was still in my maiden name, because I\\'d got it just in advance of our wedding to go on our overseas honeymoon. This had posed no issue when getting my visa to the UK, or in opening a bank account there in my married name.\\nAs I\\'d done in every other instance, I\\'d brought my original marriage certificate with me, because all my utilities, bank statements etc referred to me by my married name. Again: this documentation had been sufficient to get me INTO THE ACTUAL COUNTRY and to work and bank there.\\nBut to sit the fucking citizenship test in a shed in Dundee? Oh, no. For that, I was told, only BRITISH marriage certificates could be accepted. Never mind that I was from a Commonwealth country: I was likewise deemed to have insufficient ID and turned away.\\nI asked if I could speak to a supervisor; no, there wasn\\'t anyone higher around than the woman I was dealing with. Could I call the relevant office for help? No; it was Saturday, nobody would answer. The office was closed. So we had to turn around and drive right back home.\\nOn the basis of this, we decided we didn\\'t want to stay in the UK anymore, but we still needed to renew our expiring visas. Which, as they were ancestry visas, meant:\\na) paying around £2000 for the three of us; and\\nb) sending in huge quantities of original ID documents.\\nThese documents included: all our passports, original marriage certificate, all our original birth certificates, my MOTHER\\'S original birth certificate, my GRANDFATHER\\'S original long-form birth certificate, bank &amp; utility statements, original work contracts - EVERYTHING.\\nBy the time we came to send this all off in late November 2015, my husband had a job offer back in Australia, so we planned to leave the UK in April - we only need the visas extended for the next five months. So we send our stuff off, and we wait.\\nAnd wait.\\nAnd wait.\\nWe can see from our bank statements that the UK visa authority has taken the £2000-odd pounds processing fee from us, but we\\'re into 2016 and haven\\'t heard anything - until, in late January, we get a letter telling us that our application and all our documents have been lost.\\nSpecifically: having received our application at their first processing centre, the visa authority took our money, made NO OTHER RECORD OF OUR APPLICATION, and then send our docs on to their other centre, via the REGULAR-ASS UNPROTECTED MAIL SERVICE, whose post depot flooded.\\nOurs was not the only application thus affected. In fact, we were later told by the Australian consulate, fuckups of this nature are *common* to the UK visa authority, who are apparently known for being careless with documents, slow, &amp; generally incompetent by other governments.\\nSo: we need new passports in order to leave the country. But to get new passports, we need new supporting documentation. And all those documents WERE ALSO LOST. And me? My passport is my only photo ID. So we had to get my mother IN AUSTRALIA to get a new birth cert for me.\\nWe then had to organise, and pay out of pocket for, a two-day trip to London (where the consulate is) FROM ABERDEEN, to get new passports in an expedited, not-reliant-on-the-Royal-Mail fashion. Which, again, cost us about £2000 out of pocket. It KILLED our savings.\\nIn the end, the UK visa authority refunded us for the application they couldn\\'t process, and returned our \"lost\" documents (which evidently weren\\'t destroyed by water after all) to us. But by then, it was late in 2016, almost a full year after we\\'d applied, and we were in Aus.\\nWe never recovered or were compensated for the additional £2000 we lost having to sort things out, and because of THEIR ERROR, the UK visa authority now flags all our passports whenever we enter the UK, because for some reason, they need a re-explanation of what happened.\\nThe entire 5 years we lived in the UK - as well-off, white, English-speaking, Commonwealth citizens - the UK visa authority was a hostile, incomprehensible, unpleasant, stressful entity to deal with. That\\'s it\\'s baseline mode: it is profoundly more vile to anyone less privileged.\\nIt\\'s a cold, hard fact that dealing with the UK visa authority trashed both my husband\\'s and my mental health and left us in a financial hole which, without the support of solvent, caring family members, we would never have climbed out of. Years later, we\\'re only just recovering.\\nHow an entity so comprehensively dedicated to intransigence and bureaucratic pettifogging can possibly hope to deal with the hugely expanded workload necessitated by a hard #Brexit is beyond me. They simply won\\'t cope, and any UK citizens wanting visas should beware.\\nIn all respects, the UK visa authority almost perfectly fits the description that Douglas Adams famously gave to his Vogons: \"Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous\" - the \"almost\" is because these days, yeah: they actually ARE evil, too.\\nIn conclusion: the marriage of xenophobia and bureaucratic incompetence is one of the ugliest in the modern world, and that\\'s saying something. The UK isn\\'t alone in perpetuating this particular evil, so let it be a lesson to everyone on a similar path to FIX THAT SHIT NOW.\\n\\nFIN',\n",

       " 'hilo 383': 'All right. I just finished the Mueller Report. I\\'m going to combine the most shocking and important revelations in one thread. Long and short: there was collusion, there was obstruction, Donald Trump needs to be removed from office. Immediately. 1/\\nMueller found that Russia was actively interested in electing Trump president, as early as his announcement, if not earlier. Operations began just as Trump Campaign took off. Obvious the two are parallel organizations that occasionally worked together, had the same goals. 2/\\nMultiple members of the Trump Campaign were approached by Russia. They were receptive sometimes, other times they just proceeded with knowledge that Russia was interfering on their behalf. They were not ignorant of the fact that Russia was interfering, not at all. 3/\\nTrump and Cohen continued work on Trump Tower Moscow deal while actively misleading the public as to whether he had business in Russia. He knowingly lied to the American public while Cohen worked with people who seemingly thought the hotel and the election were intertwined. 4/\\nPerhaps the most critical piece of information is that the Trump Campaign knew that the DNC emails were going to be released before they were. They had an active, multi-pronged plan in place to capitalize off the communications stolen by the Russian government. 5/\\nMueller found that Donald Trump, himself, knew that Wikileaks had the DNC emails before they were released and was in contact with campaign members and people outside of campaign and planned how to capitalize off their release. 6/\\nTrump\\'s call for Russia to find Clinton\\'s emails was fruitful. Within hours they followed his call and worked to find them. Despite saying it was just a TV stunt, he repeated the call off-camera. It was collusion in real time and in the light of public. No other way to say it 7/\\nAs for the Trump Tower meeting, Mueller believed that Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner committed crimes, but worried that courts would lose the thread on legal definition of the crime and wasn\\'t sure what the $ value of Clinton dirt was and if it was enough. 8/\\nPaul Manafort was especially lousy in the collusion front. He obviously had financial incentive and discussed battleground states with Russian individual, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, leading to suspicion that there were targeted efforts or interference. 9/\\nManafort discussing battleground states with Russia is really, really unsettling. There\\'s a ton of new ground here to cover and who knows what it led to and what can be proven. You could make an argument that this is possible what turned the election. 10/\\nIn terms of obstruction, it is quite obvious that Mueller was communicating that there were SEVERAL instances of obstruction, SEVERAL instances of attempted obstruction, and that Congress should address the issue. 11/\\nTrump actively wanted Mueller out of the investigation, said as much repeatedly. He wanted to fire him and worried that his appointment would be \"the end\" of his presidency. 12/\\nTrump repeatedly told his subordinates to obstruct justice. He had them contact the principals, including Comey and Flynn, in order to take their temperature and communicate what Trump thought. It was a giant game of illegal telephone. 13/\\nTrump repeatedly would call Comey, take his temperature, and try and get him to take it easy on Flynn. He had Reince Priebus contact Flynn, take his temperature, seemingly try and work him in order to keep his loyalty. 14/\\nMultiple people in Trump\\'s orbit declined to perform actions they thought were obstruction, including Chris Christie, who counseled Trump on how to not obstruct justice and watched him do it anyway. 15/\\nAfter it was revealed that Mike Flynn had illicit contact with Russia, Trump shook his hand and told him he\\'d be taken care of. It seems as if the exchange was a promise that Trump would help him with the fallout. 16/\\nTrump continually and actively addressed those in his orbit to either lie or coverup what they\\'d done wrong. He was constantly worried people would roll on him and constantly sought to get their stories straight in case of investigation. 17/\\nIn a bizarre situation, Trump said outloud that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him. He said he believed the AG position wasn\\'t independent. He wanted an individual who would \"protect him\" and wouldn\\'t mind keeping him illegal informed of investigations 18/\\nTrump knew that false testimony had been provided, particularly in Cohen\\'s case. He was aware of a crime being committed and allowed it. 19/\\nTrump wanted to obstruct even more than he did, but the only thing keeping him from doing so was that those around him didn\\'t want to be accessories to a crime. Don McGahn said he wanted him to do \"crazy shit\" and refused. 20/\\nNow, the big, big, big takeaways. Mueller wrote this report in such a way as to send a message that the investigation was not the end all be all of this matter. It\\'s obvious he was keenly aware that there was still much work to do in regards to both collusion and obstruction 21/\\nIn collusion, Mueller repeatedly mentions that he was hindered by the Trump team either lying or else not providing information. He said they destroyed evidence and stonewalled him. That\\'s why he couldn\\'t establish the charge in totality. 22/\\nIn terms of obstruction, Mueller was clearly putting the matter in the hands of Congress. This is a full and explicit layout of impeachable, high crimes. He was not intending Barr to steamroll over this thing. Not at all. 23/\\nWhat\\'s more, Barr not only lied, it appears he actively obstructed justice by misrepresenting the report in his summary. This wasn\\'t just a partisan structuring, it was an attempt to try and save Donald Trump and the administration. 24/\\nWhat William Barr did here is beyond disgusting and beyond shameful. He should be removed from office and there should be ramifications. This is, to put it bluntly, a massive and indefensible act of cover-up a systematic and overwhelming crime. 25/\\nThe Trump Campaign and the Trump Organization are criminal enterprises. The only difference between them and the infamous \"mob\" is that their crimes are explicitly white collar and international in nature. They acted with an intention to commit crimes, over and over. 26/\\nIt\\'s impossible to read this report and not notice how careful they were to skirt the line of collusion and obstruction. They were obviously aware of what they were doing and that this is even a matter of discussion is an indictment of our political and judicial system. 27/\\nThis last thing, I want to preface by saying I don\\'t say this lightly. It makes me unbelievably sad and depressed that this has happened. But we have a criminal president and he must be removed. It has to happen. 28/\\nFrom the moment Donald Trump announced his campaign he engaged in one unethical and criminal act after another. It\\'s in black and white that he and the people around him are happy traitors who put their wealth and power above the country\\'s wellbeing. 29/\\nTrump and his cronies made a decision to put power and wealth above the country. They actively sought help in undermining our democratic process. They didn\\'t report constant Russian contacts or offers to help. They\\'re traitors. That\\'s it. They\\'re traitors. 30/\\nWe can sit here and parse out legal definitions, but I don\\'t know how you get to anything else. We can talk about the word collusion or obstruction, but they actively sought help from a foreign adversary to interfere in the election of the Presidency of the United States. 31/\\nThe House of Representatives must vote to impeach Donald Trump. I don\\'t care if it won\\'t carry out in the Senate. It\\'s what impeachment exists to do. It\\'s their constitutional obligation to impeach him for high crimes. 32/\\nRepublicans have a duty to remove Donald Trump from office. They can hide behind partisanship all they want, but it\\'s right here in the open that he\\'s betrayed the company and broken the laws. They need to realize that duty is higher than party. And it needs to happen now. 33/\\nWe are in a crisis. We have to recognize that. Right now, we have a criminally compromised president. If he\\'s allowed to get through this unscathed, we\\'re never, ever going back. This is a four-alarm fire and we have to treat it as such. \\n\\nRight. Now. 34/\\nThere\\'s no defending this. There\\'s no spinning it. There\\'s no rebuttal that can put this away. This is a massive and unbelievable crime on a scale before unseen. We need to get rid of the Trump Presidency before it destroys us, before it rots us from the inside out. 35/\\nI take literally no pleasure from this. I\\'m extremely, extremely disheartened that a crime like this could take place on a scale this large. I really, really wish this would\\'ve been a hoax or a witch hunt, but it\\'s massive in scope and consequence. Trump has to go. 36/36',\n",
       " 'hilo 384': '1) I’m amused to see @JonahNRO scrambling for higher ground amid the insane tide of nutjob conspiracism that has overtaken the Right in the age of Trump. Amused, because Goldberg had no small role in conjuring up that tide, and still does. Thread follows.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/P3c4Xr6jkI\\n2) In addition to his role as editor of National Review’s online presence, Goldberg also has been living, ideologically speaking, from his book written a decade ago, ‘Liberal Fascism.’ I had a brief to-and-fro with him regarding its veracity at the time:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Mnaq704Hqm\\n3) I also organized a group of historians who actually specialize in fascism and put their essays together in a project at History News Network, to which Goldberg also responded (see links to all pieces at bottom of this intro):\\n\\nhttps://t.co/BlYXY1VfRW\\n4) One of Goldberg’s favorites tactics in responding to critics was to affect a high-minded superiority to his interlocutors, who were simply too stupid to comprehend the profound intellectual heights to which he clearly believed he had climbed.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/YTEhNOV06l\\n5) His critics made clear that his thesis – that “fascism is a phenomenon of the left, not the right” – is rubbish, reflecting eagerness to embrace fascists’ own propaganda while ignoring the recorded history of their actions, distinct from their words.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/AUJ8qgFF4e\\n5) One of the points he loved to repeat when promoting the book was that, well, he wasn’t saying all liberals were fascists and all fascists liberals, but rather he was just making a point so convoluted it became a nonsequitur. It’s right in the text: https://t.co/utmbBEiSor\\n6) Yet even as he made these and similar claims, he was appearing on right-wing shows promoted by pundits who in fact were quite eager to claim that all liberals or progressives were fascists. Foremost among these was Glenn Beck.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/I9iSr7liyg\\n7) Goldberg appeared on Beck’s show multiple times to promote ‘Liberal Fascism.’ With Goldberg there in the studio, Beck proceeded to claim that the progressive movement was fascist in its origins and in its behavior today. Bailouts were fascist. Health-care reform was fascist.\\nAt no point did Jonah demur. Indeed, he joined right in.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/kPrPI8vlrr\\n8) Eventually Beck produced a ‘documentary’ based on Goldberg’s book he titled ‘Live Free or Die’ that called the progressive movement a ‘cancer’ and blamed progressives for every genocide of the 20th century.\\nhttps://t.co/xeHqk99S8E\\nhttps://t.co/LtHOPyjL9x\\n9) At one point, Goldberg and Beck got together and counted all the ways that progressives and fascists were the exact same thing:\\nhttps://t.co/F58HArJPoQ\\n10) Flash forward nine years, and guess what? @DineshDSouza has cobbled together another right-wing bestseller that essentially replicates and updates Goldberg’s thesis. It’s titled ‘The Big Lie,’ and it features antifascists on the cover because they’re the _real_ fascists. https://t.co/4eSS0a3cQe\\n11) D’Souza doesn’t even attempt to demur with high-mindedness as Goldberg does. He nakedly calls Democrats ‘the real fascists’ and equates today’s liberals with 1920s Klansmen, which even Goldberg knew better than to attempt. (He just dismissed the KKK as a crazy movie fan club.\\n12) It came out two weeks before Charlottesville. And of course, everyone on TV that weekend saw the real dynamic we face: White nationalists bearing swastikas and Dixie flags, chanting Nazi slogans and Trump’s name and wearing MAGA hats, all battling black-clad antifascists.\\n13) This year, rather hilariously, D’Souza is hoping he can convince everyone that’s not what they really saw. With a new movie (‘Death of a Nation’) out in theaters spouting his thesis that Democrats are the real Nazis, D’Souza is gaslighting us.\\n14) He’s actually attempting to persuade everyone that what they’re seeing in Charlottesville this weekend is just two warring leftist factions. Seriously.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/x827A31OTI\\n15) Which is kind of undermined by all the Confederate flags and MAGA hats the organizers’ side like to carry. This year in DC it was American flags. Oh, and the fact that they named it “Unite the Right.” https://t.co/E0qlbKyPJz\\n16) I’ve covered a number of the right-wing Patriot Prayer events here on the West Coast, which lately have been featuring the violently pro-Trump hate group Proud Boys as their main muscle. They carry Trump banners. They make right-wing pronouncements. They are NOT leftists. https://t.co/XeFE5YWPLc\\n17) All this comes back to the point I raised with Jonah lo these many years ago, to wit: If we’re going to discuss fascism in America, oughtn’t we consider and examine the organizations that are expressly fascist and have mostly existed on the fringe of our politics since WWII?\\n18) There were openly fascist groups that operated in the 1920s and ‘30s, such as William Dudley Pelley’s Silver Shirts. Their direct descendants included William Potter Gale and Mike Beach, founders of the Posse Comitatus, and early neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell. https://t.co/6jKyDxTA0K\\n19) This fringe remained very much alive through the 1970s and 1980s thanks to movements like the Klan revival led by David Duke and the violent neo-Nazi skinheads. https://t.co/EWLlXEwzvH\\n20] They reshaped themselves a couple of ways in the 1990s as Patriot militiamen (essentially a version of white supremacist ideology rebranding and remaking its image for mainstream consumption) and pseudo-academic white nationalists of the Jared Taylor/American Renaissance ilk.\\n21) Today’s alt-right and militia “III Percent” movements, as well as the Alex Jones conspiracism that fuels all of these elements and provides them with their shared epistemological bubble, are direct products of these movements.\\n22) All of them are, and always have been, definably right-wing movements. There is nothing remotely left-wing about them, and never has been. D’Souza’s risible claims to the contrary notwithstanding.\\n23) These are the shoals of hard factual and historical reality upon which these revisionist attempts to reimagine fascism as somehow a left-wing phenomenon run aground.  They look frankly ridiculous when confronted with the presence of actual American fascists today.\\n24) Example: Patriot Front, the neo-Nazis who’ve been spreading fliers in your neighborhoods. They are explicit fascists who even use a fasces as their symbol. One of the fliers reads: ‘Making America Safe For Fascism Again.’\\n\\nhttps://t.co/iVpLzzEMjW\\n(More here.)\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Jj7jLeyScf\\n26) When not promoting the idea of fascism, the rest of the Patriot Front agenda is straight out of D’Souza’s own list of top favorite subjects: Stopping immigration, defending “western civilization,” attacking LGBT rights, attacking nonwhite civil rights and hate-crime laws.\\n27) So when he tries to claim that these are somehow “radical leftists,” he just looks stupid and foolish. But you know, that’s his call.\\n28) 25) This is, in fact, the point I made to Goldberg in my original review of  ‘Liberal Fascism’ for The American Prospect:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/iCmXlkNEXh https://t.co/JevZpmBCda\\n29) Goldberg was never able to provide a good reply. Rather, he just dismissed it with the immortal line: “Who gives a rat’s ass about the Posse Comitatus?”\\n\\nhttps://t.co/ZfXIjW1ZEd\\n30) Now Goldberg wants us to believe that, while the rest of movement conservatism appears to have been inundated by the tide of Trumpist insanity, there are still a few good old reliable _real_ conservatives rising above it all.\\n31) Yet at the same time, he himself is responsible for having unleashed much of this same insanity. Indeed, he not only gave rise to D’Souza’s crackpottery, he continues to endorse it himself, quite avidly:\\nhttps://t.co/fuL04i6kDE\\n32) He’s been called out for it by other conservatives, too:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/5oULoDGf2H\\n33) So just remember, when you hear Jonah moan about the difficulty of being a “good” conservative these days, that this is the same man who actively made the ugly little bed in which he now has to sleep – and he still give it a nice plumping daily.',\n",

       " 'hilo 386': 'Thread: On @POTUS\\'s Upcoming State Visit and the UK\\n\\n1. There is much intrigue in the air as @POTUS’s state visit to the UK approaches. Will he pressure the Brits to come clean publicly on their #Spygate complicity?\\n2. Will the Queen attempt a “charm offensive” in order to persuade him to not release any declassified #Spygate-related information that may incriminate British intelligence?\\n3. I find it particularly interesting that the Conservative Party’s house organ, the Daily Telegraph, published an article to try to get out ahead of the #Spygate revelations before the state visit. \\n\\n&lt;quote&gt;\\n4. Theresa May’s spy chiefs were secretly briefed on an explosive dossier of claims about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia before the US president was made aware of its existence, The Telegraph can reveal.\\n5. The heads of MI5 and MI6 and one of Mrs. May’s most trusted security advisers were told about former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele’s memos on the Trump campaign in the weeks after his November 2016 election victory.\\n\\n&lt;unquote&gt;\\n\\nSource: https://t.co/26pOmXRpkJ\\n6. “The Telegraph can reveal.” Why do you supposed they waited until just last Sunday to publish this article when surely the facts were known months ago – if not from the very beginning?\\n7. Always remember: the UK Deep State has been at it MUCH longer that the US Deep State. They’ve perfected an “us-versus-them” mentality in a society that was never classless to begin with. The UK’s political class and Deep State are where our political class takes its clues.\\n8. The UK Deep State is globalist-minded; so is the American political class. The UK is for “free trade” at the expense of their own people; so is the American political class. The UK has “socialized medicine” – and the attendant shortages in care – for decades; ….\\n8A. … the American political class (esp. the Democrats) have pushed Obamacare down our throats as a waystation on the road to a US-version of government-run medicine.\\n9. The UK has been on the anthropogenic global warming bandwagon from the very beginning. That’s where many of the first bogus climate models and databases were developed to influence political discourse on the subject; the American political class has followed their lead.\\n10. The UK political class has been rolling over for the Muslim invasion for years due to foolishly handing out British passports to virtually anyone from the old British Empire; who can deny that that’s essentially what the American political class has been doing in recent yrs?\\n11. There are townships in the UK that are no-go zones in which Sharia law dictates local rules. Here is one consequence of that invasion:\\n\\n&lt;quote&gt;\\n12. The UK tops even Sweden in Europe’s sexual assault and rape statistics. At 130.96 per 100,000 for sexual assaults and 50.68 per 100,000 for rapes, the United Kingdom is the most dangerous place for women in Europe.\\n13. One analysis claims that 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted and that 3.1% of women were assaulted in just the last year.\\n14. But then why do the numbers for nearby Ireland look so strikingly different? Like Finland, Ireland’s numbers are high, but nowhere near as high as those in the United Kingdom.\\n15. The UK’s sexual assault and rape rates are roughly four times as high as those of Ireland. And at 6.3% versus 1.4%, the difference in Muslim population percentages is in almost perfect proportion.\\n16. London, with its great diversity, has the highest rape rate within the United Kingdom.\\n\\n&lt;unquote&gt;\\n\\nRead the rest here: https://t.co/nx1stLEdUK\\n17. We’re moving in that direction in Somali-controlled areas of St. Paul, MN. Ask yourself how in the world did their come to be 74,000 Somalis in the Twin Cities area in the middle of America – except by Deep State design? One consequence? Ilhan Omar!\\nhttps://t.co/Zy9aUP6xIy\\n18. All the manifestations of the UK Deep State are mirrored and imitated by the American political class, including the implementation of double standards in the application of the rule of law, as well as the weaponization of government institutions against the people.\\n19. UK disdain for the US, as well as British meddling in US politics is not a new phenomenon. For example, Winston Churchill has been glorified in recent movies (The Darkest Hour is a really good picture, and Gary Oldman gave his best performance ever!).\\nhttps://t.co/xXvCNhmN5h\\n20. But there is another side of Churchill that has been hidden from public view to perpetuate the myth – his deep-seated enmity toward the US. A recent biographer of his was the first person to gain access to King George VI\\'s wartime diaries in the Royal Archives.\\n\\n&lt;quote&gt;\\n21. Although he had enjoyed his first trip to the United States in 1895, at age 20, Churchill’s initial attitude toward Anglo-American unity was sarcastic, bordering on the facetious.\\n22. In the 1920s, Churchill was highly critical of the United States’ determination to build a fleet equal in power and tonnage to the Royal Navy’s.\\n23. “There can really be no parity between a power whose navy is its life and a power whose navy is only for prestige,” he wrote in a secret cabinet memorandum in June 1927, while he was chancellor of the exchequer.\\n24. “It always seems to be assumed that it is our duty to humour the United States and minister to their vanity. They do nothing for us in return but exact their last pound of flesh.”\\n25. [H]is hostility to America was not known beyond the cognoscenti inside government, as he assiduously kept it out of his many speeches.\\n26. Churchill was clearly jealous of the leading position the Americans had assumed through their vastly superior production of war materiel by the spring of 1943.\\n27. “Winston is keen on an Imperial Conference,” the king noted that April, “so as to discuss the question of putting up a united British Commonwealth and Empire front to show the world and USA that we are one unity.”\\n28. “The Americans are always saying they are going to lead the postwar world.” \\n\\n&lt;unquote&gt;\\n\\nThere is more here: https://t.co/ezjJJ3KdKp\\n29. This secret bias perhaps begins to explain Churchill\\'s unqualified backing for the hyper-egotist and flaming asshole Field Marshal Montgomery against American Supreme Allied Commander GEN Dwight Eisenhower in major decision points for the prosecution of the War.\\n30. Churchill also appears to have had strong opinions about FDR’s socialist domestic politics and naive fondness for the \"heroic\" Stalin and the USSR.\\n31. Churchill also is controversial and less than fondly remembered by many Australians, who deeply resent the mass slaughter of their troops in Churchill\\'s flawed strategy and incompetent execution of the Gallipoli campaign against the Turkish Straits in 1915.\\n32. Some Aussies to this day call senior levels of British military and political leadership \"Pompies\" – a diminutive pejorative for \"Pompous Assholes\" (or \"Buffoons\").\\n33. The point of this is to remind us that the Brits may be long-standing allies, but they are not necessarily our friends. They have practiced realpolitick for centuries and are motivated by what best serves Britain (frequently at America’s expense!).\\n34. Getting back to @POTUS’s upcoming state visit, I have no doubt that the Brits wish to keep their intel agencies’ involvement in #Spygate secret, as that would blow the roof off both countries’ Deep State and political class collectives.\\n35. The Brit Deep State is trying desperately to keep the UK inside the EU, and an eruption of the complicity of UK intel agencies meddling in US politics would be an unwelcome diversion (to say the least!).\\n36. Prime Minister Theresa May has already been forced to resign (effective 7 June), and there are at least five candidates who are angling to be her replacement. I strongly believe that she will become the scapegoat for “UK Spygate” if/when the whole story goes public.\\n37. That will be her penance for having been the UK Deep State’s PM since 2016. And the UK will attempt preserve the “special relationship” with the US as best they can.\\n38. I’m not so sure that @POTUS will be very forgiving. In my opinion, he has a very welcome streak of vengeance and payback in him. I look forward to seeing how Trumpenfreude will be visited on the Brits, don’t you?  ///The end.',\n",
       " 'hilo 387': \"Let’s talk about Russia, because I think there’s a real cultural difference in how we in the West understand surveillance and what’s actually happening with Russian efforts so we have a hard time believing the depth of what’s going on.\\nMy parents are diplomats and they were posted to Russia. Before they left they deleted all social media and told my sister and I that the Russians would be watching us. My mum does property management stuff and my dad does tech and communications stuff.\\nIt sounds fancy, but basically my dad is the guy that you call when your printer isn’t working, and he does things like make sure firewalls are up and people are trained on new software. Mum figures out who’s gonna live where and gets them their furniture. Not high ranking stuff.\\nOne day mum looked up and saw a new smoke detector in the bedroom of their apartment in Moscow. Since she’s the property person, she would’ve known about a new smoke detector being installed in anyone’s unit. She would’ve organized it. This one was different from the others.\\nIt appeared magically. She had never organized this new smoke detector. There was no reason for it to be there. Cause it was installed by Russian surveillance. It wasn’t a smoke detector. Except at this point they’re so used to it she’s like “ugh, spies. Whatever.”\\nOne of her juniors came home early to her apartment one day to find four dudes sitting around her kitchen table playing cards. They wouldn’t talk when she asked who they were. They packed up and left and one of them shrugged at her on the way out.\\nAnother woman who worked with her got upset about her clothes in her dresser always being messed up when she knew she folded them. One day she said outloud “if you guys are gonna spy on me can’t you at least tidy up or something?” Next day when she came home her dishes were done.\\nOn the internet in 1998-1999 Russian citizens were generally very democratic and varied. In 2000 suddenly 60-80% of comments reflected totalitarian views. This is attributed to “web brigades” formed by the Russian State Security Service.\\nOh, you need historical context for this to really sink in. Putin was first named Prime Minister in August 1999, he was unpopular and not well known. A bunch of apartments were bombed and it was blamed on the Chechens. Putin used this to position himself as a strong leader.\\nYeltsin (Russian President at the time) announces his resignation on New Year’s Eve 1999. Putin is acting President up until the election in March. Putin ran almost no campaign and received 1/3 of all the media coverage, though there were 12 candidates for president. He won.\\nPutin is President from 2000-2008. Then he goes back to being Prime Minister until 2012, then he goes back to being President. Before all this he was a foreign intelligence officer until 1991 when he entered politics. He became Director of the Federal Security Service in 1998.\\nFederal Security Service (FSB) is responsible for internal security of the Russian state, counterintelligence, terrorism, etc. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies work under the FSB if necessary.\\nSo back to those web brigades in 2000. Organized and overseen by Russian State Security, also known as the FSB. Also known as the successor to the KGB.

when, and for what purpose? dim the light, boy, and let\\'s tread soft, for i like this not\"\\nas we crept upstairs, i began to share the old man\\'s misgivings. an occasional flicker betrayed a light ahead of us, and we could hear sounds - a steady tapping, like a marble against glass, and more unnerving still, what might have been low voices somewhere ahead\\nwe came to a ledge and a ladder. by now the light and low voices were palpable. i rested a little while to sketch the arrangement, then me and the old man crept forward on our bellies to assess our situation. https://t.co/bYcNsrdZFj\\nwe could hear two voices very distinct. \"damn you, captain blake\", said the first roughly, \"and damn your tales of silver. i didn\\'t sign on with you to labour down some sewer like a navvy. where\\'s this famous jade skull you promised, eh?\"\\nthe second voice responded in an insinuating purr. \"while i\\'m captain, dick, you\\'ll do as i say. wasn\\'t it all as the bald man\\'s chart predicted? didn\\'t that lead us, plain as day, to the cataract and the hidden door? stow your tongue, then, dick burstock, stow your tongue\"\\nthe old man crouching by me was trembling with excitement. \"smugglers!\" he whispered fiercely, on what seemed to me very inadequate evidence\\nthe old man signalled with a flick of his wrist, we dropped back a little to talk through our next steps.\\n\\n\"the captain mentioned a bald man\\'s chart\", said the old man. \"we need to get our hands on that chart. i\\'ll make a distraction, boy; then hie you to the captain\\'s trunk\"\\nwithout waiting for my reply, he dipped for a stone; then flung it, with more force than i\\'d imagined he was capable of. captain blake was standing alongside an antique candelabra, its top candles lit - all three candles went flying into the straw. the captain roared\\nthat was my signal. ducking through the shadows, i ran past capt. blake and dick burstock battling furiously with the flames, up to the captain\\'s concealed trunk. luckily it had been left unlocked. buried in the linings was the chart we sought.\\ni tried to run back the way i came. but dick burstock had turned from the fire to find water, and caught sight of my shirt-tails. \"Oi!\" he screamed, running to intercept me. my escape cut off, i doubled back, vaulting a pair of barrels and diving down a passageway\\nthe furious dick burstock was in hot pursuit; but luck of a sort was with me. i collided with a lever, which sent a portcullis tumbling down to block his path. i was away, and i had the chart, but i was cut off from my guide and in a strange place\\nhaving no lantern i guided myself with my phone\\'s torch; aware, however, that the battery would not last long. \"if there\\'s a path upwards i\\'ll take it\", i thought, and hummed a verse of \\'silver\\'s the blood of the moon, the moon\\'\\nbut the passageway showed no signs of turning upwards, although it seemed to widen, and the stonework seemed to become rougher. stranger still, i could hear a sound which reminded me of a tide lapping the shore. i rounded a corner and a curious sight indeed confronted me\\nit was what i can only describe as the strand of an underground ocean. the roof of the passageway suddenly lifted up very substantially; high up in it, I could see veins of silver picked out like constellations. the water stretched away further than i could see.\\nhauled up onto the shore was a sailing vessel, a death\\'s head flag hoisted from the mizzen-mast. \"so it was this which carried captain blake and dick burstock here\", i said to myself. there was a campfire smouldering alongside the boat; i moved the teakettle into place above it.\\ni needed to think carefully. my intention was to push out in the boat and seek a further shore. but what were my responsibilities to the old man? if he hadn\\'t been discovered, would he be able to make his own way back down the passage to our \"diggins\", and from thence the shop?\\nand then, what if he *had* been discovered? surely it was my responsibility to assist him. but how? the knife on captain blake\\'s belt proclaimed him a deft close-quarters opponent; i had no weapon, and doubted my strength. \"what would gayle do\", i wondered\\nthere was another consideration; if i went back and rescued the old man, it seemed inevitable that blake and burstock would be able to regain the boat. this, perhaps, was our only chance to get a jump on the ruffians. \"forgive me, old man\", i whispered as i pushed off the boat\\nhaving made my decision, i explored the boat. there were two cabins; one, cramped and filthy, clearly belonged to the wretched burstock; the other, velveteen and luxurious, to none other than captain blake. i stowed my gear in the captain\\'s cabin and headed up to take the wheel\\na very large nugget of silver in the \"roof\" - some hundred metres above me - provided enough light to steer by. i hoisted the mainsail and the prow cut through the water, crisp and easy\\ni set my course in the direction which seemed most promising, and then unfurled the bald man\\'s chart. i could plainly see the \\'cataract\\' and the \\'hidden door\\' the captain had mentioned. more puzzling was the sketch in the bottom corner of an ominous creature https://t.co/36HdoJ8obX',\n",

If they also had access to health data (which I think they did), they could target people with mental illness.\\nMicrotargeting is achieved by uploading a custom audience to the Facebook ad manager - meaning, after they\\'ve found all the ppl in say, Pennsylvania who\\'ve used the word n***er in their private messages, they separate these people from everyone else.\\nThen they run ads targeting these people and only these people.  They don\\'t have to waste money casting a wide net and seeing what sticks.  They already know what will stick.\\nThen, with a pixel (basically, a tracker placed on a website), they can see if the person has visited the sites they\\'ve linked to.  They could see if these people were sharing stories, liking, clicking, or commenting.\\nAnd they could target these people over and over and over and over: because you can then create ANOTHER custom audience based on behaviors from your FIRST custom audience.\\nThey could have Trump coordinate his messaging in speeches with what was being run in these ads, and what was being covered on the news - all the news, not just Fox - 24/7 because, ratings.\\nRemember how Trump kicked off his campaign with disgusting comments about Mexican human beings?  What he said to Megyn Kelly on live TV?  He was talking to his custom audience, all cued up in the Facebook ads manager, and ready to go.\\n(by the way, people on the far left were targeted too)\\nContinuing: they achieved social proof with an army of trolls and bots who made it look like many other people agreed with these extreme ideas, and look like the fake news was legitimate.  The trolls and bots shared the links, made comments on fake and legitimate news articles.\\nTrolls even created fake events and attempted to create situations in which violence would erupt (and then be covered extensively, and used to further push the narrative of ppl of color and/or on the left being thugs).\\nSocial proof was solidified, and Cambridge Analytica got to refine their stolen data even more, by luring vulnerable people into private groups where they could ask them questions and encourage them to take action.\\nIn the end, it was 70,000 people - people with a specific psychological profile, which they had access to because they\\'d stolen it - who swung key states.\\nIf you think this is impossible, consider that companies convince people on a daily basis to leave their homes and buy a $30,000 car.  WITHOUT stolen data about the most intimate parts of their lives.\\nAnd WITHOUT these people being afraid that their very lives depend on buying a car/going to McDonald\\'s/shopping at Walmart-Mart.\\nI\\'d posit that the rest were filled in by people who told everyone \"he doesn\\'t mean what he\\'s saying\" and stood to gain the most from what Trump was promising: rich, white straight men.\\nAnd they just got what they were promised - a giant cash grab that goes against what every so-called conservative has said they believe in.\\nAnd let\\'s not forget the far religious right!  See: Council for National Policy.\\nThere was a reason Trump had little to no ad spend in other areas of media, like TV.  He didn\\'t need it.  They had a STOLEN profile of just about every single American - likely down to their bowel movements - and used those profiles to manipulate those who were vulnerable.\\nSo, in summary, this is a BFD.  And it was only ONE of the things they were doing, as we\\'re finding out. ||END||\\nSorry, just wanted to add one more thing.  This is another important question we need to ask: who ELSE has this data now? and WTF are they doing to us with it?\\nIf you haven\\'t read or watched the stories, Facebook didn\\'t ask CA to do anything about the stolen data until August of 2016 - YEARS after it had happened.  Even then, they didn\\'t follow up, AND the named source (Wylie) has stated that this data was EMAILED, UNENCRYPTED.\\nLooks like the NRA works with Cambridge Analytica.

       " 'hilo 391': '(THREAD) New evidence suggests Rick Gates\\' plea has much more to do with Russia than we thought.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s because it may have more to do with Trump advisor Erik Prince and Trump fundraiser/RNC deputy finance chair Elliott Broidy than we thought.\\n\\nHope you\\'ll read on and share. https://t.co/TGqLdgXmx9\\n1/ When Gates pleaded guilty, the White House insisted his crimes had nothing to do with Trump or Russia. But it\\'s increasingly clear the reason Mueller offered Gates a plea deal did in fact have to do with Russia-related information Gates had about not just Manafort but others.\\n2/ First, understand how significant Gates was to Trump\\'s campaign: he was its Deputy Campaign Manager; he ran its operations at the RNC, where Trump campaign aides made contact with Russian nationals and subsequently changed the RNC platform to benefit Putin and lied about it...\\n3/ ...per media reports, he was effectively running Trump\\'s campaign—more so than Manafort—for several months in the summer of 2016; when Manafort was fired, Trump stayed in contact with his former Campaign Manager and declined to fire Gates, instead giving him a critical role...\\n4/ ...as his campaign\\'s liaison to the RNC, a move which at the time surprised political observers because (a) that was a critical campaign role, and (b) it was assumed that Gates, Manafort\\'s deputy, would\\'ve been removed from the campaign at the same time Manafort was because...\\n5/ ...like Manafort, Gates had ties to the Ukraine and therefore should\\'ve been as big a liability as Manafort was—by then—thought to be, at least publicly; Trump then made him Deputy Chairman of his inaugural committee (a key role) during the transition, which we now know was...\\n6/ ...lousy with secret meetings and calls with Russian nationals—even as Trump (and, one presumes, let\\'s be honest, Gates as well) stayed in touch with Manafort behind the scenes (and of course Trump and Manafort lived in the same building and could meet up whenever they liked).\\n7/ So Gates was at the top of Trump\\'s campaign and transition; was at the top of the campaign and transition at all points at which suspicious Trump-Russia contact occurred; and was definitively tied to that contact, at least in terms of the lied-about platform change at the RNC.\\n8/ But Trump\\'s decision not to fire Gates in mid-2016, but put him in a key position as the link between himself and the RNC, never sat right with me, or with many others in the media. Gates came in with Manafort and had all the same liabilities; so why didn\\'t he go out with him?\\n9/ Indeed, Trump responded to the *loss* of Manafort (against Trump\\'s wishes, and only in public, to be clear) by *promoting* Manafort\\'s equally compromised deputy to a position of even *greater* prominence and power than he had before—which he stayed in through the inauguration.\\n10/ And now Rick Gates has pleaded guilty.\\n\\nImmediately after that happened, sources in the White House successfully got the media to pass on (essentially without analysis) two lies: (a) Gates wasn\\'t a particularly prominent Trump-campaign figure; (b) he\\'d no knowledge of Russia.\\n11/ But you know who Gates was linked up with as a result of Trump shocking the media and naming him his RNC liaison? The man pictured atop this thread, Elliott Brody, who less than 90 days after Gates ceased to be Trump\\'s RNC liaison became the deputy finance chair of the RNC.\\n12/ Days after Gates was indicted, McClatchy reported Mueller was looking into new charges against Gates involving a shady film-production scheme. As part of that scheme, two producers sent $100K in fraudulently-obtained funds to a nonprofit run by Broidy. https://t.co/icEmpkKN2f\\n13/ That wasn\\'t the first time Gates was involved with Broidy: Broidy was Vice Chairman of the Trump Victory Committee during the 2016 campaign, a joint operation between Trump and the RNC, which linkage therefore—per Trump\\'s surprising summer promotion of Gates—was run by Gates.\\n14/ As soon as the campaign ended, Gates and Broidy continued working together, this time on Trump\\'s inaugural committee—for which Broidy was the Vice Chairman and Gates the Deputy Chairman. So the compromised-by-Ukraine-cash Gates was hand in glove with Broidy for *many* months.\\n15/ And after he worked with the compromised-by-Ukraine-cash Gates for many months, Broidy was rewarded by the RNC with a promotion of his own—to deputy finance chairman. So Trump saw to Rick Gates\\' elevation, and the RNC saw to Broidy\\'s. Both sides of that partnership prospered.\\n16/ Three weeks ago, a story dropped suggesting that Broidy\\'s wife was trying to collect millions of dollars in return for influencing Trump Administration policy. https://t.co/G2LywcD580\\n17/ Two days later, the George Nader news dropped—Nader, a Trump insider-turned-Mueller-informant, established that Erik Prince had lied about his Trump-sanctioned secret meeting with a Russian in the Seychelles—and Nader was immediately tied to Broidy too.https://t.co/AAdmt9y45v\\n18/ Lest you wonder if Broidy is only connected to Nader, not Prince, understand first that Broidy is in the same niche industry as Prince—private Middle East military contractors—specifically in the UAE, which is where Prince lives. He\\'s tied to the UAE royal family—like Prince.\\n19/ But wait! I\\'m just getting warmed up. Just four days after the Broidy-Nader scandal (which itself was two days after Broidy\\'s wife\\'s scandal), this bombshell dropped: Broidy was possibly connected to a scandal involving (wait for it) Russian sanctions. https://t.co/PEHVGrzchd\\n20/ According to docs held by a Ukrainian prosecutor, Broidy has been acting as an agent of a sanctioned Kremlin-owned bank—in other words, the Kremlin. And the media reports Broidy has \"significant access to Trump\" and is lobbying him. On what? Why, Russian sanctions, of course.\\n21/ That\\'s right, Broidy appears to be lobbying Trump to do just what Trump has done: slow or avoid the imposition of any new Russian sanctions, and militate publicly for an end to all sanctions on Russian entities. Thank god there\\'s no evidence that Broidy is giving Trump money!\\n22/ (Surely, if you\\'re reading this, you know what\\'s coming next.)\\n23/ Broidy has been a major Trump fundraiser since 2016, and the money sure didn\\'t stop flowing once (allegedly) Broidy began working for both the RNC and—apparently—Putin\\'s VTB Bank.\\n\\nOne week ago Broidy hosted a $35,000-a-person fundraiser (!) for Trump. https://t.co/y995863cZw\\n24/ The Al-Jazeera investigation linked to in this thread implies that Mueller now could be investigating Broidy—who, again, apparently has shady ties to both the Kremlin, the RNC, Ukraine, Erik Prince, and the UAE—for FARA violations and more. And who could help him? Rick Gates.\\n25/ (I wish I could tell you this thread is about to get *less* complicated, but it\\'s about to get *more* complicated. But also *absolutely stunning*.)\\n26/ Trump (and Jared) are surrounded by a horde of fundraisers and advisors who are trying to lobby Trump not just about private military contractors in the Middle East but, more significantly, about *nuclear power* in the Middle East.\\n\\nSpecifically, gifts of U.S. nuclear tech.\\n27/ Rick Gates is part of that horde. And so is another man Mueller has in his pocket due to a plea: Michael Flynn.\\n\\nTrump pal Thomas Barrack is also in that horde. So is Bud McFarlane, who was a VIP at Trump\\'s Mayflower Speech in April 2016. So is Broidy. https://t.co/5cxOxnfL0f\\n28/ So now we have a story involving Gates, Flynn, Prince, Broidy, Barrack, McFarlane, Kushner, Nader, and Donald Trump. But guess what: it all comes back to Russia and the UAE, the two parties Prince secretly met with and lied about meeting with while under oath before Congress.\\n29/ If you read the ProPublica story, you\\'ll see the UAE can only get U.S. nuclear tech if we give it to Saudi Arabia first. Trump\\'s pals are all either working to get that tech to Saudi Arabia or lobbying on behalf of the UAE—which, as to nuclear tech, amounts to the same thing.\\n30/ What does this have to do with Putin and sanctions? That\\'s a reasonable question to ask.The answer: Moscow wants the contracts to build all new nuclear power plants in the Middle East, and stands to make *hundreds of millions* doing so.\\n\\nJust one thing stops them: sanctions.\\n31/ Yesterday the Saudi Crown Prince, who wants our nuclear tech, which would allow it to flow also to the UAE, which would make Putin hundreds of millions—but only if sanctions are dropped—said this about Jared Kushner: he\\'s \"in my pocket.\"\\n\\nProcess that. https://t.co/op1dN9MEM2\\n32/ Does this change your view of why Kushner secretly met the Russian ambassador at Trump Tower in December 2016—he smuggled him in the back door—to discuss setting up a secret backchanel to Putin? While Gates and Broidy were running the inaugural committee and lobbying Trump?\\n33/ Does this change your view of the pending (unanswered) question about where the \"extra\" tens of millions of dollars raised by Gates and Broidy for the inauguration went? https://t.co/qMTiAkPVRt\\n34/ Does this change your view of today\\'s news about Broidy allegedly helping Moscow companies lobby Trump on sanctions?\\n\\nDoes it change your view of whether Mueller wanted Gates under plea for reasons (as the White House says) entirely unrelated to Trump? https://t.co/uxrVkk6MoI\\n35/ Gates and Flynn have a lot to tell Mueller, and we should assume they\\'ve told all of it. We should further assume Broidy and Kushner are in Mueller\\'s path and that at least one will roll on Trump. We should assume all pending UAE-Saudi Arabia scandals are equally about Putin.\\n36/ I\\'ve said this from the day I first read Chris Steele\\'s dossier 14 months ago: Trump sold U.S. policy on Russia for money, and he did it before the campaign started (2013 in Moscow), during the campaign (his 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal) and while in office post-January 2017.\\n37/ Yesterday\\'s big news from the New York Times is of course part of all this, as it underscores that Trump\\'s clandestine arrangement with Moscow flowed (much if not all the time) through negotiations with the UAE and Saudi Arabia—often via his top aides. https://t.co/uGys0TGYdx\\n38/ Trump is toast. Not because he\\'s an asshole, though he is; not because he\\'s a Republican, which (in fact) he isn\\'t; he\\'s toast because he\\'s one of the biggest traitors in the history of the U.S. and Mueller has *at least* three key witnesses *already* who can testify to that.\\n39/ Now you know why Trump hired Joe DiGenova—who wanted Comey prosecuted and will pull the same BS on Mueller. You know why he\\'s hiring DiGenova\\'s wife Victoria, who spread the Uranium One hoax—he\\'s going to go after Clinton. You know why he hired Bolton—he\\'s going to go to war.\\n40/ Trump knows he\\'s toast, which is why he\\'s preparing for two wars: a war on the rule of law here at home, and a senseless war abroad, in either North Korea or Iran. All of it is to save himself—he thinks—by delaying what at this point is inevitable: his fall from power. {end}\\nUPDATE/ I was one of the louder voices online outlining why DiGenova and Toensing had too many conflicts to work with Trump—due to other Trump-Russia clients and DiGenova\\'s alleged role in blackmailing Comey to reopen the Clinton case. Well, look at this: https://t.co/VRDLud9wg1\\nNOTE1/ What Joe DiGenova and his wife are learning, which most of us lawyers learned in law school, is that a client can waive an *apparent* conflict of interest, but an *actual* conflict of interest must be avoided by a lawyer at all costs—per the Rules of Professional Conduct.\\nNOTE2/ Representing Clovis, Prince, and Corallo is an *actual* conflict of interest for DiGenova and his wife that can\\'t be waived by the clients and can\\'t be allowed by DiGenova and Toensing. Their clients (and they) have info on facts and strategy Trump wants and needs to know.\\nNOTE3/ When I say Trump is \"toast,\" please (I ask you) do *not* add the word \"imminently\" after it in your mind—as I didn\\'t say that and don\\'t believe it and am sick of being misquoted. The writing is on the wall for Trump, but it\\'ll take *many* months for this to come to a head.',\n",

Conflict over American whites bringing enslaved black people into Mexico, which had abolished slavery in 1829, was a factor in Texas seceding in 1845.\\nThe Texans were hardly alone in their attempts to stall Emancipation. When Northern states began abolishing slavery after the Revolutionary War, slaveholders would wait until shortly before the last day of legal slavery and then sell their Negroes to buyers in slave states.\\nIn other instances slavers simply moved across state lines, taking enslaved people out of a territory where Emancipation was occurring to one where slavery was protected.

But I also must point out that brow-beating and nagging is also work, and telling women to do more of it adds to women’s unfair work load.\\nThe reason women do more work is simple: Men force them into a binary choice. You either a) do the work all by yourself or b) nag him. Most of the time, A, while exhausting, is less exhausting than B, which makes you miserable as well as tired.\\nIn addition, men punish women for nagging. They withhold affection, mock women, and in worst case scenarios, abuse them. This is why I call it the “nagging differential” and it is, in my opinion, the main reason domestic labor differences persist.\\nThe problem here is a sticky one: The only way to get men to do their fair share is for men to choose it themselves. Otherwise, most women will pick “fine, I’ll do it all myself” over “I will spend my time and energy on the miserable task of nagging”.\\nAnd why should men self-motivate to do more chores? They don’t have to and most have ready-made excuses for why they force their wives to do it. “It means more to her.” “I work harder and make more money.” “She’s better at it.”\\nSo women say, “Well, it could be worse. So I’m grateful,” because they are trying to cope with a problem that has no real solution. Men aren’t going to get better unless forced. Women don’t have the energy to force.

       " 'hilo 81': 'Quick thread: I strongly support Ellis Act reform. We should compensate tenants much better than we do today when they\\'re displaced to build higher-density housing, and that new housing should be held to minimum standards of affordability -- otherwise why redevelop at all? https://t.co/Rzt5n6elr5\\nThe goal of Ellis Act reform shouldn\\'t be to stop redevelopment, but to discourage it where the difference between existing bldgs and future projects isn\\'t that great. Replace a duplex with 40 units including 6 affordable? Awesome. Replace 20 units with the same? Not so much.\\nOne very important note: This can\\'t be used as an excuse for demonizing developers who build something we desperately need: housing. Even market-rate housing is almost always accompanied by affordable units nowadays, and it costs the city nothing; we need it all.\\nAnd when we reform Ellis to make high-displacement developments less feasible, we need complementary reforms that make low/no-displacement development easier. We need upzones. Single-family neighborhoods near high-quality transit are the obviously-best choice.\\nI also believe we should eliminate the Ellis Act owner/family move-in and conversion to non-residential use provisions, and sharply, *sharply* restrict the ability to convert to condominiums. \"Going out of the rental business\" shouldn\\'t result in a windfall profit to the owner.\\nFurther, Ellis Act payments should be required whether or not a rental unit is occupied. This would discourage underhanded tactics where landlords try to get tenants out of their units *before* filing their Ellis application. Tenants should get what they\\'re due.\\nI still think there\\'s a place for voluntary buy-outs of tenants, so long as they\\'re reported by the property owner -- no off-the-books deals. Some tenants\\' lives will be better off with a $50,000+ buyout than a permanently rent-stabilized apartment. Let them choose.\\nWe can dramatically strengthen tenant protections and increase the supply of homes at all incomes levels -- at the same time. They work better together. Tenant protections to keep things from getting worse, new housing to actually make things better. Both are essential. /end',\n",

You cannot have different dominant cultures in your country, and still preserve and protect the original host culture.\\nHer entire speech was full of facts, logical analysis, and great examples. Never once did she attack any minority groups or spread hatred. She presented herself professionally and academically.\\nStefan began his speech with a very powerful introduction. I had to excuse myself out of the venue during most of his speech, but I returned towards the end.\\n\\nHis perspective this evening was exactly what Adelaide needed to hear. The applause he received shook the venue.\\nDuring Q&amp;A, both Lauren and Stefan were articulate, informative, respectful, professional, and brought new insights from current research. Their presence drew the audience in and held their attention for nearly 3 hours.\\nTonight, I was honoured to open for both of them. More importantly, I am very grateful that they took the time out of their schedules and lives to address their fans in Australia.\\nLastly, left-wing Australian media owes both of them an apology. They portrayed both of them as evil troublemakers, when in reality their entire event was professional, educational and inspirational. The exact opposite of what the media had claimed.',\n",
       " 'hilo 97': '.@andersoncooper, @SavannahGuthrie. Since you both asked, here are some questions for your upcoming interviews with Andy McCabe. \\n\\n1) You told @ScottPelley, \"I was fired because I opened an investigation into the president.\" You secretly opened the investigation in May 2017.\\nRobert Muller took over that investigation about a week after you opened it, also in May 2017. You were fired in March 2018. The first public reporting that you had opened the investigation came via this @nytimes article in January of 2019 - https://t.co/kQhg82viYN\\n- an article for which you seem to have been a primary source. At the time of your firing, nobody outside the FBI and DoJ knew that you had opened the Trump investigation. So, again - why were you fired from the FBI?\\n2) You told @ScottPelley one of your predicates for opening the investigation was Trump\\'s insistence that DAG Rosenstein include \"Russia\" in the firing memo - you said you found that to be an \"articulable fact that indicated that a crime may have been committed.\"\\nYou made it sound as if Trump was asking Rosenstein to fire Comey because of \"Russia\" and to write that in the memo. You know as well as anyone that Trump wanted Rosenstein to note in the memo that Comey had told Trump on three occasions that he wasn\\'t under investigation for...\\n...\"Russia\" - in fact, Trump attached a note to that effect on the memo. Why did you purposely mischaracterize Trump\\'s desire to include \"Russia\" in the firing memo? Given the articulable fact that the reason Trump wanted \"Russia\" mentioned was to tell the country what Comey...\\n...had told him privately, what crime, exactly, did Trump possibly commit in this instance?\\n\\n3) James Comey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2017 that he had never authorized anyone in the FBI to be an anonymous source of information leaked to the...\\n...media related to either the Trump or Clinton investigations. You told the IG that you consulted with Comey about the @WSJ leak that got you fired, and that he was okay with it. Your lawyer said you\\'ve got emails and phone records to prove it. Why did Comey lie under oath to...\\n...the Judiciary committee?\\n\\nThat\\'ll do for a start.',\n",
       " 'hilo 98': \"Bismillah: tonight i would like to add a little thread on a creator. Muslims believe God is a reality. i would like to start with the known scientific fact, that the universe had a beginning. For this i think there are only 4 possibilities:\\n1. Universe came from nothing, \\n2. Universe created itself \\n3. It was created by something else that was created. \\n4. It was created by something that is uncreated.\\nI think these are good possibilities we could discuss.\\n1. What is nothing?, I would define nothing here as general term nothing we know as nothing, where there is no material or matter.  You know and i know that nothing, with infinite time, will still lead to nothing, unless there is something. It will be impossible.\\n2. Can the universe create itself? This is absurd as well, as this means it exist and not exist at the same time. We can't accept this argument as well.\\n3. Can the universe give rise from something already created?, can we have X number of universes?. This is the infinite regress\\nof causes, which means an initial universe could not exist and because an infinite, does not have a beginning, there can never be a beginning. This is also not possible rationally. \\n4. Although it is short, we have arrived at last point, which is the universe began to exist\\nBecause it was caused to come to existence by God, who is eternal, uncreated, and ever -living being. Hence accepting the causality is what science teaches us. This is quite self-evident deductive logic. It does not require an inductive experimental proof, because the God is not\\nwithin his creation, but he is external to its creation. \\nGys who think this does not make sense, please give your comments. @wdddy @MixaanFaqih @Ravans1 @JAkmedd @ZamZamFarish @DhivehiOne @farishussain @fahruveriMulhid\\nOur purpose is to invite you to God and ultimately to islam. we have no intention to force islam down your throat, and we have no obligation to convert you. Perhaps some of you may ponder over these and i feel it may benefit to have this discussion. We see you as misguided.\\nHence, this is the reason we are trying to convince you guys into Islam.\",\n",

Large slaveholders in coastal areas also moved enslaved people around the state to avoid the Union Army &amp; therefore Emancipation.\\nThe confederate states fought a war for the right to own human beings but Texas fought *two* wars for this reason. Conflict over American whites bringing enslaved black people into Mexico, which had abolished slavery in 1829, was a factor in Texas seceding in 1845.\\nThe Texans were hardly alone in their attempts to stall Emancipation. When Northern states began abolishing slavery after the Revolutionary War, slaveholders would wait until shortly before the last day of legal slavery and then sell their Negroes to buyers in slave states.\\nIn other instances slavers simply moved across state lines, taking enslaved people out of a territory where Emancipation was occurring to one where slavery was protected. French slaveholders did the same thing in Haiti during the Revolution, taking slaves to Louisiana.\\nTexas efforts to stall freedom were not unique, they were part of a bigger pattern. There are lots of Juneteenths. Finally it’s worth noting that the order of Emancipation delivered on 6/19/65 also ordered black people to continue to work the same “jobs” they did as slaves.\\nThe order also warned them that “idleness” would not be tolerated, reflecting Northern/Federal concerns about what freedom for black people meant practically.\\nMitch McConnell pointed to the civil war as a kind of reparations for black people.

       " 'https://t.co/K3AoRyBlfi I appreciate the point, that it’s ridiculous that men get kudos for being half as good as women. But I also must point out that brow-beating and nagging is also work, and telling women to do more of it adds to women’s unfair work load.\\nThe reason women do more work is simple: Men force them into a binary choice. You either a) do the work all by yourself or b) nag him. Most of the time, A, while exhausting, is less exhausting than B, which makes you miserable as well as tired.\\nIn addition, men punish women for nagging. They withhold affection, mock women, and in worst case scenarios, abuse them. This is why I call it the “nagging differential” and it is, in my opinion, the main reason domestic labor differences persist.\\nThe problem here is a sticky one: The only way to get men to do their fair share is for men to choose it themselves. Otherwise, most women will pick “fine, I’ll do it all myself” over “I will spend my time and energy on the miserable task of nagging”.\\nAnd why should men self-motivate to do more chores? They don’t have to and most have ready-made excuses for why they force their wives to do it. “It means more to her.” “I work harder and make more money.” “She’s better at it.”\\nSo women say, “Well, it could be worse. So I’m grateful,” because they are trying to cope with a problem that has no real solution. Men aren’t going to get better unless forced. Women don’t have the energy to force. So here we are.\\nReaders will note there is option number 3: Don’t be married. You will note that is increasingly popular. https://t.co/CqN7wYtyeE',\n",

It\\'s like the English language for every rule there are 5 exceptions. My views have evolved over time - from combo of experience &amp; as monitoring tools have improved\\nIf you catch attacker early in attack lifecycle - this one is pretty easy. Take action immediately before they get a strong foothold. Very few exceptions to this rule. Tipoffs you are early in attack lifecycle. Malware owned by primary user of system or malware in startup folder\\nOpposite end of spectrum - if attacker has been there for months/years - it will take at the very (and I mean very) least a few days to get bare minimum handle on infected systems &amp; how accessing the environment. Bigger challenge is client ability to take \"big\" remediation steps\\nMost victims who have to remediate quickly, will do least resilient measures (e.g block IPs/domains, change affected passwords of few accounts, &amp; rebuild a few systems). Biggest risk here is that you\\'ve missed a backdoor &amp; inadequate remediation steps allow attacker to \"run wild\"\\nOnce you\\'ve tipped your hand to attacker - you\\'ve committed your org to permanent whack-a-mole (for as long as it takes) until you\\'ve dealt w/ problem. For great example - check out @ItsReallyNick &amp; @matthewdunwoody\\'s No Easy Breach talk @DerbyCon #APT29 https://t.co/YJmFptpOlC\\nOne time on day 1 of a compromise assessment - I found attacker had compressed a few hundred gigs of sensitive data the day before...but had only stolen a few of the split RAR archives.

We should compensate tenants much better than we do today when they\\'re displaced to build higher-density housing, and that new housing should be held to minimum standards of affordability -- otherwise why redevelop at all? https://t.co/Rzt5n6elr5\\nThe goal of Ellis Act reform shouldn\\'t be to stop redevelopment, but to discourage it where the difference between existing bldgs and future projects isn\\'t that great. Replace a duplex with 40 units including 6 affordable? Awesome. Replace 20 units with the same? Not so much.\\nOne very important note: This can\\'t be used as an excuse for demonizing developers who build something we desperately need: housing. Even market-rate housing is almost always accompanied by affordable units nowadays, and it costs the city nothing; we need it all.\\nAnd when we reform Ellis to make high-displacement developments less feasible, we need complementary reforms that make low/no-displacement development easier. We need upzones. Single-family neighborhoods near high-quality transit are the obviously-best choice.\\nI also believe we should eliminate the Ellis Act owner/family move-in and conversion to non-residential use provisions, and sharply, *sharply* restrict the ability to convert to condominiums. \"Going out of the rental business\" shouldn\\'t result in a windfall profit to the owner.\\nFurther, Ellis Act payments should be required whether or not a rental unit is occupied. This would discourage underhanded tactics where landlords try to get tenants out of their units *before* filing their Ellis application. Tenants should get what they\\'re due.\\nI still think there\\'s a place for voluntary buy-outs of tenants, so long as they\\'re reported by the property owner -- no off-the-books deals. Some tenants\\' lives will be better off with a $50,000+ buyout than a permanently rent-stabilized apartment. Let them choose.\\nWe can dramatically strengthen tenant protections and increase the supply of homes at all incomes levels -- at the same time. They work better together. Tenant protections to keep things from getting worse, new housing to actually make things better. Both are essential. /end',\n",

But impeachment shouldn’t be the only way that a president can be held accountable for committing a crime.\\nNo president should be above the law. So why does this Justice Department act like he is? Because in the 1970s Richard Nixon’s Justice Department wrote a memo saying so (yes, really) and DOJ has continued to stand by that view.\\nCongress should pass a law clarifying that DOJ can indict the president if he or she commits a crime in office, and should amend our obstruction of justice statutes to explicitly allow for indictment when the President abuses the powers of the office—like Donald Trump did.\\nOne of the strongest arguments against indictment is that the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to decide when to interfere with the President's duties. These new laws would eliminate that argument and remove any statutory ambiguity.\\nAttorney General Bill Barr has disgraced himself by acting like Trump’s personal defense attorney. When I’m elected, I will appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one—not even a president—is above the law. And I’ll go one step further:\\nI pledge to nominate an Office of Legal Counsel head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a president cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.

Meghan does not make budgeting decisions. https://t.co/3n5yIkFL5p\\nHer marriage to Harry did not change the amount of money that flowed to the RF. The Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster as well as the royal lands go back centuries. Whether this is a wide arrangement or not is a question for UK citizens to determine\\nbut its existence has nothing to do with Meghan. The state of royal housing, and the requirements for renovations to historical housing also have nothing to do with her. All of that to say that she should have been low on the list of headlines. Despite all their gaslighting the\\nRRs and editors cannot help themselves, so they always fallback on their stock narratives. We already know how this story goes: 1) woman of color is used to sell product, 2) the sales pitch is that said woman of color is undeserving of wealth (or is angry or is uncouth, etc).\\nAny discussion mention of Meghan in these headlines or stories is disingenuous because: (1) she just came on the scene and did not negotiate the agreement between the RF and the government, (2) the sovereign grant is based on a percentage of profits and is not tied to Meghan's\\nentrance to the family, (3) the renovations on Frogmore were going to happen regardless of whether the Sussexes moved in or not, (4) on the scale of royal extravagance this is modest, (5) the expenses represent a tiny percentage of the expenditures on renovations, etc.\\nI could go on but I think I've made my point. There's a mixture of misogynoir, laziness, greed, xenophobia, classism etc. here that results in Meghan being at the center of the action and blamed for problems which existed long before her birth.

These reports are often written to become public, as they bear on some investigation into gov employee misconduct.\\n5) the case in 1974 dealt with some grand jury findings about Nixon officials. The complex rules were followed. the report, after some legal wrangling, was then turned over to a specific House impeachment inquiry.\\n6) None of this bears remotest relation to what Dems are demanding from Barr.

You know as well as anyone that Trump wanted Rosenstein to note in the memo that Comey had told Trump on three occasions that he wasn\\'t under investigation for...\\n...\"Russia\" - in fact, Trump attached a note to that effect on the memo. Why did you purposely mischaracterize Trump\\'s desire to include \"Russia\" in the firing memo? Given the articulable fact that the reason Trump wanted \"Russia\" mentioned was to tell the country what Comey...\\n...had told him privately, what crime, exactly, did Trump possibly commit in this instance?\\n\\n3) James Comey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2017 that he had never authorized anyone in the FBI to be an anonymous source of information leaked to the...\\n...media related to either the Trump or Clinton investigations. You told the IG that you consulted with Comey about the @WSJ leak that got you fired, and that he was okay with it. Your lawyer said you\\'ve got emails and phone records to prove it. Why did Comey lie under oath to...\\n...the Judiciary committee?\\n\\nThat\\'ll do for a start.',\n",
       " \"Bismillah: tonight i would like to add a little thread on a creator. Muslims believe God is a reality. i would like to start with the known scientific fact, that the universe had a beginning. For this i think there are only 4 possibilities:\\n1. Universe came from nothing, \\n2. Universe created itself \\n3. It was created by something else that was created. \\n4. It was created by something that is uncreated.\\nI think these are good possibilities we could discuss.\\n1. What is nothing?, I would define nothing here as general term nothing we know as nothing, where there is no material or matter.  You know and i know that nothing, with infinite time, will still lead to nothing, unless there is something. It will be impossible.\\n2. Can the universe create itself? This is absurd as well, as this means it exist and not exist at the same time. We can't accept this argument as well.\\n3. Can the universe give rise from something already created?, can we have X number of universes?. This is the infinite regress\\nof causes, which means an initial universe could not exist and because an infinite, does not have a beginning, there can never be a beginning. This is also not possible rationally. \\n4. Although it is short, we have arrived at last point, which is the universe began to exist\\nBecause it was caused to come to existence by God, who is eternal, uncreated, and ever -living being. Hence accepting the causality is what science teaches us. This is quite self-evident deductive logic. It does not require an inductive experimental proof, because the God is not\\nwithin his creation, but he is external to its creation. \\nGys who think this does not make sense, please give your comments. @wdddy @MixaanFaqih @Ravans1 @JAkmedd @ZamZamFarish @DhivehiOne @farishussain @fahruveriMulhid\\nOur purpose is to invite you to God and ultimately to islam. we have no intention to force islam down your throat, and we have no obligation to convert you.

It was a packed room, and yet no one seemed to see.\\nI say 9 or 10 years old because the truth is I can't remember if it we were ringing in 1990 or 1991. I don't remember if there were 50 people in the room or 100, just that there were a lot. I don't remember his name or really what he looked like. But I do remember his open mouth.\\nI remember the dress I was wearing so clearly in my mind, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn if I was wearing something else entirely. I don't remember where my parents were. I don't remember the music, or what happened earlier in the evening. But I do remember his open mouth.\\nI didn't tell my parents about it, not for years and years. The memory was sickening, but I didn't think it counted as 'real' assault. Just a kiss right? And he was a family friend! I didn't want to cause drama. But I always remembered his open mouth.\\nIf I were, for whatever reason, called on to give evidence about that moment and that night I'm sure even a sub par legal team would be able to rip holes in my testimony. To present me as an unreliable witness, with dates that didn't line up and inconsistent timelines.\\nIt would be easy to do. Because I don't remember everything about just one of the 'inappropriate' things that was done to me as a kid, and I can't recall the exact details of something that happened 28 or 29 years ago. But I do remember his open mouth. I could never forget that.\\nI consider myself lucky in comparison to others. But it boggles the mind to know that 'inconsistency of timelines' is one of the many arguments apologists use to discredit survivors like those of Pell. I don't doubt for a second that man remembered the details that counted.\\nAnd to be clear, I don't categorise what happened to me as even remotely in the same field as what Pell did to his victims. All I'm saying is I know that the kernel of a memory can't be discredited by the wispy details that surround it.\\nAnd a room or environment being 'busy' has never, ever stopped opportunistic predators from abusing people with less power than them.\",\n",

       " \"Is cultural appropriation always racist? No.\\nCan we culturally appropriate? Yes. \\nHow do we culturally appropriate? With respect and ethics.\\nSee? That wasn't so hard.\\n\\nFor example: In my novel, THE SYMPATHIZER, I culturally appropriated Ralph Ellison, T.S. Eliot, and Homer\\nIN THE FIRST CHAPTER. I went on to culturally appropriate Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, John Le Carré, Philip Roth, Francis Ford Coppola, and more. \\n\\nI felt I could do so BECAUSE I HAD STUDIED THE WESTERN TRADITION and read and reread the sources I wanted to allude to or\\nappropriate. That's the thing--so-called minorities like myself have to know THE SO-CALLED MAJOR TRADITION, the CANON, and we have to know our own tradition. This is the way cultural appropriation should work. When someone doesn't know a tradition and steals from it or shows it\\ndisrespect--that's negative cultural appropriation. \\n\\nThat doesn't mean there can't be criticism of the tradition you appropriate. See the section in THE SYMPATHIZER on Hollywood filmmaking. I satirized the shit out of Hollywood because I've been watching its good and bad stuff\\nmy entire life. How many people of the majority can claim they've spent their entire lives studying another tradition? \\n\\nA few. I can respect those people as long as they don't claim that they're speaking for another tradition, one that they don't have to live in.\\nLastly, appropriation is not just majority to minority or vice versa. It works across so-called minorities in the same way. I wrote a short story from an African American bomber pilot's perspective in THE REFUGEES. I felt I could do so because I spent a great deal of time\\nreading African American literature and studies, as well as the memoirs of American soldiers and pilots. \\n\\nAppropriation may or may not be right word for every act of borrowing, allusion, or identification. Because I made money off these writing acts, however, appropriation\\nmay be the right word. I took great care in doing so, including studying the ideas and perspectives of my sources. I READ EVERY SINGLE BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA BEFORE I SATIRIZED APOCALYPSE NOW.\\nHow many American directors who have made movies about the war in Viet Nam can say they have read a dozen books from Vietnamese perspectives?\",\n",

Going forward, Pelosi statements will appear more correct w/ each passing day\\n2 When a Dementia patient tells ppl how smart they are, it’s typical mid-stage ranting. When they say they are fine, but someone else is mentally ill, like Trump did w/ Pelosi, the patient is entering their final public days. Pelosi opened the floodgates for others to speak out.\\n3 Trump revealed his dementia denial process on the WH lawn, when he said a/b Pelosi, “Did you hear what she said about me?\", “She said terrible things”, “You think Nancy’s the same as she was? She’s not. Maybe we can all say that.” The last sentence is the tell. He\\'s in denial.\\n4 “Maybe we can all say that” is Trump’s twisted denial that his dementia is just normal aging. It’s not. He\\'s rapidly deteriorating. Btw- Pelosi’s brain is working just fine &amp; Trump hates that. She’s smarter, faster &amp; schooling him on a regular basis. The mismatch crushes him\\n5 Pelosi has destroyed Trump’s health cover up charade. “Intervention\", \"pray\", \"well being,” are all keys words that shout \"Dementia.\" She sincerely feels &amp; knows he should resign &amp; get help. It may be a reason she’s held back the impeachment guns. Ppl in govt know Trump is gone\\n6 Fighting it never works. Barr will break the law, but he hasn’t discovered a cure for dementia, which means Trump is SOL. Posting fake videos of Pelosi only makes Trump look sicker. It doesn\\'t slow what\\'s happening to him- relentless deterioration from Frontotemporal dementia.\\n7 When the dementia patient has “the car keys taken away” (metaphor for losing authority), a wide range of reactions occur. I’ve personally witnessed patients be:\\n1 Cooperative &amp; accepting\\n2 Angry &amp; screaming\\n3 Highly violent\\n\\nMy guess is Trump will be angry &amp; screaming non stop.\\n8 Fortunately the Secret Service will be able to keep Trump under control.

Rios Montt was de facto ruler of Guatemala... More than 200,000 Guatemalans perished during the civil war.\"\\n5/ Instrumental in paving the way for US funding to Rios Montt was none other than, you guessed it, Elliott Abrams! He played a key role in whitewashing the utterly brutal tactics that Rios Montt used during the war\\n6/ Per the NYT, Abrams in 1983 justified US backing of Rios Montt on the grounds that he had \"brought considerable progress\" to Guatemala when it came to human rights. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/AJIDf74h4Z\\n7/ Abrams also tsk-tsked concerns about Rios Montt\\'s slaughter of civilians by saying, \"the amount of killing of innocent civilians is being reduced step by step,\" while further adding that \"we think that kind of progress needs to be rewarded and encouraged.\"\\n8/ And this, frankly, is why everyone who has a basic understanding of history should not believe for a single second that the Trump administration appointed Abrams to bring freedom and democracy to Venezuela.

This may mean a new backdoor family or they may move to web shells, tunnelers, using legit creds for VPN/Citrix/cloud services, etc. They may leave their burned tooling or remove it.\\nThe attacker may also go for spray and pray - deploying so much malware that the victim can't keep up, thus buying time to complete the mission. This may require more labor, but doesn't require much depth of tooling. This is a good tactic for smash and grab operations.\\nThe attacker may do both, as in the incident we discussed in #noeasybreach - deploying new and stealthy malware while also mass-deploying known backdoors.\\nOf course, the attacker may pack up and leave, if they have already completed their mission, or if they are very sensitive to being identified or averse to exposing TTPs.

Basically, what Iran is doing in Syria is broadening up its military infrastructure.\\n8-Uzi Rabi: “I think that Israel, having realised that Iran is fastly approaching the red line, is trying to publicise what should be published in order to give Iran kind of a warning sign.\"\\n9-Israeli military: We began obtaining information regarding foreign experts helping Syria develop the Deir el-Zour site in late 2004. Later , we discovered that North Korea was helping Syria build a reactor to manufacture plutonium.\\n10-Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 until 2009 and was recently released from prison after serving time for corruption, is expected to delve more deeply into the issue in his upcoming book, which may have spurred the military into coming clean about the mission.',\n",

       " '(Thread) Last week @MichaelAvenatti filed a new motion in the Stormy-Cohen-Trump defamation case. Here’s the document:\\nhttps://t.co/LcZLH8CYFQ …\\nHe\\'s trying to depose Trump. Here\\'s an explainer.\\nFirst, the background:\\n#StormyDaniels\\n1/ Oct. 2016: #MichaelCohen worked with Stormy’s lawyer #KeithDavidson to arrange for Stormy to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) \\n[What’s that? See this thread: https://t.co/uPZPG4ztTu ]\\n\\nJan 2018: someone leaked the agreement to the WSJ. Stormy said it wasn\\'t her.\\n2/ Cohen, using “intimidation and coercive tactics, forced [Stormy] to sign a false statement” denying she had an affair with Trump. [Quotations are from her complaint, here: https://t.co/9DgWR7giPN ]\\n\\nCohen then issued a public statement about the hush agreement, prompting. . .\\n3/ . . Trump supporters to unleash a torrent of “ridicule and threats” against Stormy—but she couldn’t defend herself because of the NDA.\\nSo Stormy hired Avenatti and sued to be released from her NDA.\\nCohen (stupidly) moved the case to federal court.\\n4/This gave giving the chance to amend her complaint, so she did: She sued Cohen for defamation. Trump then called Stormy a liar. So she sued Trump for defamation as well. \\nLast month, Cohen won a victory: he told the court he\\'d be pleading the 5th in his criminal SDNY case . . .\\n5/. . .and because of the overlap between the cases, Stormy\\'s case had to be put on hold, or he\\'d be forced to incriminate himself in Stormy\\'s case in violation of his 5th Amend. rights. He got a 3 month stay.\\nBut Trump and his \"lawyer\" Giuliani continued making press statements.\\n6/They made statements like \"the 130K payment was perfectly legal\" and statements about how Trump reimbursed Cohen. (Oops. Trump wasn\\'t supposed to know about any of it.)\\nSo Avenatti\\'s new motion argues that because Trump (obviously) knows everything, as per these statements...\\n7/ Avenatti can depose Trump instead of Cohen, and no need to keep the case on hold. \\n[Twitter Law 101: A deposition is when a party or witness to a lawsuit answers questions under oath as part of the pre-trial evidence-gathering process.]\\nIf the judge grants Avenatti\\'s motion,\\n8/. . . Avenatti would get to depose Trump. \\nPause for a moment to imagine Avenatti deposing Trump ! ! ! \\nNow we wait to see how the judge rules on Avenatti\\'s motion.\\n\\nAvenatti\\'s motion shows the problem with Trump\\'s \"flood the zone\" strategy: It\\'s backfiring in the Stormy case.\\n9/ What do I mean by the \"flood the zone\" strategy?

       " 'Illegal is an incorrect and hateful term. And it\\'s especially inaccurate in this context. \\n\\nAllow me to explain. https://t.co/F1cZQmVda3\\nSince people like to bring up following the law, they should probably know what it is, and what it isn\\'t. The federal misdemeanor, § 1325, is improper entry. It\\'s a misdemeanor, not a felony. The law is written as improper (not illegal) entry.\\nIf you\\'re convicted under § 1325 and return without authorization you may then be charged under federal felony, § 1326, for re-entry. That\\'s it. Those are the only two immigration crimes in the United States of America.\\nAs far as I know, no child has ever been tried under § 1325 (or therefore under § 1326). So to write, as so many reporters surprisingly do, that a child entered \"illegally\" is ignorant.\\nBut what about adults who stand accused of breaking the law? Well, when reporters write about people who\\'re charged, we always use words like alleged or suspected. Even when there\\'s video and other clear evidence, it\\'s always alleged until the person in question is found guilty*.\\n*except with it comes to brown people crossing the border. There\\'s an unstated exception, to the point where it\\'s now standard, to use a presumed crime to write that someone is \"illegal,\" it that they crossed \"illegally.\" It\\'s plainly wrong and it\\'s unethical.\\nIt\\'s especially troubling because a lot of the people that you read about who are described as having \"crossed illegally\" haven\\'t even been charged. There isn\\'t even a legal allegation of a crime yet the writing already suggests a conviction.\\nWhen it comes to ICE operations (the pending ones aren\\'t exactly raids, but I\\'ll save that for another day), we\\'re talking about people who have never even been charged with a crime. That\\'s because most immigration law in the United States of civil. Not criminal.\\nThe family members that are reportedly being targeted for removal? My guess is somewhere between 99-100% have never been charged with the federal misdemeanor of improper entry. That\\'s why ICE technically \"detains\" instead of \"arrests.\" Because we\\'re talking about a civil issue.\\nIn fact, some of those family members entered *with* authorization. But the civil law that applied to them may have altered their authorization. Like most things, it\\'s complicated. And using the term \"illegal\" to apply to an entire class of people is not a good thing. Do better.',\n",

Acosta instead let Epstein plead on *prostitution* charges in state court.\\n(State prostitution charges, really? If you\\'re a grown-ass man doing this to children, is it really the most important thing under the law to know whether or not you also gave the kids money?? Arrrrgh.) Forgive the aside.\\nThe basis for the civil case that led to today\\'s ruling was the Crime Victims\\' Rights Act, which should have *blocked* Acosta from doing this deal in secret with Epstein, without telling his potential victims. \\n\\nHere, Julie Brown sums it up elegantly: https://t.co/sNCoACvYIk\\nToday, as Brown sums it up, the judge ruled that, \"while prosecutors had the right to resolve the case in any way they saw fit, they violated the law by hiding the agreement from Epstein’s victims.\"\\nAnd which prosecutors did that specifically? Was it someone just working below Alex Acosta that he might not have known about? Someone he just didn\\'t adequately supervise on this case? \\n\\nUh, not according to the judge. Read this: https://t.co/OBxcztevut\\nSo, a federal judge just ruled that the current Labor Secretary gave a secret non-prosecution agreement to a prolific, serial child sex offender -- then broke the law by agreeing with the guy\\'s defense team that they\\'d all keep it secret from the victims.\\nDid I mention that Alex Acosta is now a Trump cabinet official?

Keynote Speaker was Dr. Angela Y. Davis. Illinois Lt. Gov. Julianna Stratton gave remarks. Chance the Rapper performed. https://t.co/dPFIvkQ4Th\\nDarrell Fair, one of the incarcerated graduates, was also tapped to speak. In his speech, Fair connected Reagan\\'s \\'86 War on Drungs to Clinton\\'s \\'94 Crime bill -- something that Dr. David would touch on later. https://t.co/5JadIiNcKW\\nFair said that these two acts not only fueled mass-incarceration but increasingly discarded education from prisons.\\nDevon Terrell, another graduate, delivered a poem entitled \"For Youth\\'s Sake\". In the poem, Terrell challenges complacency and insists people should take initiative in creating positive social change and being their best self \"for youth\\'s sake\". He dedicated the poem to his son. https://t.co/p2wpnFIKu9\\nLt. Gov. Julianna Stratton gave warm regards to the graduating class. She emphasized her belief in restorative and transformative justice. Stratton told the graduates that their lived experiences matter and that said experiences are needed to inform politicians as well as others.\\nDr. Angela Y. Davis lectured about how critical the political prisoner is to movements and knowledge producing. Dr. Davis gave examples of incarcerated activists expanding feminist and abolitionist frameworks. She didn\\'t shy away from questioning the necessity of prisons too.\\nChance The Rapper performed to bleachers filled with men in their state blues. He performed the uplifting songs \"Blessings\" and the audience was with him every step of the way. Chance was visibly emotional as incarcerated men were standing singing along and not missing a beat.\\nImagine the organizing labor it took to get Julianna Stratton, Dr. Angela Y. Davis, and Chance The Rapper in the same room with an inaugural graduating class within a maximum security prison.

       " '(THREAD) Peter’s experience has spurred me to share mine. \\n\\n2 weeks ago, as I was crossing back into Israel from Jordan, I was separated from my family and detained by Shin Bet. “We can make it so you don’t see your kids for a long time” I was warned. \\n\\nThis is what happened next https://t.co/syxVj23BNx\\nThe Shin Bet lady, who already knew everything about me and my family’s journey around the world, began with “You think because you’re a public person I can’t do whatever I want with you?” \\n\\nI was floored. This is how interrogations begin in police states.\\n“Why do you hate Israel?” She asked.\\n\\n“I don’t hate Israel,” I replied.\\n\\n“But you hate our Prime Minister.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry is your Prime Minister Israel?”\\n\\n“He was democratically elected!” (No he wasn’t but let’s just drop that)\\n\\n“So was Trump and I hate him and still love America.”\\n“Oh I know all about you and Trump,” she spat. \\n\\nI forgot the Israeli Right Wing’s affection for our racist Neo-Nazi loving president. \\n\\n“You don’t think Israel should exist yes?”\\n\\nThat’s absurd. I’m against the occupation not Israel. \\n\\nThen the police state part began in earnest\\nWrite down names of Palestinians you know\\n\\nWrite down names of journalists you associate with\\n\\nWrite down names of Palestinian organizations you support\\n\\nAnd constantly, repeatedly, this threat: “if you don’t cooperate it will be a long time before you see your kids again.”\\nI tried to cooperate the best I could. It was 104 degrees. My wife, my two 6yr olds, my 3yr old, and I my two elderly in-laws had been waiting for me in the sun for hours. \\n\\nBut (again the police state tactic): every answer I gave she told me was lie. \\n\\n“Stop lying!” She’d yell.\\nThe questions got dumber and more surreal:\\n\\n“Who did your father work for in Iran?”\\n\\nI don’t know. I was 7 when we left\\n\\n“Oh Mr Scholar! You can tell me everything about the Ottoman Empire but you don’t know your own father’s history?”\\n\\nFor the record I am not an Ottoman scholar.\\nIn the end, after hours of this, she warned “I may let you into Israel but, who knows, I may not let you out. I will keep you here and kick out your family. It depends on you. You would miss your kids yes?”\\n\\nThat my friends is the classic police state trick. Iran has perfected it\\nHer final warning was not to visit the Palestinian Territories. Not to meet with or speak to any Palestinians or any Israeli trouble makers. \\n\\n“We are watching you.”\\n\\n2 days later I went to Bethlehem, to the wall, and took this picture: https://t.co/9RZyUjPVmo\\nTwo days after that, the Italian artist who painted this portrait of Ahed Tamimi was arrested and deported.\\n\\nThis was my 4th trip to Israel in ten years and every time it’s gotten worse. It’s becoming unrecognizable as a democracy. It is becoming a full-blown police state.\\nAnd it can’t last. \\n\\nWhen I was released my evangelical in-laws were in shock.\\n\\n“I had no idea it was like this,” they said. Now they do. So do more Americans each day. And if Israel loses them, who will continue to shield it from pressure to change course? \\n\\nThe clock is ticking',\n",

I did some digging in the FEC. Turns out Saikat has \"hired\" her boyfriend, before...just not to do any actual work.\\n.@AOC paid Brand New Congress LLC, which @saikatc owns, for strategic consulting. @BrandNew535, the PAC Saikat ran in parallel to his LLC, turned around and paid Riley Roberts - the boyfriend - the same amount as its sole \"marketing consultant\". How swampy.\\nThe payments to Roberts are the largest payments made by @BrandNew535 to any person or group other than Brand New Congress LLC. Oh, and Roberts doesn\\'t work in marketing. https://t.co/XN8AYl0l7J\\nPlus, the timing looks bad. \\n\\n.@BrandNew535 paid Riley Roberts $3,000 on August 9th, 2017.\\n\\n@AOC\\'s campaign paid Brand New Congress LLC $6,191.32 on August 27th.\\n\\nA month later @BrandNew535 then paid Riley Roberts another $3,000. https://t.co/Oym09gLGZy\\nRoberts lists his residence as Arizona, where he\\'s from, for the purposes of the disbursement, but for the in-kind work in 2018 and his cash donations to @AOC\\'s campaign, he lists New York. Looks like a sad attempt to be sneaky. https://t.co/lNAzmm4svP\\nWhen @BrandNew535 decided to pay six grand to Roberts, AOC\\'s campaign was $24,000 in the hole, having raised only about $3,000. By the end of 2017, she\\'d raised just over $8,000 but spent about $37,250. That\\'s a lot of money on somebody\\'s credit card. https://t.co/0vdioqSigu\\nNow @saikatc says he left @BrandNew535 sometime in August of 2017. But @justicedems, which he continued running, and which remains on his profile, shared an address with @AOC\\'s campaign. It appears he still owns Brand New Congress LLC. https://t.co/T0MS7ab80x\\n.@saikatc funneling money to Roberts - who @AOC says is her spouse - is unethical and maybe illegal.

       " '1/ There\\'s an excellent parallel between the idea of a personal \"Second Brain,\" and event-sourcing in relational databases\\n2/ Relational databases traditionally had to be \"architected\" upfront, forcing you to think very hard about the data and which is the \"correct\" model, how the data should be connected, without real-world testing\\n3/ But now with event sourcing, you don\\'t store the global model, which is huge and vulnerable to changes. You store only changes (called events or experiences) to the model\\n4/ By storing only the changes, you can construct a model that fits real data if you want, but if it no longer works down the line, just throw it away and use the changes to build a new model that fits the data better\\n5/ This allows you to embrace and even be hungry for more data, more events, more change, because changes don\\'t threaten the global model. Your system is anti-fragile, it can handle rapid change\\n6/ For similar reasons, your digital second brain should only store the *excerpts* from sources that you consume, not entire source texts. Save only the parts that inspire or surprise you, because those feelings are signs of a \"change\" in your model\\n7/ Trad\\'l knowledge management was like trad\\'l relational databases, trying to build a comprehensive model of a person\\'s or organization\\'s knowledge base in a hierarchical, rigid format\\n8/ This never worked, not just because knowledge doesn\\'t fit into a comprehensive taxonomy, but because as you approached completeness, your model got more rigid and resistant to change, slowing down your learning, making your knowledge obsolete\\n9/ So knowledge mgmt was inherently self-destructive. But PERSONAL knowledge mgmt puts control of each person\\'s knowledge base in their own hands, and trains them to manage it informally using something like digital notes\\n10/ The informality is key: because you\\'re free to store only fragments, snippets, and pieces of sources residing elsewhere, you have a record of changes that, like in event sourcing, you\\'re free to fit into new models whenever needed\\n11/ This makes change no longer threatening – it is more events to fit into more models. Info overload becomes a thing of the past, because your sphere of responsibility is actually quite small: only unexpected changes',\n",

He called my Mom and told her he was flying to Miami after his shift.\\nHe jumped on a plane and got to the stadium just in time for the game. As he was heading in, there was a young kid outside the gate going up to people and saying \"anyone have a ticket?\" My father went up to him and said \"come with me\" and they went in together.\\nThey had just enough time to call the kid\\'s parent and let them know he was going to the game, and with whom (yes, this was 1968). They didn\\'t realize how good the tix were until they got to their seats - they were close to the field and near the 50 yard line.\\nAlthough my father is terrible at recognizing celebrities, he knew that Jackie Gleason was sitting behind him. The game was legendary, Joe Namath the underdog made good on his guarantee of a win, and my Dad ended up with a great story that he has told his entire life.\\nAnd every time he tells the story, we wonder about the kid he took with him and how it must have been for him. And then this year, on the 50th anniversary, it occurred to me and my sibs that we might actually have a chance of finding the \"kid\", who, by my Dad\\'s\\nestimate, is probably about 60 years old now. So here\\'s my question for you: Do you know someone who tells a story about going to Super Bowl III in Miami when they were about 10 years old with a random guy from Boston who worked for the airlines?\\nIf that story sounds at all familiar, please message me, and if not, please RT far and wide. My Dad is 82 and it would be so cool if we could connect him with the \"kid.\"\\nWow Twitter, you get a lot done while I\\'m sleeping! This seems like it might actually work, so here\\'s a photo of my dad from around 1969. https://t.co/Jz2VYVYI3K\\nQuick update to all of you who have become invested in this story. We have not found him, but the response has been amazing, and we got some great ideas for next steps. We\\'ll be combing footage of the game and the NFL has offered to help us find photos of fans in the crowd.\\nThey were sitting in a section with celebrities (so far Jackie Gleason is the only confirmed celebrity, but there are likely more), so this should be a lot easier than if they were sitting in the nosebleeds.\\nStill no promising leads on finding the \"kid\", but we\\'re still trying.

The miracle that the EU created was to allow frictionless trade, which was once possible only WITHIN the borders of a single national entity, into something possible BETWEEN nations.\\n\\n7\\nThe instruments to achieve this are both the CU and the SM. \\nOnly by combining the abolition of tariffs (CU) with agreed regulation of product standards (SM), frictionless trade can be achieved even between bordering nations.\\nFoM simply follows from that.\\n8\\nThis is why there is still a problem in the Brexit camp at understanding the economic red lines.\\nThe EU cannot accept a third country to enjoy frictionless trade while outside the CU and SM.\\nBut are perfectly happy to have an FTA that drops all tariffs.\\n\\n9\\nWhat HMG has recently realized, is that what would cause immense damage to the economy, is nothing to do with trade per se, but such trade ceasing to be frictionless.\\nThe public instead is still uninformed of the fact that no FTA can ever achieve frictionless trade. \\n10\\nTherefore when talking to Leavers  please explain:\\n\\nTHERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TARIFF FREE AND FRICTIONLESS TRADE.\\nTARIFF FREE WE CAN ACHIEVE OUTSIDE THE EU, BUT A LARGE PART OF UK BUSINESS DEPENDS OF FRICTIONLESS TRADE, WHICH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED OUTSIDE OF THE EU.\\n\\n11',\n",
       " \"Thread. Yesterday the account “Rachel” Swindon much loved by @jeremycorbyn’s office, tweeted a fake video of soldiers beating up a child. She said it was Israel - it wasn’t, it took place in Guatemala. \\n\\nAs you can see, she’s trying to excuse herself. https://t.co/PPgIStLzIM 1/11 https://t.co/EXUVwOhJPa\\nWhy was this antisemitism, some of you may ask?\\n\\nFirstly as the IHRA definition of antisemitism states:\\n\\n“Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.”2/11\\nThe second reason is historical, and it's exceptionally repulsive. \\n\\nThere is an old antisemitic trope which took place at Easter called the “blood libel”. In 1144 a child, William of Norwich was murdered at Easter, without evidence the Christian community blamed the Jews. 3/11\\nThis rumour spread like wildfire across Europe and it mutated into many other theories about Jews having to “murder children” to fulfill prophecies of returning to Israel, note the link to Israel.. it’s always there with antisemites - it means the “collective Jew” to them 4/11\\nMillions of Jews were killed throughout the ages based on this one falsehood. The last known person put on trial for this horrific untrue antisemitic trope was Menahem Mendel Beilis. His grandson is on twitter bravely fighting antisemitism just like his g/father @beilis_jay 5/11\\nSo when Rachel Swindon tweets fake videos, at Easter, of Israel as the “collective Jew”. We know what she’s doing, and when @grahamemorris a @UKLabour MP RTs it - he knows what he is doing. 6/11\\nFinally Rachel Swindon is a prolific antisemite and “Jew Baiter” who consistently denies #LabourAntisemitism 7/11\\nHere is an example of Rachel Swindon's handiwork. Taunting @JewishLabour with the age old antisemitic trope that “Jews love money” 8/11 https://t.co/d5Bsx9eqsp\\nHere she is again using Rothchilds tropes to mean Jews. Incidentally these are ALWAYS antisemitic, these tropes were promoted by the Nazis, who even made antisemitic propaganda films from them, for the masses. 9/11 https://t.co/sBqZXrB3nJ\\nRachel Swindon’s account has been sanctioned by twitter on many occasions for abusive behaviour, each time she is reinstated. Why? 10/11 https://t.co/V4U4SLKL7x\\nSo when you see decent @UKLabour voters supporting her or RTing her, remind them, that she’s the worst kind of antisemite, one who does it for attention and pay pal donations. 11/11 https://t.co/PPgIStLzIM\",\n",
       " '1. The position that CNN was wrong to end Marc Lamont Hill’s contributorship over his anti-Semitism is perfectly legitimate and defensible—and is the position I tend to take on such controversies, very much including anti-Israel figures. But I disagree this time. I’ll explain why\\n2. There are two reasons. The first is the nature of the job. If MLH were, idk, an exec at a construction company or something, firing him over his views would be insane and cruel. But that’s not the case here—and indeed he’s not in danger of losing his day job.\\n3. CNN gig is the network bringing him on occasionally to opine on current affairs. His views on current affairs are riddled w/overt bigotry. I also thought Fox was right to banish its guest who made anti-Semitic comments about Soros. No reason to bring the guy back on air. None.\\n4. My views on Fox not bringing back on bigoted pundits are unremarkable. When the same principle is applied to CNN, it’s considered censorious—even though MLH has a far more prestigious and influential place in politics and culture than the Fox guy you don’t even remember.\\n5. And that, one suspects, is one reason for the hypocrisy: leftists think pawns can be taken off the board at will but please leave the bishop alone. That anti-Semites are considered so valuable to liberalism (the Forward defense of Sarsour et al) is a chilling admission.\\n6. The second reason is the nature of the comments. He did not call some Jewish guy greedy or scheming or whatever. No dog whistles. He used the single most famous genocidal anti-Israel call to arms in existence. To a room full of states who take such action!\\n7. And in the same speech, he told a room full of representatives of terror-supporting anti-Semitic states to *ignore calls for nonviolence regarding the Jewish state.* I think it’s kind of getting lost just how completely psychotic his speech actually was.\\n8. When he concluded with the famous genocidal slogan, the entire hall was electric with enthusiastic applause. It was like watching a between-the-wars Bavarian beer hall times a hundred.\\n9. But there’s a key difference: it wasn’t just a hall of angry people. It was a hall of representatives of countries around the world, at the headquarters of the world body, with that body’s imprimatur. \\n\\nHave you completely lost your goddamned minds?\\n10. Now again, you can defend his pundit job without defending his remarks. But the campaign to portray this as just a political disagreement is disingenuous in the extreme. If your position is there are no lines, fine. But if a line exists, MLH is on the wrong side of it. /fin\\nAnyhoo that’s where I’m coming from. I cannot imagine defending MLH’s conduct—because it’s indefensible. But I absolutely *can* understand defending his paid CNN role to occasionally come on air and vomit nonsense. It is tv, after all. Thanks for listening.',\n",
       " '1. The constituent members of Mueller\\'s special counsel are now the object of intense focus, and rightfully so: a plurality of them have contributed to Dem elections including that of Hillary and Obama. This is curious, bizarre and incongruent with logic. https://t.co/jcQ4WtUUmo\\n2. Muellers selection of this motley crew of Hillary elves toiling and texting away can be explained on a few levels of logic (presuming, I have logic). The first possibility is that this is pure chance, coincidence, happenstance.\\n3. However the probabilistic likelihood of having so many democratic leaning constituents all in an investigation designed to uncover Trumps collusion purely by chance is mathematically infinitesimal.\\n4. The other possibility is that Mueller is vehemently anti-Trump and wanted to make sure that nothing came between him and implicating Trump, not even actual facts, justice or doing the right thing. \"Guilty before the investigation\" dynamic.\\n5.  Mueller is many things, stupid he is not. He knows exactly who is doing what and he knew exactly what each of them have done. The mathematical probability that they all landed in the same place for a specific reason is fairly high, but was it to implicate Trump?\\n6.

       " '1. I\\'m gonna write a proper piece about this soon, but for now a quick thread on the direction of US conservative climate policy. I think over the next 10 years -- &amp; probably much sooner -- we\\'ll see two distinct trends.\\n2. First, the US right will transition seamlessly from climate denialism to climate nationalism/fascism. They will acknowledge the threat &amp; use it to justify exploiting US fossil fuel reserves, building walls, shutting down immigration, &amp; passing punitive trade policies.\\n3. Collective action problems just don\\'t sit well in the reactionary mind -- and non-zero-sum collective solutions are incomprehensible to it. However, a mad scramble of all-against-all, in which the powerful US can hoard &amp; intimidate &amp; come out ahead? That, reactionaries get.\\n4. Second, US conservatives will ramp up their demagoguery around \"eco-terrorism.\" As it becomes clear that the GOP simply won\\'t allow a small-d democratic solution, desperate young people are going to turn to direct action. The GOP will use that to justify repression.\\n5. And be clear: as climate gets more &amp; more chaotic, and the ambient sense of threat &amp; uncertainty rises around the world, these kinds of reactionary responses will gain *more* public appeal, not less. Threat &amp; uncertainty make everyone more conservative.\\n6. So the US is at a crucial juncture, one that reflects a larger global dynamic: the space for addressing climate change in a cooperative, mutually beneficial way is rapidly shrinking. From here on out, circumstances will bolster the forces of reaction.\\n7. That\\'s why the situation in Oregon is freaking me out. I thought we had at least a little time left in which the mechanisms of democracy could still work. But the fossil-funded white minority is openly, nakedly rejecting democracy &amp; it looks like they\\'ll get away with it.\\n8. The right will see that it worked &amp; it will rapidly become standard practice, across states, maybe federally. (If you think the rules are different in different states, so it wouldn\\'t work, you are still hung up on thinking rules matter.)\\n9. That would mean the end of any chance of the US addressing climate change through peaceful, mutually beneficial, democratic means. Oregon Ds elected majorities, then super-majorities ... now they\\'re supposed to accept that success is only possible if they vote EVERY R out?\\n10. If democratic means become impossible, what\\'s left is violence. There may be some radical climate activists who think they\\'re ready for that, but guess what? The reactionaries will always have more guns &amp; fewer scruples. The forces of decency will never win that fight.\\n11. Basically, this is future-of-the-species stuff, getting decided through a spectacle that\\'s barely even able to break into the daily news cycle. And the next time around, there may not even be the pretense of democracy. We are truly headed into the shit. &lt;/fin&gt;',\n",

I feel that they’ve captured that quality of their dynamic at this early part of their relationship quite well.\\nThey’ve never lived together.

Roger hasn’t yet learned that Brianna pushes away when she really wants people to stay in an argument (to his credit he DOES learn this).\\nFurthermore, Bree is a terrible communicator who hasn’t yet learned that Roger will always follow through on his word and commitments. (She grew up an only child remember, with two parents who actively didn’t communicate about certain things as role models.)\\nNavigating these minefields of communication is part of why the novels are so great: You can read each characters inner monologue and understand their point of view even if it makes you all “GAAAHH!!!” https://t.co/q3cEKWOOn4\\nThe ongoing difficulty of adapting these novels for tv is that inner monologues—by necessity of medium—have to become dialogue, Outer Monologue, or visible.

       " 'Sarah Huckabee Sanders is upset about \"silence from the left\" re Sam Bee calling Ivanka a \"feckless cunt\" for swanning around on social media, hugging her son amidst news of children being ripped from their parents by ICE. So I won\\'t be silent:\\nhttps://t.co/FA79R4sWgT\\n1. Language\\'s ability to inflict harm depends on power of who\\'s wielding it &amp; against whom it\\'s being wielded. Not just individuals, ie, it\\'s not about Bee/Ivanka or Roseanne/Jarrett, all of whom have power. It\\'s about power of entities &amp; ideas individuals are representing.\\n2. So when Bee goes after Ivanka for supporting an administration that\\'s doing grievous harm to the bodies, families, lives of human beings, she\\'s acting on behalf of less powerful people (immigrants ripped from their children) against the grotesquely powerful &amp; abusive.\\n3. You can not like the word \"cunt\" for feminist reasons; you can--&amp; should!--think about why a term for female anatomy is such a potent pejorative. But use of it in this context is not reinforcing or replicating the crude harm it has been used to inflict historically...\\n4. ie the patriarchal diminishment &amp; vilification of women. In fact, Bee is using it to critique a woman precisely because that woman is acting ON BEHALF OF THAT PATRIARCHY, one which systematically diminishes women, destroys families, hurts kids, especially non-white.\\n5. It is fundamentally different from Roseanne comparing Jarrett to an ape, a racist locution w deep racist roots, bc unlike Bee\\'s deployment of cunt AGAINST a misogynistic, racist administration, Roseanne\\'s racism is deployed IN SUPPORT OF a racist, misogynistic administration..\\n6. that came to power in part on racist &amp; misogynistic rhetoric that vilified &amp; promised revenge against Obama administration of which Jarrett was a member &amp; which is using the power it so gained to inflict real world racist &amp; misogynistic harm on human beings.\\n7. Therefore, Roseanne\\'s utterance mirrors &amp; reinforces harm being inflicted by most powerful against least powerful, while Bee\\'s challenges that power dynamic\\n8. This also applies, of course, to faux-offense at Michelle Wolf, to cowering hobbits of the dark web &amp; to idea that metoo is a witch hunt and its critics have been unjustly silenced. NONE of that is real. NONE OF IT.\\n9. The illusion of persecution of the powerful is made possible by the powerful\\'s ability to fashion a public narrative around their own interests &amp; to normalize to the point of invisibility the ACTUAL harm done every day to the less powerful.\\n10. Cause remember kids, SHS can say w straight &amp; righteous face that a comedian being mean to Ivanka on TV is \"vile\" \"vicious\" \"appalling\" &amp; \"disgusting\" but would apply none of those descriptors to administration she\\'s fronting for, which takes CHILDREN AWAY FROM PARENTS.',\n",
       " 'When profs @Stanford launched an investigation of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific, I thought this might bring a reckoning akin to the slavery and justice projects at other universities. /1\\nUnder the direction of profs Gordon H. Chang and Shelley Fisher Fishkin, however, it became both more and less. It flourished into a 7-year transnational, interdisciplinary collaboration, a website, public history events, and two books. /2\\nhttps://t.co/4kKA3LOuGY\\nBut the larger project of recovering the experiences of Chinese RR workers—so important and necessary—dwarfed the question of Leland Stanford’s role and the University’s obligations. And the truth is there are no easy answers. /3\\nAs CA governor, Leland Stanford declared the Chinese “an inferior race,” calling for a “country settled by free white men.” As president of the CPRR, however, he turned to Chinese labor in desperation and justified his choice, describing the Chinese as “quiet” &amp; “industrious.” /4\\nAs many as 20,000 Chinese worked on the CPRR, tunneling through the Sierras. They earned less than white men and did more hazardous work. When they struck for higher wages in 1867, the CPRR cut off their supplies and starved them out. /5\\nBoth literally and figuratively, Chinese workers built Stanford University. First their backbreaking labor on the railroad built Stanford’s vast wealth. Then they helped to construct the university itself, including planting every tree on the iconic Palm Drive. /6\\n50 Chinese served the Stanfords in their private Palo Alto home, fed them &amp; nursed them through illness. The Stanfords grew fond of their Chinese servants &amp; gave gifts to a chosen few. /7\\nAt the same time, Leland Stanford championed Chinese Restriction &amp; Exclusion as a US senator, working to end Chinese migration. He denounced anti-Chinese violence in CA, but gave into vigilantes’ demands to lay off workers. /8\\nJust before he died in 1892, Stanford had second thoughts. “One time I had some fears of the Chinese overrunning the country, but for some years I have had none,” he said. “We need the Chinese here to work… I don’t know what we would do without them.” Faint praise, indeed. /9\\nIt feels easier to condemn slavery, and universities’ ties to it, than to condemn this blend of racism/nativism. Perhaps it’s easier to agree, in retrospect, that slavery was immoral, than it is to contemplate, in the present day, the ethics of immigrant labor exploitation. /end\\nRead more from Gordon H. Chang about the Chinese and the Stanfords:  https://t.co/F7UHstSn9E\\nRESPECT to the activists and historians who have worked on slavery &amp; justice projects. That is hard, ongoing work.

       " '--FAQ THREAD ABOUT THE NEW #Discord VIRUS--\\n\\nI wanna explain the virus as clearly as I can in this tweetstorm. Please, for the love of all good in the world, READ and spread this around. Literally anyone who uses @discordapp even a little should know this stuff.\\nADD TO THE LIST!!\\n1. How does it start?\\n\\nYou\\'ll get a DM from someone on your friends list, in a groupchat with you, and/or with mutual servers.\\nDON\\'T CLICK (obviously)\\n\\nThe DM seems to have multiple forms. I\\'ve seen two so far, if someone\\'s seen more, please do share: https://t.co/D153PiZ6T6\\n2. What is the link exactly?\\n\\nThe link is made to look like a legit Discord link--it\\'s not. It has Discord\\'s embed forged, and if you read the link closely, it\\'s not \"discord dot gg\" as Discord uses; rather, it\\'s \"discord gg dot ga\". This is meant to trip you up into clicking. https://t.co/7z7QRb2rQl\\n3. Where does the link lead to?\\n\\nThe link will take you to a fake login page. This is intricately forged to look EXACTLY like Discord\\'s plain login. The trick is that you think it\\'s a legit Discord login, so you put in your email &amp; pass like normal, thinking all is good till now.\\n4. What happens then?\\n\\nYour account is taken. In reality, you just gave your email &amp; pass to the system running this shit--and before you know it, a bot is now in your account. It locks you out by changing your pass &amp; email, so without 2FA you\\'re not getting back in anytime soon.\\n5. What does it do on my account?\\n\\nExactly what it did to you using your friends\\' account(s). The bot goes through your friends, DMs, server members, and groupchats, sending the same messages in hopes of tricking more &amp; more people &amp; gaining control of more accounts over Discord.\\n6. Why is this such a big deal?\\n\\nDiscord accounts hold a lot of info!! I\\'m sure a lot of people reading this have things on their account they wouldn\\'t want even friends seeing, let alone a virus.\\nAlso, for server staff &amp; owners, this means SERIOUS danger. Scary shit can go down.\\n7. I got the virus and my account is sending the link everywhere. What do I do?\\n\\n--Make a new account with a familiar name+pfp\\n--Reach out to as many trusted people from your old account (friends, server staff, etc.)\\n--Look for invites online of servers you were in that you trust\\n7. (cont)\\n\\n--In servers, reach out to trusted staff &amp; friends. Explain what happened calmly. Maybe have some way of proving it\\'s you\\n--Get a friend to help vouch to server staff/others that you really are you\\n--Ask for help getting in touch with other friends &amp; their Discord tags\\n8. I know/am friends with someone with the virus. What do I do?\\n\\n--Remove their old acct from all groupchats (see who\\'s group owner, they can remove)\\n--Unfriend &amp; tell others to unfriend\\n--Save anything you need from y\\'all\\'s DMs\\n--On their new acct, HELP them reach out to friends https://t.co/NEXddIi2Jr\\n9. I am staff of a server, and a member got the virus. What do I do?\\n\\n--Get the new acct into the server FIRST\\n--Copy over all roles/notes/perms to the new acct\\n--Give new acct any rewards/ranks etc (Bot EXP, guild score/rank, etc.) the old acct has\\n--Ban old acct without a purge https://t.co/NyYGhZHu2Z\\n10. How can we fight this?\\n\\n--2FA! 2FA! 2FA! It takes SECONDS. Enable it on your acct, encourage friends &amp; members to enable it!\\n--SEND REPORTS TO DISCORD! This is quite easily one of the scariest viruses to spread around Discord--if we push, they will stop it sooner than later!! https://t.co/NiT575wUMF',\n",
       " 'We spend a lot of time trying to figure out what makes startups explode out of the gates, and not nearly enough on what drives the “overnight successes, a decade in the making.” e.g. Lynda/MailChimp/Olo\\n\\nSome quick thoughts on what powers that type of entrepreneur:\\n\\n1/12\\n👓 Bi-focal Vision\\n\\nAll entrepreneurs claim to have \"vision.\" It\\'s easy to wax poetic about how tech will change the world in the coming years. Rare is the ability to pair that perspective with views on how to make the cash register ring in the next 30 days. 2/12\\n🐢 Patience\\n\\nThese companies are usually absurdly early entrants into their markets. The kind of founder who tries to solve mobile ordering two years before the iPhone. The SaaS merchant in an on-prem world. They often have more faith than sense. 3/12\\n⛏️ Willingness to toil\\n\\nBeing early means not having the luxury of easy capital. It usually means an endless stream of tough pilot projects &amp; test deployments. Grabbing revenue wherever it can be had. It\\'s hard, often demoralizing, but necessary. 4/12\\n⚙️ M-A-N-A-G-E-M-E-N-T\\n\\nVC-backed startups often have a laissez faire mode of management, but these founders believe in it and invest in it. They’re not micromanagers, but they do try instrument the business from its earliest days. Their survival depends on it.\\n\\n5/12\\n💊 Pain tolerance\\n\\nThese founders lose key hires to better-funded, higher-profile startups. Competitors raise more money and grow faster (until their faulty models fail). Family asks these entrepreneurs when they’re going to get a real job? \\nIt can be painful. \\nFor years. 6/12\\n🔥 Cheerleading\\n\\nI\\'ve been involved with a company in this mold for 14 years. TBH, I nearly wrote it off multiple times in the first six years. But whenever I got close, the founder reignited my excitement and did the same for the team. A true super power. 7/12\\n🏖️ Perspective\\n\\nThe difference between a $100M exit and a $1B exit is often just a three-week vacation. Some founders get burnt out after a decade of struggle and take the 1st credible offer for their startup. Just as their growth is about to go exponential. 8/12\\n🃏 Reputational risk tolerance\\n\\nAll startups are risky. But there\\'s a big difference between spending two years at a startup that fails and 10+. These founders define \"all-in\" and leave little room for \"pivoting\" their personal brands. 9/12\\nIt\\'s hard to spot these entrepreneurs. Aside from being \"too early\", many of these traits only present themselves well into the journey, but we should be more mindful about supporting them as they develop. 10/12\\nThese companies are often the least flashy in a portfolio. Because they rarely incite early bidding wars and can raise capital on their own terms later in life, they can also be hugely remunerative to founders and investors alike. 11/12\\nBeyond the financial consideration, these startups are intrinsically rewarding in the extreme. In an industry that includes jargon like \"flips\" and \"quick wins\", seeing a founder\\'s true vision come to life is so extremely gratifying. 12/12',\n",
       " 'This story about @JohnBelforLA signing his state\\'s just-passed heartbeat bill is rightly getting lots of attention. https://t.co/63o3JyDdM3 But, in many ways, it is getting the wrong kind of attention and this points to a major flaw in how abortion is covered in the US. 1/\\nEdwards is a strong pro-life Democrat; expanded Medicaid, increased education funding, instituted criminal justice reform. \\n\\nMore than 12 Dems voted for the heartbeat bill. Several are people of color...like @RepKJackson. This is mirrors a (local) trend https://t.co/m1pYu97R0S 2/\\nNational media don\\'t know what to do with this. Instead of allowing racial/ideological diversity to challenge their given abortion narrative, they reply on 1980s stereotypes. Of Jackson they said \"Her party’s preferences are no match for her own deeply held religious beliefs.\" 3/\\nDismissiveness drips from these words. \"Deeply held religious beliefs\" are put in a box which gets marginalized from the discourse. Magisterial figures like Linda Greenhouse even argue the establishment clause prohibits them from being basis of law. https://t.co/nnHpkQRsFw 4/\\nThis methodology is only employed, of course, when the views in question are objectionable. When @PeteButtigieg says his faith guides his views about, say, ecological protection...there is no dismissiveness. His religious language is either overlooked or framed positively. 5/\\nIt would be impossible imagine a @WashingtonPost reporter penning this sentence: \"Though most US Americans don\\'t prioritize climate change the priorities of the American people are no match for Mayor Pete\\'s religious beliefs.\" One might argue that the moral view of climate...  6/\\n...change has a secular component to the argument and that\\'s what makes it different. But the same is true with abortion, which most pro-lifers see as about human rights. Pope Francis recent remarks on justice for the prenatal child explicitly frame it in non-religious terms. 7/\\n.@secularprolife recently pointed out that a whopping 13 million pro-lifers ID as non-religious. *13 million*! https://t.co/Td7aW2tAPo This group is equal to the entire population of Illinois. The idea that an anti-abortion position is inherently religious is totally outdated. 8/\\nThe WaPo article also assumes abortion-rights Dem party orthodoxy throughout, but this is true only with coastal, overwhelmingly white elites. The full party, esp if one takes religious people of color seriously,  one must embrace diversity on this issue. At least if Dems... 9/\\n...want to win in places like South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas. Indeed, pro-life messaging works best with what some might call the Dem\\'s base. https://t.co/JvCltAH6A7 \\n\\nWaPo article suggested Dem party changed on abortion, but its more accurate to say pro-lifers left. 10/\\nDems will desperately need to win them back if they want to win the Senate and to keep the House in 2020. Many pro-lifers are looking around for alternatives to Trump, but white progressive leadership doesn\\'t give them anywhere reasonable to land. Many will simply stay home. 11/\\nHaving a national debate about this, though, requires changing abortion coverage. Let go of 1980s assumptions. Embrace wide nonbinary view of the issue. Talk at length with locals outside of I-95 corridor, especially people of color. And most important: embrace complexity. [fin]',\n",

I’ve had a number of people ask why, or seem surprised, so I thought I’d lay out my rationale in case it is of interest to others.\\nOver the years I converged on what we call coin maximalism, or minimalism. That is, “blockchain” was developed to solve a very specific problem, and it did so at a massive sacrifice. That problem: ensuring that ledger entries can’t be double spent when there’s no central party.\\nIf you can create a central party, don’t use a “blockchain”. If you don’t believe that ledger entry has value, don’t use it.\\nThat ledger entry, like money, has value through mass belief. So I believe we’ll converge around one.\\nIn this case, bitcoin is the one to beat.\\nLast August, I left EY with the goal of starting a business to assist with adoption of bitcoin in one of two ways: helping institutionalize it, or helping adoption in the developing world. I covered my views on this in this article: https://t.co/djXaltSOYz\\nI quickly worked out that I’m not going to be able to build bitcoin adoption in the developing world. I will never know enough about it, and additionally: you fundamentally can’t build a legitimate business that is also decentralized to resist government intervention.\\nI also found that institutions were not going to be onboarding bitcoin as a financial product as quickly as I had thought they would from my discussions over the years. Institutionalization has happened, but not as much as I’d expected and enough for me to build a business on it.\\nThere are some fantastic companies making great strides with bitcoin adoption in the institutional and consumer space. It is, however, in my view crowded for the state of the market as it stands now.\\nYou also can’t rush people to believe that something has value.\\nFinally, I have believed for the past few years that there would be a ‘great cleansing’, where over a period of a year or two, people would slowly withdraw from all the useless blockchain projects going on.

(1)\\n... a crime was committed, a very serious crime: a computer hack. It\\'s no less a burglary for stealing digital rather than physical property. Same crime as Watergate. (2)\\nAll the way back in the summer of 2016, everybody knew who committed this crime:  Russian military intelligence. Claims that maybe it was an \"inside job\" etc. were floated in bad faith by untruthful people - but everybody knew, the Trump campaign very much included. (3)\\nWhen Donald Trump Jr. accepted his famous Trump Tower meeting, he was hoping to receive the proceeds of a crime. He was disappointed in that hope, but that\\'s what he hoped. (4)\\nAnd when the proceeds of the crime did begin to be posted on the WikiLeaks site later in the summer of 2016 and -devastatingly - less than 1 hour after the reporting of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016, everybody understand that this was Putin acting to help Trump (5)\\nNone of this bears any resemblance to \"oppo research\" - information obtained lawfully by asking questions, reading archives, etc. It was crime, no less criminal for being outsourced to foreigners beyond the reach of US prosectors (6)\\nThe Mueller report found insufficient evidence to convict anyone on the Trump campaign of culpability in the crime. But it stressed: the crime was committed by Russian military intelligence to help Trump, and the Trump campaign knowingly welcomed that help (7)\\nIf the Trump campaign had flown a private investigator to Moscow to interview people about the (bogus) Uranium One Clinton story ... nobody would object. That is oppo research. If they trawled old Arkansas police records in search of something discrediting ... again, research (8)\\nWhat fellow Republicans first and then Democrats later hired Christopher Steele to do - interview people, collect rumors, sift through them - falls into this former category. The quality of Steele\\'s work you can dispute. He committed no crimes in course of doing it. (9)\\nTrump Jr\\'s visitors in June 2016 purported to deliver - and Trump\\'s actual helpers later in the year did actually deliver - the proceeds of crimes. In full light of day, and with Trump on video urging them onward. (10)\\nThe Trump campaign was absolved of criminal culpability by Mueller in large part on issue o intent. Did they truly understand they were being invited to participate in a crime? Did they truly wish to participate? And could that be proven beyond reasonable doubt? (11)\\nThat\\'s why President Trump\\'s words to ABC were so important. He was asked, now that you have full knowledge of all that was at issue - including the crime committed by the Putin regime by hacking Americans - would you receive that information again?

With growing support for a people\\'s vote, I\\'d like to explain why it must be a @FinalSayForAll 1/\\nIn the 2016 referendum #The5Million most directly affected were excluded from voting. This must not be allowed to happen again in any new vote that has such a direct impact on our lives. 2/\\nLet\\'s first remind ourselves why it was decided to exclude #The5Million. EU27 in the UK were excluded on the grounds of citizenship. UK in the EU for 15+ years, were excluded on the grounds of residency. 3/\\nWhile it may be acceptable to decide the franchise based on one of these, to use both reasons to exclude a total of 5 million people isn\\'t acceptable in a democracy. 4/\\nI\\'ve often been told that to include one or, ideally, both of these groups in the franchise would be \"moving the goalposts\". There are several reasons why I don\\'t agree with that premise 5/\\nThe people\\'s vote is NOT a re-run of the 2016 referendum, but a NEW vote based on a NEW set of facts and circumstances. Therefore, it\\'s not necessary to keep the same old franchise as the 2016 opinion poll 6/\\nIn fact, it is impossible to keep the same franchise, as it has already changed. Some ppl have sadly died, many others have reached voting age since 23.06.16. A franchise is as dynamic as democracy and the will of the people. If the latter can change, then so can the franchise 7/\\nOf all the promises made &amp; reneged upon, one promise was made by BOTH the leave and remain campaigns: that EU27 in UK &amp; UK in EU would keep the exact same rights. Thus, no one voted for them to lose any rights. The goalposts were not only moved, they were removed altogether 8/\\nThe argument that only UK citizens should have a say in this UK matter is entirely negated by the fact that \\nCommonwealth citizens and citizens of Cyprus and Malta were able to vote. I don\\'t begrudge anyone their vote, but I demand the same right. 9/\\nLeavers have called the EU a \\'dictatorship\\' and argue that the UK referendum was democratic. Yet, ironically, there was no democracy in the UK  for the #The5Million who are being dictated to by a gov that we can\\'t hold to account 10/\\nAlongside the colleagues already mentioned, the FSFA Foundation has a group of dedicated volunteers who give their time &amp; expertise to help us reach our goal. Together we\\'ve organised many events &amp; are currently organising more. See @FinalSayForAll for more info. 11/\\nWe\\'re currently updating our website https://t.co/Ao4uJ0DkIs to include more about our more recent activities, but please visit it to find out more about what we do &amp; perhaps you may wish to make a donation to help us with our current #BrexitIsPersonal project 12/\\nSo my fellow remainers, campaigners and activists, when you demand a people\\'s vote, please demand a people\\'s vote for ALL. To include #The5Million in a #FinalSayForAll would only enhance democracy. Especially poignant in the year in which we celebrate 100 years of suffrage 13/',\n",

Few members of Congress have read the report.\\nI offer these conclusions only after having read Mueller’s redacted report carefully and completely, having read or watched pertinent statements and testimony, and having discussed this matter with my staff, who thoroughly reviewed materials and provided me with further analysis.\\nIn comparing Barr’s principal conclusions, congressional testimony, and other statements to Mueller’s report, it is clear that Barr intended to mislead the public about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s analysis and findings.\\nBarr’s misrepresentations are significant but often subtle, frequently taking the form of sleight-of-hand qualifications or logical fallacies, which he hopes people will not notice.\\nUnder our Constitution, the president “shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” While “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” is not defined, the context implies conduct that violates the public trust.\\nContrary to Barr’s portrayal, Mueller’s report reveals that President Trump engaged in specific actions and a pattern of behavior that meet the threshold for impeachment.\\nIn fact, Mueller’s report identifies multiple examples of conduct satisfying all the elements of obstruction of justice, and undoubtedly any person who is not the president of the United States would be indicted based on such evidence.\\nImpeachment, which is a special form of indictment, does not even require probable cause that a crime (e.g., obstruction of justice) has been committed; it simply requires a finding that an official has engaged in careless, abusive, corrupt, or otherwise dishonorable conduct.\\nWhile impeachment should be undertaken only in extraordinary circumstances, the risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ it as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct.\\nOur system of checks and balances relies on each branch’s jealously guarding its powers and upholding its duties under our Constitution. When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution, the Rule of Law—the foundation of liberty—crumbles.\\nWe’ve witnessed members of Congress from both parties shift their views 180 degrees—on the importance of character, on the principles of obstruction of justice—depending on whether they’re discussing Bill Clinton or Donald Trump.\\nFew members of Congress even read Mueller’s report; their minds were made up based on partisan affiliation—and it showed, with representatives and senators from both parties issuing definitive statements on the 448-page report’s conclusions within just hours of its release.\\nAmerica’s institutions depend on officials to uphold both the rules and spirit of our constitutional system even when to do so is personally inconvenient or yields a politically unfavorable outcome. Our Constitution is brilliant and awesome; it deserves a government to match it.',\n",

Probably not...\\nThe backlash against service mesh, K8S, and other ☁️ native tech is based, reasonably IMO, on the view that vendor marketing and big tech thought-leading are causing  smaller orgs to not see the forest for the trees and adopt solutions that are too complex for their actual needs.\\nIf you have a new/small distributed system:\\n✔️ Monolith\\n✔️ Untyped language/API, go wild\\n✔️ Monorepo, why not\\n✔️ ☁️ FaaS, yes please\\n✔️ MongoDB? Web scale\\n✖️ Service mesh\\n✖️ K8S\\n✖️ Anything else that anyone thought-leads about on here.\\nFocus on creating customer value and keep things as simple and boring as possible for as long as possible.\\n\\nBUT, if you are lucky enough to find success, your development team will grow, you will end up moving to SoA, and then the 💩 will hit the fan:\\n- Untyped languages and APIs won\\'t feel so productive anymore.\\n- That monorepo? Don\\'t even get me started.\\n- Today\\'s state of the art FaaS is not going to cut it in terms of reliability, obs, networking, etc.\\n- You WILL start feeling the SoA networking/obs pain.\\nAt this point, the \"service mesh\" is coming for you one way or the other because the problems of obs, load balancing, service discovery, consistent timeouts, retries, etc. must be solved or your SoA is DOA.\\nAre you an all Java shop? Finagle or Hystrix are great choices. Are you an all Go shop? Try something like Micro. Are you polyglot? You can either plow a ⛰️ of resources into custom libraries in every language, or you can embrace the sidecar. Solutions must be found.\\nBut remember, VERY few companies get here. Make damn sure you need the networking complexity you are about to take on, because no matter what the vendors/conferences tell you, there will be pain, and nothing comes for free.\\nIs it always going to be this way? I don\\'t think so. I actually think we are in a bridge period in which the average engineer has to directly interact with technologies like Envoy and K8S to succeed at SoA.\\nI am a firm believer that in the 10 year timeframe, FaaS is all anyone will interact with.

He is who he was before taking power. Corruption? Mismanagement? Erratic hiring and firing? Constant random outbursts of temper? Narcissistic boasting? Barely-coded racism?

McMaster and even Tillerson pushed out, Kelly marginalized, etc. Trump is so awful that he makes even someone like Sessions look kind of good\\nWorsening the situation is that Trump is (rightly!) terrified of investigations into his business practices. Whatever he did w/ Russia, it’s been clear that the “Trump Organization” is just a front for fairly inept white collar crime, particularly money laundering, for a while\\nThe New Yorker piece by @adamdavidson lays this out clearly, but it’s been obvious to anyone who looked at his business since long before the election, and both Mueller’s team and the SDNY will have no difficulty following the money\\nAdditionally, whether or not Trump has underlying health issues, the Presidency itself is likely changing him by exaggerating his underlying tendencies (power tends to make people worse) and insulating him from any feedback that might tend to moderate his behavior\\nWhile Trump’s staff is increasingly a mixture of sycophants willing to tell him what he wants to hear, ambitious Republicans willing to do anything for short-term career advancement, true believers like Miller, and a shrinking handful of patriots trying to mitigate the damage\\nThis plus his increasing age (https://t.co/n60VE7ZUmv) means that Trump’s own tendencies (the narcissism, rage, lack of self-control, reactive responses to any challenge, use of racial political appeals, managerial incoherence, etc.) are going to get even more exaggerated\\nThis is not a hopeful story. So far, like a wealthy family living off its capital, the US government has maintained some level of functionality through institutional memory, the strength of the civil service, luck, and Jim Mattis. But this will get harder w/ each passing day\\nWith Trump feeling Mueller’s hot breath on the back of his neck and the SDNY clearly deep into another, perhaps even-more threatening to him investigation, the increasing pressure will only add to the toxic stew inside the White House\\nThere will be a rupture.

       " 'Seeing as how CNN, Newsweek and the New York Times can’t do any decent reporting on the Trumps, here’s my puff piece on Donnie:\\n\\nDonald J. Trump is a privileged and mentally deficient petty conman and all-round shitlord born in 1946. Having inherited a ton of cash but no brains\\nfrom his walking psycho’s gun license photo of a father, he spent his formative years punching teachers and diligently fostering a constellation of horrible psychological disorders. In the early 70s Donald bitched out of Vietnam with leg rot to become a full-time pervert and\\nthieving racist slum lord under the tutelage of his mooching dad. In 1977, he made a formal commitment to ruin the life of model Ivana Zelnickoya Winklmayr by marrying her. The couple then ruined the lives of three children by creating them. Around the time these lovebirds were\\nsmashing out a string of pointless clones, Donnie was sniffing around the gambling business. He got land in Atlantic City, promptly built fifty mobbed-up casinos on the same street, and ran them into the ground where they mouldered like dusty golden blocks of cheese, tragic\\nmonuments to the greed and epic stupidity of a morally and financially bankrupt opportunist. In the nineties, DJT was so in hock he had less money than any of the minorities he hated but that didn’t stop him tossing bank loans around like confetti at a series of piss-worthless\\nbusiness ventures going into the 2010s. These included an airline, a mortgage company, a cosplay university course, a magazine, a board game, and vodka and steak brands, all of which shit the bed faster than a motel drunk on a suicide booze jaunt to Ebola Town. Somewhere along\\nthe fucking way, he managed to impregnate one American lady no one remembers and the haunted plastic robot that remains his wife to this day. The resulting offspring have appeared very infrequently, and only in blurry photographs from a distance like the ones of\\nBigfoot. In 2016, after years fronting a moistly ego-driven ode to sociopathy called The Apprentice, The Donald was propelled to the White House on a wave of bigotry, Russian propaganda, shit media coverage, apathy, and voter suppression. He has spent every waking moment\\nsince then cheating at golf, tweeting typos on a greasy phone, and struggling with umbrellas while the urine-hued foot-long cotton candy he erroneously refers to as a haircut tries to flee the Chernobyl wildlife autopsy of his vindictively butchered scalp. Meanwhile, he’s\\ntrashed the State Department and EPA while hurling stacks of money at the people who need it the very least. Hate crimes are up, real wages stagnant, and the number of chronically confused dunces braying for a wall about the same as in 2016. Perhaps they will achieve their goal\\nof creating a vast and oil-filled forced birth pit to roll around in, protected by an ugly circular concrete barrier mounted with cheap machine gun installations and bathed in lung-shredded smog and acid rain. There they will wallow, bellowing hallucinated false claims about\\npallets of hostage cash and adrenochrome-harvesting pizza joints with fictional basements, riddled with malignant glyphosate tumours and bragging about an extra dollar in their monthly paychecks. We do not yet know what will become of their mad king Donnie, Prince of Whales, but\\nexperts predict he’ll either nuke us all or throw a blood clot around ’21, leaving behind a brittle and shell-shocked country crawling with emboldened crooks and insane conservative judges.\\n\\nI tried to remain as unbiased as possible in the writing of this article.',\n",
       " 'THREAD: I want to take a moment to elaborate why we should be so concerned that Jim Clapper, John Brennan, Admiral McRaven, Mike Hayden, and other officials feel it necessary to speak out against Trump:\\n1) Lost amid the controversy last week about Trump yanking Brennan\\'s security clearance is just how unusual it is for any of these officials to be speaking publicly—and that fact alone should be cause for concern....\\n2) This is no ordinary political criticism. Do not fall into Trump\\'s trap that this is just more of the same, more partisan sniping from the Swamp from swamp creatures....\\n3) These officials are not—repeat not—monetizing their security clearances by being on cable TV. In fact, having covered many of these officials for years, I can tell you that they would prefer to be doing anything but being on TV.\\n4) What they are doing is offering the clearest warning they can, speaking—as intel officials are supposed to do—truth to power, telling hard truths, that America faces a dire situation.\\n5) I spent months profiling Jim Clapper when he was DNI; back then, he went out of his way to say nothing, to avoid controversy, to eschew politics, to focus on the work before him. https://t.co/yALqFbVHDt\\n6) All of them would have preferred to sit on the sidelines of politics. They spent their careers avoiding it and would prefer to remain off the public radar.\\n7) All Clapper wanted to do when he left office was slip quietly into the night and clean out his basement. He\\'d been retired before—for six years—and never did TV commentary or cable news before. But those were \"normal\" years, under Clinton and W.\\n8) Altogether, Clapper spent nearly 50 years in public service. Hayden did about 40 years. McRaven 36. Brennan too, more than 30. These are not partisan hacks. They don\\'t scare easily. They don\\'t cry wolf.\\n8) All of them were trained to keep quiet on politics. So the fact that they\\'re not silent, that all of them—all of them—are screaming from the rooftops about Trump\\'s threats to our country, our rule of law, our democratic institutions, should chill us. https://t.co/tzEvZlf5jI\\n9) I was there last summer at @aspensecurity as Clapper and Brennan let loose on Trump. I was gobsmacked. I had read every word Jim Clapper has said in public in a decade. I had never imagined I\\'d hear him speak as ominously and fearfully as he did. https://t.co/Se8XRqFhJd\\n10) I remain stunned by the words and warning that come from Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, McRaven, and others today.\\n11) They are telling us this is a dark and dangerous time. And they have spent their lives, devoted their entire careers, to protecting the country from just these sorts of events overseas. That they\\'re warning us we\\'re under threat at *home*. That\\'s a warning worth listening to.',\n",

       " '1) ATTENTION EVERYONE. \\n\\nA MASSIVE little snippet Mueller snuck into his statement that I somehow overlooked. This confirms my overall thesis on Mueller’s involvement in other ongoing investigations and the fact that MUELLER LOOKED INTO THE OTHER SIDE!\\n\\nWatch this clip and read! https://t.co/Ye7bPuL0OF\\n2) This is clouded legal speak that is hard for regular folk to catch up on. Let’s break it down.\\n\\n“Our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office”\\n\\nMueller’s product from his work is being decided on in an office separate from the SC.\\n3) Read that again.\\n\\nMueller’s product is being reviewed elsewhere and the decision on what to do with his findings are being “decided” on by other entities.\\n\\nMueller is referring to all these “unspecified criminal investigations” as seen in the Flynn sentencing memo!\\n\\nSee below. https://t.co/12YT1Ha4WR\\n4) The dems/MSM assumed that the “unspecified criminal investigations” had something to do with Trump/Russia. Even though in the Flynn memo it clearly states that the criminal investigation is separate from the Mueller Russian interference SC.\\n\\nFolks, Mueller found something.\\n5) But what he found had fallen outside the scope of his investigation, which was specifically “Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election”. \\n\\nMueller found this in his 19 interviews with Flynn in which Flynn was required to give knowledge of “any and all crimes”. https://t.co/tRh8sRqC3z\\n6) General Flynn, white hat/Q team, knows a plethora of crimes ranging from Uranium One to the Weiner Laptop.\\n\\nWhen we talk about “legal injection” this is what we mean.\\n\\nFlynn purposefully caught a minor process charge so he could testify about EVERYTHING!\\n\\nHUGE Q PROOF! 👇🏻 https://t.co/bmyH096Ght\\n7) What Mueller said in this presser confirms what was already in the documentation. He found crimes, and those crimes were handed off to other investigators. \\n\\nWhen he says “a process that does not involve our office”, I cannot confirm who he is referring to. Huber? Durham? Idk.\\n8) What I do know is that if Flynn gave Mueller all crimes with which he was familiar, and those interviews assisted in multiple ongoing criminal investigations, and those investigations are SEPARATE from the Mueller/Russia SC, THAT LEAVES ONE POSSIBILITY.\\n\\nThe other side. #PAIN https://t.co/3EJkQuMaYl\\n9) This is huge. This confirms everything. This confirms Mueller was conducting a fair investigation and looked into matters on both sides.\\n\\nNow the SC is done, Trump team is clear, and the ongoing criminal investigations with sitting grand juries continue to work in the shadows.\\n10) So the options are:\\n\\nMueller is a white/grey hat who investigated both sides.\\n\\nOr \\n\\nMueller is a black hat, running a coup from within Trump’s own DOJ, yet failed to damage Trump and accidentally investigated his own side.\\n\\nHe’s either a white hat or the worst black hat ever.\\n11) This is the reason I am so calm and so confident in the situation is because I know the legality and I know that there are multiple ongoing criminal investigations into the other side and Mueller assisted in these findings. \\n\\nMueller is our guy. He has been since 5/17/17.\\n12) In summary, We got a member of Q team (Flynn) to testify about all crimes with which he was familiar and Mueller handed it off to other criminal investigations. Mueller assisted in gathering information that will prosecute the deep state.\\n\\n“LEGAL INJECTION” https://t.co/mMzov7YL74\\n13) Huge shoutout to @GodandCountry11 \\n\\nShe is the one who found this little detail that I managed to overlook amidst the pandemonium of the past couple days. \\n\\nShare this thread far and wide.

       " '1/ Some things keep me awake, others keep me on edge. Yesterday I talked about the \"empathy shock\" or the \"alterity crack\" with @rogerdodger1180 . Today is my daughter\\'s birthday.\\n2/ I never mention her name or location on social media, I am scared to death that someone will touch her and it hasn\\'t changed much for the past 30 years. I told Roger that I remembered seeing many copies of her, except they were Kurds, when Saddam Hussein attacked them.\\n3/ All those little dead bodies were copies of my baby and the shock of seeing that was harder than dealing with real children in extreme poverty in the slums of Brazil. I held many. I wasn\\'t a mother yet, though.\\n4/ Later on, when she was about 7 or 8, we stopped for bathroom and drinks on our way to see my sister. We lived in Blacksburg, VA where I was a visiting scholar and the road crossed the Apalachians.\\n5/ We stopped at this place where a dozen men wearing hats and women on flowery dresses turned their white heads to look at my brown child. The alarm reactions kicked in instantly. A mother will kill to protect her baby.\\n6/ When she was about to be born, I threatened the physician. He was trying to get me to accept the common maternity baby room when we had an agreement that I was in the common room program (mother and child in the same room).\\n7/ He was scared. My daughter\\'s father was scared. Then she was born and they put the crib a few feet from my bed. I forced them to put it right next to it. My baby - my rules. I also remember paranoid thoughts about what to do if somebody tried to steal her.\\n8/ \"Is it possible to insert a chip in the baby\\'s body so that we can locate her at any time?\" People looked at me a bit scared. This lasted just a couple of days. I didn\\'t let people hold her except my close family. I didn\\'t allow visits during the first month.\\n9/ Then, during the last Carnaval, the fascist police attacked her party block in Brazil. She was hurt. The policemen were put on leave and the district is being sued. They will lose. Good. But that day and the days that followed, I felt helpless and desperate.\\n10/ When I see the cages at the South border, all the kids look like my baby to me. Why? No clue. The image of innocent refugee children murder, the little girl with a pink blouse, looks exactly like my baby. I can see her.\\n11/ That\\'s the alterity shock. The victim is you, or, worse, your child. You need to do something about it. And yes, that also comes with anger, powerlessness and hate: I hate the ICE agents. I know that I wish they were hurt.\\n12/ I am a good social scientist. The USCIS agreed with this, too: I have the whore-visa.. oops, sorry, the EB-1A visa (the one Melania screwed up for us). I know that the proper definition is \"concentration camp\".\\n13/ It goes beyond that, though. I will think about my baby the whole day today. It\\'s her birthday. Yesterday was the funeral of a boy who killed himself here in Red America. It was also supposed to be the terrorist ICE raid against immigrant families ordered by Trump.\\n14/ The empathy shock creates dark thoughts in my mind. I will try to focus on my baby\\'s birthday and on the hope that some day Trump, Nielsen, Miller and their crew will be sitting at the International Court at the Hague answering for crimes against Humanity.',\n",

On Aug. 4, 2016 Stone sent an email to Nunberg and said \"I dined with Julian Assange last night,\". The WSJ has a copy of hte email. Now the gaslighting nutjob liar is saying \"The email means nothing bc I didn\\'t go\". Good luck with that.\\n3. Stone is all \"I never dined with Assange, the email doesn\\'t have any significance. This was said in jest\" Sure, Jan. Explain that to Mueller.\\n4. Kindly note: Mueller\\'s team has asked about Stone\\'s email during testimony before a Grand Jury. This means the matter is dead serious.\\n5. I find it highly unlikely that Mueller would waste the GJ time with suggestions about an email problem unless he believed the claim had merit. So yeah, not buying it. And also, the below. LOL.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/ILQ9SXVa2I\\n6. And let\\'s not forget Stone has been widely inconsistent in his statements about WIkiLeaks and Assange. Not to mention the day after the dinner he is laughably trying to deny, Stone tweeted: \"Hillary lies about RU involvement in DNC hack - Julian Assange is a hero\".\\n7. THREE DAYS after that, Stone told a GOP group in Florida that he had communicated with ASsange, and that he believed more damaging docs about HRC would be released in months to come. \"There\\'s no telling what the Oct. Surprise may be. But hey, no meeting.\\n8. Mind you, even if Stone only had a Skype tete à tete with Assange, instead of dinner in  person, it\\'s not like that would put him in a better position. It appears evident he communicated with Assange, and we KNOW he did with Russian GRU Guccifer.\\n9. The point here is cooperation or rather conspiracy between Trump Associates and Russia. Kind reminder that WIkileaks even per Trump lackey and Putin stooge POMPEO is nothing but a Kremlin front.\\n10. So whether Stone went to dine with Assange in person, used Whatsapp to chat, Skype or whatever else, the result is the exact same. That\\'s cooperation and conspiracy with the Kremlin to spread stolen material in order to influence the election.\\n11. Days before Stone\\'s claim to have dined with Assange, the WSJ notes, Trump himself called upon Russia to steal and release Clinton\\'s emails (there, I fixed it for you WSJ).\\n12. Stone is all \"I neeevah evah talked about Wikileaks disclosures with Trump!\". That\\'s right, bozo, you discussed the strategy to release them and how to get them, not the disclosure per se.\\n13. Another kind reminder that Stone is so foolish as to have posted screenshots of Twitter DMs he exchanged with Guccifer, meaning the GRU. I mean we know Stone isn\\'t the brightest or most stable person, but this is a peak of foolishness evn for him.\\n14. To conclude, when Mueller\\'s GJ asks about an email referencing dinner with Assange, they\\'re looking for ANY possible confirmation of contact, not just that contact specifically. So, Stone? Better get a VERY good lawyer. #MuellerIsComing /END.',\n",

During the shutdown, drugs entered from other pathways and users turned to different narcotics. /5\\nLater, the notorious G. Gordon Liddy, who helped devise the plan, called Operation Intercept an \"exercise in international extortion.\" The goal was to pressure Mexican officials into cooperating with the U.S. /6\\nHere is Liddy: \"The Mexicans, using diplomatic language of course, told us to go piss up a rope. The Nixon administration didn\\'t believe in the United States\\' taking crap from any foreign government.

He's called Putin's Chef because Concord Management has the catering contracts for the Russian Ministry of Defense. #SudanUprising\\nWhen I say Prigozhin was a pimp, I mean he was convicted of trafficking a 13-year-old girl. When I say he was a thief, I mean he beat up a woman and stole her coat, shoes, and earrings. Now his Wagner Group provides protection for Sudan's dictator Bashir. #SudanUprising\\nIn the U.S., Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted Prigozhin and his Concord Management company (which is a front for Russian organized crime), for using hackers and trolls to help elect Trump. (They also deal in kompromat and blackmail.) #SudanUprising\\nConcord Management is an umbrella organization, through which Russian organized crime boss Prigozhin controls hackers &amp; trolls (such as the Internet Research Agency that boosted Trump) and the Wagner Group (an arm of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU). #SudanUprising\\nPeople in the U.S. have no idea that Prigozhin, who has been indicted along with his mobbed up Concord Managment in the Trump-Russia investigation, is also running Russian military intelligence operatives (the Wagner Group) to prop up Bashir in Sudan. #SudanUprising\\nFormer Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer Dmitry Utkin founded the Wagner Group, financed and controlled by Prigozhin as part of the organized crime front known as Concord Management. Prigozhin named Utkin to Concord Management's board of directors. #SudanUprising\\nUtkin recruited Ukrainian soldiers and sailors to work for the Wagner Group in Sudan, in exchange for Russian citizenship. They arrive in Khartoum on Russian military planes, which park by the VIP terminal. These paramilitary forces spy on peaceful protestors. #SudanUprising\\nThe Wagner Group also guards Sudan's gold mines, diamond mines, and uranium mines, as well as the atomic energy facilities which Russia is building in Sudan. Bashir has given Prigozhin and the Wagner Group ownership interests in Sudan's mines. #SudanUprising\\nOn paper, it initially appears that Sudanese companies own the gold, diamond, and uranium mines in Sudan. But when you investigate, you find that the Sudanese companies are actually owned and controlled by Prigozhin's Russian companies, such as M Invest. #SudanUprising\\nSudan's dictator Bashir has given the Russian organized crime boss Prigozhin and his Wagner Group thugs the gold, diamond, and uranium mines that represent the natural heritage of Sudan's youth. And Russia is building a military base in Port Sudan. Tasgut bas. #SudanUprising\\nThis is Yevgeny Prigozhin. This is the face of Russian colonialism in Sudan. This is the man who owns Bashir. He is actually just what he started out to be -- a pimp and a thief. He is vulnerable. So is the Wagner Group in Sudan. That's why they are hiding. #SudanUprising https://t.co/YdYaErIz3X\\nPrigozhin's Wagner Group of Russian military intelligence operatives used to stroll about Khartoum, buying running shoes at the Shoe Mall, training Sudanese armed forces and police, and driving Russian military trucks.

JWR confirmed nothing illegal occurred. Some facts that contradict JWR narrative.... 1/X\\n2.Lead prosecutor recommended the use of the DPA tool. The Director of Prosecutions overturned the decision. JWR confirmed prosecution. JWR did not document her legal analysis supporting the rejection of the DPA.  JWR contention that due diligence was exercised was not documented\\n3/X Given public interest/importance of high profile cases &amp; associated risks, JWR appeared to treat this case in a routine manner. SNC Lavalin, 2nd largest engineering firm in the world with over 60,000 employees and $12 Billlion in world revenues, would be offered a DPA if\\n4/X in any other 5 eyes country (UK, France, Australia and US). SNC Lavalin has requested a judicial review of the decision not to negotiate a DPA. It appears that JWR prefers prosecutions over DPAs in principle. The suggestion of bringing in an external  legal expert to review\\n5/X the applicability of the DPA option that was rejected was completely valid given there is no expertise on DPAs within the Ministry of Justice since it is a new tool/law in Canada. JWR appeared to take offence at the idea that someone would be more qualified to review the case\\n6 than her yet she only had 4 years of experience working in the Vancouver DTES Office (drug crimes etc) as a junior prosecutor, in addition to her role within the BC FN Org. It is my contention that JWR &amp; PMO overestimated her legal acumen, communication, mgmt &amp; political skills\\n7/X JWR is a Rookie Politician/Minister. Besides having 4 chiefs of staff in 3 years, poor performance per political rivals &amp; the legal profession, JWR's conduct &amp; motivations are at question given indications that she was rigid, myopic, stubborn &amp; not a team player.\\n8/X JWR failed to report any ethical violations to the Ethics Commissioner over a 4 month period which involved discussions in mid Sept, mid Oct and mid December. She contends that she felt inappropriate pressure that mounted and in December is when she felt the most pressure.\\n9/X Yet, JWR only spoke about pressure to PM Trudeau on Sept 17th &amp; January 7th when she was told about the cabinet shuffle. JWR did not report this inappropriate pressure in Dec or offer her resignation at any point in accordance with cabinet convention.\\n10/X JWR accepted a new cabinet post January 14th after being advised of the shuffle on January 7th; thereby proving JWR had confidence in the PM, PMO &amp; cabinet. Again, this is in contravention to her claim, after the fact, that she was subject to inappropriate pressure.\\n11/X JWR had the option to resign and did not do so in accordance with the common law convention called the Shawcross Doctrine. No judgement or decisions should be made until the Ethics Commissioner reviews the case.\\n12/X Also, the results of the judicial review of the SNC Lavalin DPA denial should be considered since there may have been malicious prosecutorial action on the part of the Crown.\\n13/X It seems obvious now that the PM/PMO/PCO lost confidence in JWR over a period of time (pre SNCL) for the reasons noted above. Intransigence, entitlement &amp; political nativity make for difficult relationships.\\n* 13/X Spelling correction: naivety. Just a word of thanks to everyone for the retweets &amp; kind words.

       " '1. Is there any reason for hope?  I suggest there is. I want to return to Tuesday’s court hearing. Trump’s lawyer argued that Congress cannot issue subpoenas to investigate presidential violations of the law.  Judge Mehta plainly and inarguably disagreed with that position. . .\\n2. Without recounting every observation by Judge Mehta, he made it crystal clear that it’s proper, indeed necessary, for Congress to investigate presidential violations of statutes, presidential violations of the Constitution (the judge specifically mentioned . . .\\n3. the emoluments clause) and presidential conflicts of interest (the judge referenced a president having a financial interest in the legislation he supports or other actions he takes while in office). Indeed, it was so obvious that Judge Mehta would rule . . .\\n4. against Trump’s position &amp; in favor of the House Oversight Committe’s position that, at the end of the hearing, Trump’s lawyer said as much (asking the judge to stay/delay his order from taking effect until Trump’s lawyer could appeal the ruling he expected to go against him).\\n5. Just yesterday, the White House Counsel issued a letter essentially taking the same (losing) position that Trump’s lawyers took in court on Tuesday. Why do I interpret this as a hopeful sign?  Because, IMO, the state of our judiciary remains strong. Notwithstanding . . .\\n6. the administration’s obvious stonewalling, these matters will move into and be resolved by the courts. After 30 years, appearing before more than 100 judges, I firmly believe that our judiciary remains dedicated to the rule of law. Even more importantly . . .\\n7. the judiciary will not endure or endorse a criminal president or a corrupt administration. Now, we’re rightly concerned about the packing of the courts with conservative judges. But every conservative administration appoints conservative judges, so this is nothing new . . .\\n8. With the black robe and life tenure comes great independence. Yes, these conservative judges likely will remain ideologically conservative. But that does not mean they will side with a criminal president or a corrupt administration. I don’t want to sound cynical, but . . .\\n9. The judiciary likes to assert its authority over the executive branch. When both Nixon and Clinton made arguments that suggested a president is above (or beyond the reach of) the law/the judicial system, the Supreme Court shot them down.  Put another way . . .\\n10. The judiciary understand (and jealously guards) its authority and responsibility to remain a vitally important check on lawless behavior by the president and the executive branch.  These stonewalling tactics ultimately will fail, with the courts ruling against Trump. . .\\n11. and in favor of Congressional oversight and investigative authority. When given the opportunity, the courts WILL hold this criminal president accountable. It won’t happen quickly, though I believe the courts will move these matters through the system on an expedited basis...\\n12. Indeed, Judge Mehta articulated that these matters need to be given ‘most expeditious treatment when one branch of government is holding up the work of another’ (paraphrasing). Judge Mehta exemplified the fidelity to the law that inspires confidence in our judiciary . . .\\n13. Let’s be real, this battle between a lawless administration and a rule-of-law judiciary will continue for some time. Unfortunately, many of our elected officials in Congress have chosen to side with a lawless president. History will will not treat those politicians kindly...\\n14. So all of this is to say that it won’t come quickly, it won’t come easily, it won’t come painlessly, but Tuesday’s court hearing is an encouraging sign that #JusticeIsComing',\n",

The person\\'s motives and biases typically taints the narrative. Maybe it is time to just have only the data raw and unfiltered?\\nThe quantum problem in Africa is knowing what data to collect and where to get it from. Data collection in Africa is also expensive.

Maybe it is time for us to build our own African version of Palantir.\\nI believe that if we see African mega trends earlier at a macro level, we can solve local problems better.

       " 'One of the perverse realities of American politics since the Southern Strategy is how black voters, unions and groups like Planned Parenthood keep getting lumped into “the Establishment” or “the system” by certain parts of the left. /1\\nThe Southern Strategy moved a lot of white people, and especially white men, into the GOP. A direct result of all that white flight (which took decades) is that the Democratic Party, as an establishment, is disproportionately black- and woman-powered. Never more so than now. /2\\nAnd that influence is probably at its greatest and most visible in the primaries, when the base gets to vote amongst themselves.\\n\\nMeaning, in the primaries, reliable Democratic *voters* are a huge part of the Democratic “establishment”. /3\\nThis is probably a good time to point out that there’s no one The Establishment. There are a lot of establishments, with different amounts and types of power. /4\\nhttps://t.co/BOaniax1Mz\\nTrump is a great example. He spent most of his life outside the political establishment. But he’s always been a rich, bigoted, sexist white guy - the country’s oldest and most powerful establishment. /5\\nSo an “anti-establishment” Democrat could run against a lot of things. Like white male supremacy, or corporate deep pockets. At large, or even specifically within the Democratic Party. /6\\nAnd if they were sloppy, or racist, or sexist, an anti-establishment candidate could conflate the Corporate Deep Pockets Establishment with the Disproportionately Black and Female Voters Establishment. /7\\nA conflated “anti-establishment” message like that would resonate heavily with aggrieved white men on the left, and the women who love them. /8\\nIt could also resonate among left-wing voters that are ignorant of or disinterested in the voting power and preferences of black voters in Democratic primaries, and don’t see the conflation. /9\\nA primary candidate that lost due to black voters could even convince a lot of white people it was The Establishment’s fault. Because when it comes to the Democratic Party, black voters and “The Establishment” are intertwined in a way that’s ignored by a lot of white people. /10\\nAnd all of this is a recipe for leveling accusations of “you rigged the system against us” at the people who the system is actually rigged against. You have white men indirectly accusing women of color of voter suppression and election rigging. /11\\nThe most glaring example of this to me was in 2016, when some people accused the DNC of closing polling stations in Arizona to help Hillary. But the stations were actually closed by the GOP, and the Hispanic voters who were disproportionately affected leaned Hillary. /12\\nThese are all potential (inevitable?) pitfalls when populist language like “anti-establishment” gets aimed at the Democratic Party or other major left-wing groups. Not that they’re above reproach. But that conflation will be lurking as long as the left is less white and male. /13\\nAt the end of the day, this isn’t about any one candidate.

WAKE UP, MEDIA.\\n4/ Schiller\\'s story (a) doesn\\'t match the story of the Trump aide quoted by The Daily Caller, (b) doesn\\'t comport with his SOP from guarding Trump\\'s door in other {er} highly leveraged situations, and (c) *makes no sense whatsoever* coming from a bodyguard in a hostile situation.\\n5/ Now we learn, today, clear as day, without any fuzz on it, that the RNC and Trump campaign were giving out $15,000/month \"jobs\" as hush money to people with stories to tell. And bless Lara\\'s heart—she pretended that she\\'d just seen that $15,000/month figure for the first time.\\n6/ And this ISN\\'T a frivolous matter. The question at hand, which it seems we all know the answer to, is whether there\\'s a criminal conspiracy at the White House to commit a federal felony—witness tampering—to hide that the President of the United States is COMPROMISED by Russia.\\n7/ To be even clearer, the question of whether there is a criminal conspiracy to tamper with Schiller—a known federal witness in an investigation of the president\\'s (and others\\') actions—is AS SIGNIFICANT a question, given the testimony being tampered with, as ANY OTHER we have.\\n8/ I\\'m sure Schiller wants to be loyal; I\\'m sure he views discretion as part of his job; I\\'m sure he likes Trump.

Blackmail on POTUS is a national security issue.\\n9/ Having looked at this from the standpoint of a criminal investigator—work I used to do—I\\'ll now look at it from the standpoint of a criminal defense lawyer, which is also work I used to do: if Mueller can squeeze Schiller he\\'ll get FAR more than the events of November 8, 2013.\\n10/ Trump trusted Schiller so much that he brought him to *business dinners*, for instance the June 15, 2013 Las Vegas meeting—with 4 people later involved in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting—at which he decided to take $20 million from Agalarov to bring Miss Universe to Moscow.\\n11/ On the list of Trump-Russia witnesses who really know a *ton*, you have Flynn (nabbed), Gates (nabbed), Manafort (awaiting verdict), Cohen (possible cooperator), Sater (possible cooperator), (Erik) Prince and Schiller.

Any investigator or criminal lawyer sees that what Omarosa revealed today can LEAD TO critical breaks in the Trump-Russia investigation.\\n15/ Schiller has a rarified type of testimonial evidence that even major players in the Trump-Russia story (Flynn, Manafort, Gates and so on) *don\\'t*—Donald Trump\\'s daily, often secretive movements and schedules.

A link to the full transcript is at the end. It\\'s short, the entire court session only took 10 minutes.\\nThat POTUS was under investigation for obstruction of justice obviously isn\\'t new. But *exactly* WHEN that investigation started hasn\\'t been confirmed. This formerly secret \"proffer\" narrows it down to between May 9 (@Comey fired) and May 17 (Mueller appointed as SC) https://t.co/TMx4eRcbA9\\nMy belief is that the obstruction investigation paperwork on POTUS was opened by McCabe on May 10 or 11 2017. Why: because there was already an investigative file open at least before May 12 - which is when Comey gave his memos to the FBI, as covered here: https://t.co/RgZ3jAHe1o\\nDreeben confirms that Trump was a \"subject\" of the obstruction of justice investigation. That\\'s not new either, but it is curious. If you opened an obstruction case pretty solely based on Comey being fired *by Trump* who *else* could ever be the \"target\" of such an investigation? https://t.co/keIuHpQ4y9\\nMueller\\'s report pretty much admits that the entire obstruction investigation was actually into the president\\'s conduct, so it\\'s clear the word games here are to pretend Trump isn\\'t the target and they just want to get his side of the story. https://t.co/1mWJqMHuyI\\nExcept, according to Trump lawyer John Dowd (speaking to @ByronYork) - Mueller told him personally on March 5 2018 that the president was a \"witness-slash-subject\" with \"no exposure\" 🚨🤔 https://t.co/14Z1xJqe7h https://t.co/ZQr5UZvpsG\\nBut, just a few weeks before agreeing with Dowd that Trump had \"no exposure\", Dreeben made this secret proffer - on behalf of Mueller - just a few weeks earlier on Jan 22 2018...\\n...where a few things are now clear:\\na) Trump is *at minimum* a subject, not a mere witness\\nb) Trump\\'s really the *target*\\nc) Trump\\'s the only logical target of an investigation started into his conduct\\n\\nDid Mueller mislead Dowd? 🤔\\nRemember: Comey was the FBI Director &amp; he knew Trump had asked if he could possibly \"see his way clear\" to \"let go\" Flynn. Comey DID NOT open an obstruction investigation. So the only reason to open one after Comey is fired is: because Comey got fired. And his buddy McCabe did it\\nOh and if it turns out that McCabe opened that obstruction investigation on May 10 2017, then the later excuse that the FBI did it because of what Trump said to Lester Holt is a lie, because that interview wasn\\'t until May 11. Can someone ask Mueller this if he ever testifies? 🤔\\nIt\\'s also now obvious in retrospect that Rosenstein\\'s appointment order letter to Mueller made specific reference to regulation 20 CFR 600.4 to cover obstruction of justice since it would have been easier just to say all the regulations applied to the Special Counsel https://t.co/dofyEGxGCb\\nOh &amp; the reason the obstruction investigation starting almost immediately after Comey was fired isn\\'t *new* is because it was leaked to Collusion Media reporters at the Washington Post on June 14 2017.

This right here is the aggressive suppression of investigative journalism, a million times worse than some overpaid news anchor sobbing because Trump hurt his feelings. This right here is \"collusion\" of the worst kind. https://t.co/hkDQ9roKcq\\nBig Tech censorship is the malignant synthesis of campus deplatforming culture and U.S. tech companies working extensively with authoritarian regimes, especially China. They have grown enamored of China\\'s demonstration that information CAN be controlled, given enough power.\\nWe\\'re also in the final operational stages of a 15-year war launched by the Left after Rathergate and the rise of the bloggers. They were very determined to neutralize the subversive power of bloggers on the Right and their ability to slip information past the media gatekeepers.\\nThose bloggers were, at the time, confident their voices could not be stifled in the new information age. The Internet opened thousands of doors that could never be closed again. No one would ever be foolish enough to try another scam like Dan Rather\\'s.\\nBut China showed it COULD be done. The Internet isn\\'t really a limitless expanse of information that cannot be suppressed or policed for ideology. It has choke points - big platforms that can be controlled by either government censors or a few big companies working together.\\nYou don\\'t really have to impose complete silence and rigidly censor every single word to maintain ideological control. You just have to make dissidents shout through cupped hands while giant megaphones are handed to those who toe the ideological line.\\nRemember what happened in Rathergate, when a few intrepid bloggers with relatively limited followings broke a story that blew up into major media coverage? All the Left had to do was figure out how to arrest the \"blowing up\" process.\\nIf you broke a Rathergate story today, you would quickly find yourself removed from YouTube, banned from Facebook, demonetized, yanked off popular social platforms. Major media is HEAVILY influenced by social media today. That influence CAN be controlled, and so it is.\\nDissidents can\\'t be silenced completely, but they can be denied the kind of billion-watt blowtorch influence granted to the preferred left-wing orthodoxy. Speed is vital to the viral spread of information. Big Tech is slowing down the Right while giving the Left the express lane.\\nYour viral Rathergate story might eventually gain some traction after Big Tech stomped on it, but it would happen very slowly. Entire news cycles would pass. Polls could shift and elections could be held before the viral story broke into heavily policed information space.\\nBig Media understands all this. They demand rush treatment and snowballing news coverage for the stories that fit their politics. Reporters spend a lot of time on social media boosting Narrative-friendly stories or even inventing them by stitching a few tweets together.\\nIf the media politically approves of your story, it swings from one news hook to another like Spider-Man, never out of the top search results and top news aggregation sites. If it doesn\\'t approve, your story trundles along through the back alleys of information space.\\nSo the new censors can\\'t really shut you up entirely, but they CAN slow you down. They can quarantine your information from achieving viral penetration by forcing it to spread more slowly, while the stuff they like spreads with insane speed and few \"content rules\" to worry about.\\nReal journalists, people truly committed to the spirit of free inquiry, would be fighting this tooth and nail. They would understand the SPEED of information is vital. Governments and corporate cabals should not be allowed to slow it down to protect their interests.\\nBut instead, Big Media is primarily interested in re-establishing the guild privileges it lost so decisively in the time of Rathergate, concluding a process that began with the dissolution of Big Three network power. Censorship is their ally, not their mortal enemy. /end',\n",
       " 'The BOJ is poised to join the Fed &amp; ECB in easing monetary policy. The nature of the ease might surprise, as the BOJ has to overcome the self-imposed constraint of its Yield Curve Control regime, that monstrosity that biases policy to be pro-cyclical. 1/\\nThe background to an ease is fairly simple: inflation is nowhere near Kuroda’s goal of above 2% for a period of time, growth going in the wrong direction, and a likely recession inducing consumption tax hike is set to be enacted in October. 2/\\nThen there is the added concern of a strengthening JPY amid a more uncertain global economy and a weakening Japanese economy. (The JPY is pro-cyclical, tending to be weak when a strong economy boosts risk appetite and overseas capital outflows). 3/\\nThe case for an ease is compelling, but what form will it take? This is where the constraints of the YCC comes into play.  The madness of this policy is that it makes monetary policy pro-cyclical when by definition it is meant to be counter cyclical. 4/\\nFor example, when Japanese growth expectations are strong JGB yields are biased to the top-end of the BOJ’s target band forcing more QE. But when growth expectations dim, JGB yields rally to the point that the BOJ may need to taper/end QE. 5/\\nWe are not far from that point now with 10yr JGBs at -15.5bp, close to the lower-end of the +/- 20bp band. Expanding the monetary base via more JGB purchases without broader changes to the monetary framework is not an option. 6/ https://t.co/A184YCviAM\\nNor is the growing talk of a 20bp cut to the BOJ’s -0.1% policy rate credible as a stand-alone policy decision. This would steepen the curve, increase the slide on long JGB positions and hence bias JGBs even closer to the lower end of the policy band. 7/\\nThis means that the BOJ’s ease might have to be comprehensive. The path of least resistance is to increase ETF purchases. Talk of capacity constraints seems overdone as the mkt is doing what you would expect: it to - expanding supply to meet demand. 8/\\nThe BOJ owns 64.5% of Japanese equity ETFs and the growth of the market means it is a while before it will encounter binding capacity constraints. However, a broader monetary easing will entail broader changes to the yield curve. 9/\\nThe +/- 20bp volatility band for 10yr JGBs might need to be re-centered or, more optimally, widened, to allow for greater downside potential in yield before QE is forced to end. However, to support the banks the BOJ will want to keep the curve steep. 10/\\nHence, the policy rate could also be cut by 20-30bp. This broad policy package is not being talked about – which may simply reflect that it is fanciful.  However, it may be a logical path for the BOJ were they to want to inject greater policy stimulus. 11/\\nOf course, the observation above does not focus on what is optimal. The optimal path is to not raise the consumption tax. The 2014 hike derailed Abenomics just as it was gaining momentum. The current hike will hit an economy already losing momentum. 12/\\nWith around half of JGBs also an asset of the government via the BOJ and with the neural rate close to zero, it’s hard to be concerned with public debt. Combine this with collapsed inflation expectations &amp; Japan is a prime candidate for helicopter money. 13/\\nHowever, if the path of orthodoxy is followed there remains the potential for a surprising bold round of policy easing by the BOJ, probably in September but quite possibly in July. 14/ https://t.co/gJ2ioacoj6\\nAs an aside, the inverted world of YCC that creates pro-cyclical monetary policy explains my shock to read the Fed recently praising Japan’s experiment. They were probably just being polite, but then again they also felt the neutral FF rate was 3.0%... 15/',\n",

I considered myself a classical liberal /1\\nThe right talks of \"red pill moments,\" in which a person of the left is mugged by reality and becomes rightwing.

I went through a paradigm shift starting 5 years ago. /2\\nTeaching at @WabashCollege in Indiana, I spent some time with the students and faculty of the Malcolm X Institute for Black Studies. Learning (and seeing) the experiences of these students in small-town Indiana changed me. /3\\nComing from Canada and then Ithaca, NY, it was easy for me to overlook and ignore the oppression other groups faced (though it was still there). But in Indiana, these students were regularly pulled over by cops (I never was), tailed by staff at stores (I never was). /4\\nThey also faced far more blatant acts of racism, like shouts of \"white power\" from passing cars, etc. There is simply no denying that African Americans face this kind of thing day after day after day. That I don\\'t is just the very tip of my white privilege. /5\\nI began to see the world and myself differently. I saw that I am extraordinarily privileged, that though I do work hard I am starting way ahead of others by being white, upper-middle class, with educated parents, etc. I\\'m not where I am just because of what I\\'ve done. /6\\nSince meeting the students of @WabashCollege and the MXI, I simply can\\'t be a \"classical liberal\" any more. There simply isn\\'t a level playing field, not in terms of race, educational opportunities, economic resources, etc. To act like there is is cruel and self-serving. /7\\nMany things have also happened since to change my view of the world (reading Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas, for one...), but in general I now err on the side of not presuming my experience is like others\\' experiences. I try to default to compassion and self-awareness. /8\\nTo end the confession, perhaps too honestly: Only 5 years ago I might have said \"all lives matter\"; \"not all men\"; \"everything is up for debate\"; \"I\\'m a free speech absolutist\"; \"students need to be prepared for the real world\". /9\\nNow I say \"black lives matter\"; \"I believe women\"; \"I don\\'t get to debate the existence of others\"; \"free speech absolutism benefits the already powerful\"; \"marginalised students have already seen more of the real world than I ever will\".

       " 'A couple of reflections on @mattwridley opinion piece in today’s @thetimes – particularly given he points out (and rejects) @nfutweets view that a no-deal, or WTO default Brexit, could lead to damaging delays at the border. 1/\\n\\nhttps://t.co/cvqfU2VdRc\\nIndeed we do believe no deal could be very damaging in terms of border delays. But I accept that there is a debate to be had whether or not there would, in reality, be calamitous blockages at the border in a no-deal scenario. 2/\\nThere is an argument that (put crudely), under WTO rules the EU cannot erect unreasonable barriers and border checks to UK goods on SPS/TBT grounds (e.g safeguards on plant, animal and human health). 3/\\nTo do so, the argument goes, would be discriminatory when the EU knows our goods would still be compliant. How could there possibly have been time for any divergence in standards in the days immediately following Brexit that would justify such checks? 4/\\nThis is a fair point, as far as it goes. However, this “smooth border” WTO default scenario makes some assumptions that I think undermine completely Ridley\\'s argument... 5/\\nFirstly, it gives WTO rules a force and supremacy that simply doesn’t exist in practice. The EU (and by extension the UK) have behaved on a number of fronts in breach of WTO rules for many years (e.g. chlorinated chicken). 6/\\nThere is no magic WTO policeman who comes knocking, even if a breach of rules was clear (which it isn’t in this case – see @GeorgePeretzQC for more https://t.co/8NNaCjEvJb). Basically, how much can we rely on \"WTO rules\" as a restriction on EU behaviour. Not much... 7/\\nJust saying the EU isn’t allowed to erect checks at the border on day one of Brexit doesn’t mean they won’t. 8/\\nSecondly, it says nothing of EU tariff collection on our exports to the EU (indeed the Ridley piece explicitly skirts around it). This (and VAT) will cause delays at the border on exports, not to say adding big costs to sectors such as lamb which rely heavily on EU markets. 9/\\nWhat of avoiding delays on imports by unilaterally eliminating checks? Well, this would mean (a) reducing/eliminating tariffs across the board to all importers (not just EU) with obvious implications for British farming. 10/\\n(On which point, was the post-Brexit vision set out at the referendum one which involved the decimation of our British rural economies?!) 11/\\n…and (b) we would need to reduce or even just scrap safety checks on food coming into the UK. I don’t even know where to go with that as a bad idea…. 12/\\nHowever, we might reasonably ask whether, in reality, the EU would erect unnecessary barriers at the border with the mayhem that would follow if it doesn’t have to…? 13/\\n@hhesterm makes a very good point here on this: https://t.co/JCF4uvjWPM … – what will the customs officer on the ground do? Are we really confident that he or she doesn’t take the safe option and follow the letter of the law and treat the UK as a 3rd country like any other… 14/\\nPerhaps they will see sense.

       " 'I agree @ItaButtrose that sometimes ABC reporters ‘unconsciously let their biases show through’ - but this isn’t left wing bias. According to my quantitative research it’s right wing bias framing news using capitalist class’s view of economy, capital versus labour. A thread👇🏻\\nArticle for reference here, where Ita is laying groundwork to bring more conservative voices into the ABC. In other words - doing what Murdoch/Liberals have been lobbying for FOR YEARS:\\nhttps://t.co/9BBjKDvtZ7\\nI looked at reporting of an industrial dispute - CFA versus UFU in Vic 2016. These results are obvs just one case, but I also looked at five historical disputes and they are generalisable across normal industrial disputes between workers and employer.\\nHere is a breakdown of media reporting by percentage of narrative. Red matches union/Labor narrative, blue matches employer/Liberal narrative. Yes I counted them - this represents thousands of codes. https://t.co/JjdJ2YIwMd\\nAs you can see, ABC isn’t the most biased in aligning its narrative with the employer, but it is certainly not biased towards left. The right wing narrative which dominated media framed the union and firefighter members as unreasonable, thuggish, greedy and trying to grab power.\\nI found this employer/Liberal narrative was so close to the Herald Sun/Australian narrative that it was hard to tell where it was born - seamless in its similarity and consistent across both groups.\\nHowever, I also found this same narrative evident in ABC and Guardian reporting - not biased to the same extent, but it certainly dominated both these outlets and the union/Labor narrative was used far less often (given far less credibility).\\nThe reason I used an industrial dispute as a case study is that it provides a generalisable case study to understand framing of political and economic news more broadly. The relationship between workers and capital is the basis of left wing versus right wing politics.\\nYou can see similar bias that I found in ABC industrial dispute reporting across much ABC political coverage. It is likely unconscious as Ita so helpfully points out. But it’s there - and it does change the way Australia understands politics.\\nA great example is way ABC reporters mostly write/talk about tax through a negative frame. Framing expert George Lakoff describes the success neoliberal/conservative politicians have had in using the phrase ‘tax relief’ to frame tax as something you are afflicted by - a negative.\\nHere is an article from ABC doing exactly this - framing tax cuts as a ‘relief’ - this is a right wing idea. Yes, this has become a dominant frame, but that nevertheless has a right wing bias. The capital class sees tax as a bad thing, and fight tooth and nail against paying it. https://t.co/NOVG6H1Epr\\nIf ABC really did have left wing bias as Ita suggests, tax would be framed as a positive thing. Tax is redistributive. Tax creates government services and spending to benefit the whole society. This is a left wing idea - that tax is positive. Framing it as negative is right wing.\\nSo successful have the neoliberals been at framing policies they don’t like as bad for the economy, and perpetuating a myth that left wing governments can’t manage money, these ideas have become rules of thumb, otherwise known as right wing biases.\\nThe biases towards the interests of the capital class are subtle, yet important. For instance, interviewing someone losing from franking credits changes, without also interviewing someone gaining from a policy funded by this change is not a balanced report.\\nI have found there is a structural bias across all media - sometimes subtle, sometimes overt - which benefits the views and interests of the capital class over the rest of society. The ABC exhibits such right wing bias. Not all the time. Not every report. But it’s there. End.',\n",

Which doesn\\'t imply that Stone (not part of the campaign) didn\\'t coordinate with anonymous agents of the IRA, or with Assange (not American.)\\nBarr says Mueller supplies evidence of obstruction, then uses the fact that he doesn\\'t establish conspiracy to a certain legal standard (which doesn\\'t at all rule it out, in fact) to argue in a shady way that there was nothing to obstruct, so he let\\'s Trump off scot-free.\\nThe Trump admin/campaign then uses it\\'s own opportunistic judgment as a fixed fact to leverage an attack on the legitimacy of Dem oversight officials in Congress. But Congress\\'s constitutional oversight authority is wholly independent of the executive\\'s findings about itself.\\nTrump has gone to pains to confuse people into accepting that the legitimacy of congressional oversight depends on a prior, narrow legal finding of criminality, which it has done everything it can to prevent. Having done it successfully, it\\'s attacking the separation of powers.\\nBut congressional power over the executive under the constitution is entirely political.

It implicates  entire conservative media bubble - including Hannity, Tucker, Breitbart, and  rest of @FoxNews - as participants/dupes  in a fraud directed by people in Stone-Individual 1-Wikileaks conspiracy..\\n@FoxNews 2...allegations. This, however, comes directly from an email, so I think it can be deemed fact. One of the most bizarre things in the entire election was the relentless build-up on Fox and other organizations about Hillary being infirm and sick. This started long BEFORE she....\\n@FoxNews 3...came down with pneumonia. She was accused - on  basis of nothing - of being infirm, weak, old, with Parkinsons, with epilepsy, etc etc. It always struck me as the ultimate proof that the conservative media bubble conspires in agreed-upon frauds, since her medical records...\\n@FoxNews 4...were public, and showed nothing. Hannity actually found some hack doctor to come on the air and diagnose Hillary with epilepsy on the basis that she had a goofy head movement once that was obviously her being humorous. Real neurologists - I know a lot of them - were....\\n@FoxNews 5...flabbergasted that someone claiming to be a doctor would say these things that were demonstrably false. But Hannity and all the rest of the conservative liars went with it. It was soon after it expanded to Parkinson\\'s and later Multiple Sclerosis. Again all on the basis...\\n@FoxNews 6...of nothing. When she had her issue with Pneumonia, and had a doctors record release to prove it, Tucker said on the air, \"Well, I don\\'t believe it. I think it\\'s something else.\" This was reckless but it always amazed me that they were all on message, all together, no limits..\\n@FoxNews 7...to how insane they would get in trying to proclaim Hillary on death\\'s door.\\n\\nUntil today. Now I get it. It was part of the Stone/Wikileaks conspiracy described in the indictment. Watch your emails, Hannity and Tucker. You might want to see if you are implicated....\\n@FoxNews 8...here is the relevant info. Stone was publicly claiming to be in contact with Assange by early August 2016. Lots of emails/text message were swapped around about this. (What idiots these guys are.) A guy deemed Person 1 was a political commentator with an online publication...\\n@FoxNews 9...Person 1 was in contact with Stone regarding Wikileaks releases. Stone sent an email to Person 1 asking him to get someone to Assange in Ecuadorian Embassy in London to pick up emails. Person 1 then sent that message to a Trump supporter from London. (While I am not saying...\\n@FoxNews 10..I know anything as to who it is, I only know of two prominent Trump supporters in London who would be in contact with online political commentator in US - and both of them are jaw dropping if they are involved.) After that, Person 1 reports that Assange is going to do....\\n@FoxNews 11..two more document dumps. In that same email, Person 1 says what the hackers are planning, and then adds the key phrase \"Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke – neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus...\" https://t.co/s9wa9nwJFB\\n@FoxNews 12...almost IMMEDIATELY after that email, Hannity jumps into the water, proclaiming that Hillary is not well.

As another witness @CaslerNoel discusses Trump\\'s use of amphetamines (this one I didn\\'t know about), it\\'s time to remind folk of my reporting bout Trump\\'s medical records that show he was addicted to an amphetamine derivative for at least eight years...https://t.co/ApMLRLtAwV\\n2...in Trump\\'s pre-election medical statement (which his doctor, Harold Bornstein, now says Trump wrote himself), he reports Bornstein had been his doctor since 1980. What Trump hid, as I previously reported, is he had a second doctor from 1982-1990 named Dr. Joseph Greenberg...\\n3...Greenberg was widely known years later (particularly when 60 Minutes reported it in the 1990s) as a guy who prescribed uppers to famous people. The records show that Trump was one of his patients starting in 1982. The records show....\\n4...that Greenberg diagnosed Trump with a \"metabolic imbalance\" which somehow disappeared from his pre-election medical report. “Metabolic imbalance” is a catch-all phrase for different conditions and, in itself, is equivalent of a diagnosis of “heart problem.” There are....\\n5...electrolyte insufficiencies, anaerobic imbalances, acid imbalances, and an assortment of related disorders that can have serious health consequences. According to a 2007 peer-reviewed study, patients with underlying mental illnesses have a higher incidence of this syndrome...\\n6...the medical records reveal that Greenberg gave Trump a prescription for amphetamine derivatives in 1982 to treat his \"metabolic problem;\" the records show that Trump continued taking the drugs for a number of years and the former officials said that Trump stopped using...\\n7...on or about 1990. Now, before Trumpers start screaming \"fake news\" - Trump White House (Hope Hicks) admitted Trump used these when I asked, but lied to say it was only for a few weeks. I asked \"how do you know that, since the medical records show it is for many years?\"....\\n8...Hope never got back to me with an answer. So...let\\'s talk about what the records show. The derivatives were diethylpropion, known under its brand name as tenuate dospan. These drugs are designed for short-term use; studies have concluded that patients can...\\n9...only avoid developing a dependence on the drug if they take it for 25 weeks or less. But Trump continued downing the pills for years. According to two people – someone who said Trump would consider him a friend and a former Trump executive – the then-real estate developer...\\n10...boasted that the diethylpropion gave him enormous energy and helped him concentrate. A former Trump executive claimed to have picked up the medication while running errands for the boss. This person said the prescription, for 75 milligrams of diethylpropion a day, was....\\n11...filled at least for a time at a Duane Reade drugstore on 57th Street in Manhattan, a few blocks from Trump Tower. The executive said, like many celebrities, Trump used an alias for the prescription. Diethylpropion has a high risk of dependency and chronic abuse – such as...\\n12. ...taking it for years – can cause delusions, paranoia, and hyperactivity. Studies in medical journals also report it can result in sleeplessness and impulse control problems. Trump stopped the diethylpropion completely in 1990 under the supervision of a doctor, a former...\\n13...executive with his company said (ending the drug after long-term use causes serious withdrawal problems.) Until now, with the statements by the fellow who formerly worked with Trump, there had never been evidence that Trump began using such uppers again. Which is why....\\n14...@CaslerNoel statements about his watching Trump snort crushed up adder all is so important. Think of the probabilities here: Records show Trump used uppers from 1982-1990, then Casler says Trump was using them during his time working on the Apprentice. I don\\'t know Casler...\\n15...I don\\'t think he knows me. Isn\\'t it interesting that my reporting - and Casler\\'s statements about his personal experience - align so perfectly? \\n\\nDone.',\n",

A 14yo girl called Jacqueline falls in love with a 17yo boy called John, who was from the “wrong part of town.” Read: Poor.\\nJacqueline’s parents did everything they could think of to keep them apart but it was no use. They proper loved each other. \\n\\nJacqueline’s mother really hated John. She told Jacqueline he’d “get her pregnant &amp; leave her because that’s what his common sort did”\\n\\nShe was wrong.\\nAfter 4yrs they were still together so Jacqueline’s parents took drastic measures. Her Dad had spent much of his working life as an electrician in Africa, so they decided to return, taking Jacqueline with them. \\n\\nShe didn’t want to go. She had a job as a librarian &amp; she had John.\\n1 month, they promised her. Just 1 month and then she could come home. They promised that they’d already bought her return plane ticket. \\n\\nSo she said goodbye to John. \\nAnd she went with them to Kaduna, in Nigeria.\\nWhen the month was up, Jacqueline went to her mother &amp; asked for her ticket home. \\n\\n“What ticket?” Her mother feigned ignorance. “Jacqueline...you should have known that you’d never win with me. You’re staying here with us.” \\n\\nThey took her passport and Jacqueline was trapped.\\nThat night Jacqueline’s parents took her to a gala dinner for ex-pats.

And yet, he seemed...good, somehow. \\n\\nShe took a chance, and went to the room as he’d asked her to...\\nTurned out he was a very wealthy businessman who owned an airline. He told her to be ready outside her house at dawn in a few days time. A car would be waiting to drive her to Kano. \\n\\nHe then handed her a plane ticket to England. \\n\\nOverwhelmed, Jacqueline swore to pay him back.\\nJacqueline sneaked into her parent’s room &amp; stole back her passport. With trepidation she left with the businessman’s driver for Kano; a journey of nearly 4hrs over bushland and wilderness. \\n\\nShe was just 18. \\n\\nKano-Brussels-Madrid-London-Manchester...where John was waiting.\\nThis is the telegram she sent before she left Kaduna: https://t.co/yPGlTPkirR\\n48 years later, they’re still together. \\n\\nSometimes, you just know when it’s right.

       " 'THREAD: What does today\\'s news that Flynn is pleading guilty to making a false statement to the FBI mean?\\n1/ Today Special Counsel Robert Mueller will charge Flynn with making a false statement to the FBI. This is almost certainly a signal that Flynn has a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller. Read the charge here: https://t.co/fpFBqwhI6S\\n2/ We have heard reports that Flynn was under investigation for a wide variety of crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent.\\n3/ If Flynn didn\\'t cooperate, he could have been charged with other crimes, such as failure to register. For instance, Manafort was charged with a wide variety of crimes. Flynn\\'s indictment could have looked like that.\\n4/ This charging document is called an \"information,\" which is the same kind of charging document that Papadopoulos had. All that means is that the defense agreed that Mueller didn\\'t have to present the document to a grand jury for approval.\\n5/ The main benefit that Flynn appears to be receiving in this plea deal is that he is pleading guilty to one count of making a false statement to the FBI instead of pleading guilty to other crimes. The false statement charge carries a five-year maximum sentence.\\n6/ That means that no matter how bad the judge thinks Flynn is, or what sentence the judge would like to impose, he is \"capped\" at a five-year maximum sentence. That could be a very significant benefit to Flynn.\\n7/ This doesn\\'t mean that the judge won\\'t consider other things that Flynn did. In fact, the judge is required to consider all of the \"history and characteristics\" of Flynn, which includes other wrongdoing by him.\\n8/ But this plea could significantly affect the recommended advisory sentence under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. While the guidelines will factor in criminal conduct beyond the false statements it will only consider crimes that are part of the same \"course of conduct.\"\\n9/ Flynn\\'s lobbying work, for example, may not be part of the same course of conduct as the false statements. So this could result in a lower recommended Guidelines sentence, which could influence the sentence imposed by the judge.\\n10/ Flynn could still be charged with other crimes, either by Mueller or by a state Attorney General like Eric Schneiderman. That is a hammer that Mueller has over Flynn, if he does not truthfully testify and fully cooperate.\\n11/ That said, if Flynn cooperates, I don\\'t expect that he will be charged with other crimes. That means that he\\'s received a substantial benefit from Mueller, and suggests that Flynn can provide \"substantial assistance\" to Mueller.\\n12/ \"Substantial assistance\" means that Flynn can help Mueller make a case against someone else that Mueller thinks is worth charging. Generally defendants don\\'t get as much credit for \"cooperating down\" or cooperating against equals.\\n13/ That doesn\\'t tell us who Flynn is cooperating against. It\\'s possible that Flynn is cooperating against associates as well as Manafort and Gates, and Mueller thinks that\\'s sufficient. But there\\'s a reasonable chance that it\\'s someone bigger than that.\\n14/ None of this tells us what will happen with Flynn\\'s son, Michael Flynn Jr. I suspect that not charging Flynn Jr. might be part of the deal, but that would also be a very substantial benefit and would suggest greater cooperation by Flynn.\\n15/ Flynn won\\'t be sentenced until *after* all of his cooperation is complete, so the judge can consider his cooperation and factor that into the sentence. So we won\\'t know for quite a while, maybe years (if Manafort goes to trial), what his sentence will be. /end',\n",

In this song, he wishes he never saw 'the blackness of his/her eyes.'  https://t.co/qaPBAA03T1\\nMore Boumeddienne. This song is very popular with the older generation in Benghazi. It's all about old places, memories, lost people. I grew up hearing my father sing it: https://t.co/zAP19C0VlC\\nThis is Nouri Kamal, from Tripoli. This song is called 'Zahrat il-Yasmeen' or 'Jasmine Flower.' So so beautiful: https://t.co/bbddoryhJB\\nThis is Mohammed Sadeg (I think) also from Tripoli/ the West. This song is called 'habiba' or beloved. One of my mum's favourite:  https://t.co/MKA66LCatn\\nNow the classical Libyan music scene is very male dominated. But there are a few amazing and well loved women too and without doubt Tunis Muftah, from Al-Bayda in East Libya, is of of the most popular. Here is her song 'Ma Tagyeb' or don't leave:https://t.co/BQ62Pywwyz\\nThis is Fatima Ahmed, from (I think) Benghazi, singing 'Izz Elrafagha' or the dearest of companions. Another song I grew up hearing my mum sing: https://t.co/eOkSUZzlW1\\nThis is Salmeen Zarrough, another famous woman singer from Eastern Libya (I think), singing 'A'hadtni tsoun al-mahaba' or your promised to safeguard our love: https://t.co/rqB0ShI5RU\\nThis is Saif Al-Nasr, I am not sure where in Libya he's from but he is relatively modern. This is one of his most poignant songs 'Ayni Bakat' or my eye cried: https://t.co/BZW72uhkjS\\nThis is Adel Abdul-Majid, from Benghazi. He was my grandma's neighbour! This is my favourite song ever, 'Haz ElShog' or my longing shook: https://t.co/bFtKVu2o3V\\nThis is Abdul-Latif El-Hewel, from Tripoli. This song is called 'Al-Wafa ya Ridi' or loyalty, my intended: https://t.co/fz9hBLv0jP\\nThis is Ali Sha'lia, not sure where in Libya he's from. This song is really popular and is called 'Noor Ayoun' or light of eyes: https://t.co/0VZmHjASA2\\nThis is Mohammed Kabazi, from Tripoli, signing 'Allah Ysamkhek ya Azeez Aliya' or God forgive you dearest one. I really like this one: https://t.co/nnOF84rBzC\\nThis is Mustafa Talib from (I think) Tripoli/ Western Libya. Here he is signing a folkloric song from Fezzan, South of Libya, Fi Moula El-Khodod  https://t.co/MS2HPzjZyM\\nThat's it for now because I can go on and on lol! I might add with time some more songs but I think for now this is enough!\\nAlthough I grew up hearing my parents sing some of these songs, I never heard them in the original. I only came to them in my early 20s. I researched them, asked my parents to help me find them. I feel so connected to (an idea of?) Libya through them, of its culture, beauty\",\n",

I withheld comment on impeachment out of deference to Mueller’s work and his professionalism. But now we have the report, and it’s shocking.\\nMueller found a ton of corruption: 34 guilty pleas or indictments of individuals and companies. Five of Trump’s highest-level associates pleaded guilty to serious felonies, including his campaign chairman, personal lawyer, and national security advisor.\\nThe Trump campaign was willing and eager to work with a foreign adversary to interfere in our elections. This is far more significant wrongdoing even than the Watergate break-in and its subsequent cover-up which led to Nixon’s impeachment and resignation.\\nThe report also details 10 instances of obstruction of justice by the president, while in office. Over 1,000 former federal prosecutors from both political parties said this evidence is enough to support prosecution and conviction on felony obstruction of justice charges. https://t.co/lWYmYwgllE\\nMueller himself said he did NOT exonerate the president. He felt he could not prosecute Trump because of a DOJ rule against indicting a sitting president. He made it clear it\\'s up to Congress to take further action. Given the record presented, we are duty-bound to proceed.\\nThe Constitution provides that the president “shall be removed from Office, on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Nobody disputes that felony obstruction of justice is a “high crime” under the Constitution.\\nImpeachment is not a redo of the election. Voters accepted a lot that I found appalling: mocking the disabled, childish name calling, attacking war heroes and Gold Star families, insulting Muslims and Mexicans. But while this behavior is abhorrent, it is for voters to judge.\\nWe’ve seen terrible policies from Trump: dangerous foreign policy, tariffs that hurt Americans, reckless tax cuts, cruelty toward asylum-seekers, and attempts to rip health care from millions. I disagree with Trump\\'s policies, but they\\'re for elections, not impeachment.\\nImpeachment is not about the president’s character or policies. It’s about upholding the rule of law and defending the Constitution. It’s about whether he has broken the law. The Mueller Report contains plenty of evidence that he did. Hearings may produce more such evidence.\\nSome argue impeachment poses a political risk for Democrats. They say Republicans will claim Trump was vindicated regardless of the outcome. That gives Americans too little credit. I trust them to discern which of us did our patriotic duty and who played to political cynicism.\\nWe should never pursue impeachment for political reasons. Nor should we avoid it for political reasons. It’s Congress’ job to determine whether the president broke the law and acted against the interests of the United States.\\nIf we don’t act, we send the message that criminal behavior is normal for presidents. Trump will be more emboldened to ignore Congress. And we will increase cynicism among those who depend on us to uphold the law and the Constitution. None of that is acceptable.\\n@justinamash is right: “The risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ [impeachment] as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct...\" https://t.co/PkhS2aiBTM\\n@justinamash \"Our system of checks and balances relies on each branch jealously guarding its powers and upholding its duties under our Constitution. When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution, the Rule of Law–the foundation of liberty–crumbles.”\\n@justinamash Democrats are leading on the problems facing Americans: health care, ethics in government, comprehensive immigration reform and border security, gun safety, and civil rights. We must continue to pass groundbreaking legislation, as we have, and as we were elected to do.\\n@justinamash And now we are assigned another solemn task by the Constitution and by current events. We need to begin impeachment hearings.',\n",
       " '\"Global warming\" can make winter colder.\\n\\nJet streams are a fascinating piece of the climate science puzzle that most people have never considered. Learning about this one simple thing for 5 min explains SO MUCH.\\n\\nWhen everyone knows this we will all accomplish more.\\n\\nTHREAD https://t.co/vwl04KJ5sX\\n1. First point:\\n\\n\"Weather\" (clouds, storms, rain ect.) is pushed around by wind.\\n\\nThere are some major, reliable, high altitude winds like the jet steams that push weather around the Earth in predictable patterns. https://t.co/AIKBs4mVXy\\n2. Here\\'s how jet streams work:\\nThe sun warms the air around the equator all year. The warm air then moves up and towards the poles. The air coming off the poles towards the equator is freezing cold. Where the warm air and cold air collide the jet stream is formed. https://t.co/F4AAYR5RJN\\n3. The jet stream is like a fast moving (about 275 mph) river of air that goes from West to East (due to the Earth\\'s spin.) When a strong steady flow of hot air hits a strong flow of cold air the jet stream is formed in a fairly straight line. https://t.co/HT2M5wm112\\n4. The temperature doesnt stay the same all of the time. The Earth\\'s position changes during the year causing the sun to warm it differently. It also spins so is cooler at night etc. So a normal jet stream tends to look like this and shifts predictably with seasons. https://t.co/pzlWxzFOFZ\\n5. These high atmosphere winds bring us much of our weather, &amp; because they are so reliable in the way they move &amp; change from winter to summer they bring us mostly predictable seasonal weather. So predictable, in fact, that our ecosystems have developed in response to them. https://t.co/A7IjbgqF9P\\n6. Global warming is causing warming at the poles. (Among other things.) When the air at the poles is warmer then the interaction between warm and cold air isnt as forceful  which causes the jet stream to slow and meander like a slow river on an open plain looking more like this. https://t.co/K1vYFNm51X\\n7. This brings much colder air further south causing winter cold and storms in the US that previously were kept in Canada, while the Arctic has warmer than average temperatures. It also causes changes in rain and snow patterns. https://t.co/VkKGAqbkGZ\\n8. The current cold spell includes a related phenomenon. Scientists believe a meandering current of air cut through the polar vortex this year causing it to split in two with one segment getting pushed south to hover and swirl over the US, waiting for spring to dissipate it. https://t.co/zawicWYQ4R\\n9. Another rarely mentioned result  of predictable air currents is that when the strong current of air like a jet stream encounters a storm at high altitudes it dissipates the swirling force, keeping storms small.\\n\\nWeaker jet streams = bigger storms.\\nhttps://t.co/8P4jm6vg9s\\n10. Climate science is complex with lots of moving parts, many of them happening out of sight high above the Earth.\\nEverything we can say about it is over simplified and sometimes not yet known. \\n\\nThis makes it easy to ignore or deny. https://t.co/6s1gEvBauU\\n11. Beyond that anyone profiting off (or using) coal, oil, plastic etc. has a vested interest in ignoring (or even suppressing) the understanding of climate change. We all love our cars plastics, heat, convenience... https://t.co/CfKWQPgnCU\\n12.The warmer the Arctic gets the more the jet stream will shift and meander.\\nOur winters will get colder, summers drier, storms bigger. Weather patterns will change killing eco systems.\\nThis is why sharing info on climate change is absolutely vital today.\\n/end https://t.co/UuLbUAyI9Y\\nSome additional links to read more:\\nhttps://t.co/m9X2wetyFW\\nOne way the jet stream can move the polar vortex\\nhttps://t.co/CdDhTGdMz1\\nMore on the vortex\\n\"...can cause kinks in the jet stream so that, instead of flowing west to east, there are a lot of dips and ridges.

The facts of the case and timeline are most fascinating.\\n2. Strzok\\'s dismissal was revealed less than a day after Gen. Flynn pleaded guilty. Remember that. Less than 24 hours later. However the dismissal occurred over the summer. I\\'ll repeat: he was dismissed over the summer, we hear about it a day after Flynn pleads guilty.\\n3. Strzok was texting pro-Hillary text messages with Lawyer Lisa Page who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Page and Strrzok were having an extramarital affair. The two pro Hillary lovebirds exchanged texts during both Hillary server and Russia- Trump investigation\\n4. Strzok was subsequently demoted to a job in human resources, Page left Mueller’s team in July, BEFORE the text messages surfaced. Again note the timeline. \\nhttps://t.co/S0S7EFR3J1\\n5. Strozk was a part of FBI\\'s interview with Hillary on July 2, 2016 FEW days before Comey announced he was declining to recommend Hillary\\'s prosecution in connection with her use, as secretary of state, of a private email server. https://t.co/jigfpZSUEe\\n6. Strzok was key figure when FBI, in 2016, received Trump \"dossier\" and launched a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the election that ultimately came to encompass FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.\\n7. Strzok briefed house intelligence committee on Dec. 5, 2016, within months of that session HIC investigators were contacted by an informant suggesting that there was “documentary evidence” that Strzok was purportedly obstructing the House probe into the dossier.\\n8. HIC Chairman Devin Nunes asked Rod Rosenstein in Oct 2017 who oversees the Trump-Russia probe since Jeff Sessions\\' recusal, to make Strzok available to committee for questioning. This was denied: on broad \"personnel\" grounds.\\n9. While Strzok’s removal from the Mueller team was a matter of public record by August, at no point did we know about his Pro-Hillary texts and overall stance. This was revealed by \"sources\" only a day after Gen Flynn\\'s plea.\\n10. Think about the fact that Jeff Sessions\\' recusal put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein next in line to be asked directly for facts pertaining to Strzok and his involvement in Hillary\\'s server as well as the Trump dossier. Coincidence?\\n11. How about the timing of Strzok\\'s extramarital texts to Lisa page? Who leaked that information? Why was information leaked strategically right after Gen. Flynn\\'s guilty plea. I doubt there are any coincidences in what is going on right now.\\n12. Strzok is the key that opens a Pandora\\'s box of treasonous activity designed to get Hillary elected, bury her illegal activities and subjugate the will of the American people.\\n13. Remember Trump\\'s \"You\\'re going to be in jail\" comment to Hillary during the debate, followed by his own asking of her to be \"left alone. Then Jeff Sessions recused himself. All made little sense when it happened.\\n14. Trump does very little without knowing way in advance what it\\'s going to result in. He then confuses the hell out of the media by his obtuse tweets that are designed to discombobulate and stun idiots of all manners. Every now and then he tweets facts. \\nhttps://t.co/frpwkyIZ59\\n15. By then the media is so behind figuring out exactly what\\'s happening, it is all too late. He is playing 3D chess with Mr. Magoo-like MSM. Here is another one of ABC\\'s Magoo\\'s. Meanwhile, I\\'m drinking delicious tea and rubbing my hand in glee!\\n-Cheers\\nhttps://t.co/YzDpvT2YyE\\nAnother example of Trumps ability to completely stun and discombobulate the media. https://t.co/h6ghRTdGAt',\n",

The government is the referee in society. The government\\'s main job is to protect the weak from the strong, the unarmed from the armed, owners from thieves, eaters and drinkers from poisoners.\\n3. Many of the most profitable industries today are only profitable because the owners can take the profits, and poison the air and water.\\nThey can sell the throwaway plastic containers and externalize the cleanup costs.\\nThey can rig the financial system to cheat most people.\\n4. They can inject poisons into the only Earth we have, and sell the fossil fuels that are squeezed out in the process.\\nThey can build fences and, yes, walls, around the most desirable property, and exclude all but their rich peers from access.\\n6. They can buy up industry after industry, company after company, until it is only they and their friends who are bidding for employees.\\nThen they can make sure nobody bids a living wage.\\nMonopoly does not hurt only consumers. It is death on producers.\\n7. When your income stream is derived from destroying the planet, the atmosphere, the biosphere, society and any shred or memory of fairness, it behooves you to see to it that there is no referee.\\nThe government *was* the referee.\\n8. I hope you don\\'t believe that the month-long shutdown was about a wall.\\nIt was not about a wall.\\nThe month-long shutdown permanently weakened \"the administrative state.\" It gave organized crime, which literally does include so-called legitimate industry, a huge head start.\\n9.

Why do you think that\\n(A) The Republicoup tells you government is your enemy, and\\n(B) All the big money supports the Republicoup\\n?\\n11. Do you know why they could pull off the longest shutdown in history?\\nBecause they have spent 39 years convincing the not-very-smart and the I-love-the-poorly-educated that government is their enemy.\\nSo sure, shut it down. It ain\\'t no good to me.\\n12. And we played right into their hands. We usually do.\\nWe talked about the \"800,000 people not getting paid.\"\\nAnd they said, \"Fuck them. They work for the government. They\\'re a bunch of free-loaders who don\\'t do anything for anybody.\"\\n13. We have a giant uphill battle on our hands, should we choose to engage it.\\nWe have to sell the concept that government is good, to a huge voting public who is *positive* that government is their worst enemy.\\n14. Money now owns our elections. Surely anyone who has eyes can see that the people who can afford to fund our electoral system isn\\'t going to allow anyone to participate who might clip their wings.\\nOur Constitution has been hacked and rewritten, and we\\'ve let them claim it.\\n15. I\\'m going to re-up my pinned thread here, to explain what I mean.\\nBut the point is, screaming in outrage when they seat a Bret Kavanaugh isn\\'t going to help.\\nEver been to a fire safety class?\\n16. If you want to put out a fire, you aim your extinguisher at the base of the flames.\\nWhatever lie Trumpov told yesterday, I can assure you it wasn\\'t the base of the flames.\\nQuit helping them hide. Quit falling for the act.\\n17. It\\'s not just Trumpov. He\\'s a pissant, a small time mobster. He\\'s just there to piss you off.

And the host did sing with one voice, ‘ungodly woman, thou foolest us not.  We know the true reason thou despisest Saint Jeremy.’ 1\\nAnd she did say unto them ‘share thy hot take.’ And with righteous wrath they did declare, ‘thou fearest Saint Jeremy, friend of the poor, because he shall take from thee in taxation much more even than Herod, and so thou attackest the meek and honest saviour of this land.’ 2\\nAnd she did reply, ‘I shall not call ye dimwits, for it is the season of goodwill, but tis not Saint Jeremy who shall tax me, nay, not even if he enters the house of Number Ten, for my tax rates are set by Queen Nicola, in whose kingdom I do abide, and unto her I do pay\\n3\\nmy full portion, seeking neither to flee to Monaco nor to hide my gold in far flung lands, like St Jacob, Patron Saint of Filthy Hypocrites.’ ‘Speak not of hypocrites!’ cried the host, ‘for thou dost claim to care about the poor yet doth rail against their champion, St Jeremy!’ 4\\nAnd she did answer, ‘How shall the poor fare under Brexit, which thy Saint hath always in his secret heart desired, yet he hath not admitted what was in his heart, lest fewer attend his next Sermon on the Glastonbury B Stage.’ And they did answer, ‘Saint Jeremy will achieve \\n5\\na miracle, and he shall bring forth a Jobs First Brexit and all the land shall rejoice.’ And she did answer, ‘bollocks.’ But she bethought her of the season of goodwill, and repenting of her ire she did speak further. ‘I have, for all my life, voted Labour, yet now I cannot.’ 6\\n‘But his goodness doth shine out of his every orifice!’ cried the host, swarming anew into her mentions. ‘Behold his beard! Look upon this picture of him being led off by police when he was protesting racism in all its forms!’ And she did say, ‘I have looked upon his beard      7\\n...and also upon this picture. It is a good picture and I do like a beard, as I have oft declared.

See there the People’s mind!’  11\\nAnd they did look up at the stars and read there that St Jeremy was, as for ages past, in third place after Pontus May and Don’t Know. And she spake further, ‘do ye not see that St Jeremy is hurting your party, yea, that his inability even to organise a vote of no confidence\\n12\\ndoth embolden and strengthen this calamitous government, of which all despair?’ But they did close their eyes to the stars and some did answer, ‘you are a fool who doth not understand St Jeremy’s master plan’ \\n13\\nand others still did beseech the woman to descend from the ivory tower in which, for the purposes of this story, they would wish her to dwell.

The US brought in Jim Steele, who had advised US-backed death squads in El Salvador in the 1980s.  At the height of the Iraqi civil war 3,000 Iraqis were dying a month. https://t.co/37UZK24pMT\\nThe US troops in Iraq fired tens of thousands of rounds of radioactive depleted uranium, often in close proximity to civilian areas. https://t.co/MzHihI7Duv\\nThis and other heavy metals used in US bombs have caused widespread birth defects in Iraq. https://t.co/4R43TFplf0\\nThe US siege of Fallujah involved cutting off water &amp; blocking food/medical supplies into the city for 3 weeks. Many women/children took their chances &amp; fled, despite the danger. However men were prevented from leaving &amp; were ordered back into the kill zone.\\nDue to the enormous US firepower used on Fallujah, the city has been left w/ a toxic legacy. One study shows incidents of infant mortality, cancer and leukemia exceed those reported by survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. https://t.co/DJKe00D5He\\nThe US engaged in routine torture of Iraqi prisoners, most infamously at Abu Ghraib, where Saddam’s security forces had notoriously tortured prisoners. The US troops at Abu Ghraib engaged in physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, torture, rape, sodomy, and murder. https://t.co/u5ZS9vLujr\\nThe most egregious allegation at Abu Ghraib are that US soldiers raped Iraqi women, beat people to death &amp; that there was a videotape, apparently shot by US personnel, showing Iraqi guards raping young boys. \\nhttps://t.co/YdbQrH173I\\nThe US tried, in every possible way, to prevent elections in Iraq. The US was finally forced to allow elections by mass outpourings of people demanding elections. When the US/UK finally allowed elections, they did their best to subvert them. https://t.co/uwLKGG2UKu\\nUS relied on vicious mercenaries like Blackwater, which routinely engaged in murder and earned millions to help the US brutal occupation. The most infamous of their crimes was the Nisour Square Massacre, which killed 17 Iraqi civilians &amp; wounded dozens more. https://t.co/XCYCvJRHn1\\nThe war in Iraq was launched as part of the US war on Terror, however the war drastically increased incidents of terror. Jihadis from around the world came to fight the Americans. The first ever suicide bombing in Iraq took place in 2003, after the US invasion. https://t.co/PYy3ex7vo2\\nUS forces regularly targeted civilians in Iraq. This was demonstrated by the “Collateral Murder” video leaked by Chelsea Manning, in which a US Apache fires on unarmed Iraqis &amp; then again on the 1st responders. 12 ppl were killed &amp; 2 children were wounded. https://t.co/viYL34q8RG\\nThe brutal US-run prisons in Iraq became Jihadi Universities where future terrorists became radicalized &amp; built a network. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was held for 10 months in a US-run prison in Iraq. \\nhttps://t.co/KWfhpP6ohr\\nAfter the war, Iraq suffered major destruction of its rich cultural heritage, which included looting and burning of the Iraq National Museum &amp; a large number of mosque bombings.  https://t.co/ETDedNq7JB\\nUS military bases produce an enormous amount of toxic trash &amp; US military burned it all in huge open air pits. The result has been 1000s of US troops &amp; Iraqi’s living near US bases have become seriously sick or developed cancer. \\nhttps://t.co/yumYFNMMxa\\nWar criminals like George W.

It’s called a block list. It’s one of twitters core functionalities. Wow, look here I can even see and manage my own block list from within the app! 🤓 Now, you’re hardly complaining about someone using a choice to block ya are ya? ➡️ https://t.co/ouZBzzwdKb\\n“I don’t care who you block you can’t share your block list like that” Au contraire my ignorant friend, that is also a functionality of Twitter- the ability to export and import block lists. https://t.co/opDkdSDYgz ➡️ https://t.co/73u3mX3d4Z\\n“But but you’re not using Twitter functionality you’re using an app”. Actually blocking is also available in the twitter API. The @blocktogether app is even a bit cleverer- it checks your followings first and never blocks someone you follow. https://t.co/WbHBonxfwe ➡️ https://t.co/bG87oIuLw9\\nSo we’ve established that blocking, blocking programmatically and sharing block lists are all part of Twitters functionality. ➡️ https://t.co/ZDELifxSnW\\n“But... but... I can’t opt out/ I didn’t give permissions”. Firstly, no one needs permission to block you (lol unless you’re a certain president). Secondly, block lists aren’t even the only twitter lists you can’t opt out of. Let’s see what lists I’m in: ➡️ https://t.co/E1jsW1HxZp\\nHmm what other arguments have this bunch of bananas been shouting? Oh “you’re storing my private information”. Nope, @Twitter is storing your data, and you gave twitter permission to. Let’s look at the privacy policy: https://t.co/I3hszlAQUA https://t.co/GHNHOdSRwI\\n“But... but... GDPR!” Firstly, I’ve yet to be convinced any of the crusty crabs complaining about GDPR know what it even is. As a non commercial entity, GDPR doesn’t apply. Even if it did, which it doesn’t, see entire thread so far, everything is within the rules. ➡️\\n“This is a list of political opinions and that’s not allowed”. Again nope. The block list is a list consisting of people that in my opinion spread misinformation, are time wasters, send graphic pictures, or send abuse. I’m entitled to that view, or would you censor me? ➡️\\nI mean, the fact that many of em share one or two of the same views is largely irrelevant - it’s not a list of antichoicers, it’s a list of silly sausages that in my opinion are better ignored. ➡️ https://t.co/xQEkwBK7Lh\\nAlso, I’ve seen screenshots of “threats” from someone that’s been blocked who also has me blocked- you are literally complaining about something that you’ve also done- exercised your freedom to block someone. *facepalm* ➡️ https://t.co/ERsbUjZD8d\\n“But you’re creating an echo chamber” So what? If people want to filter their social media accounts to exclude people that are acting the eejit, fair play to em.

       " 'I’m accused of fearmongering, due to my concerns about the effects of trans-activism (not “true trans” people) on research, specifically that which seeks to reveal differences between the sexes. How could science &amp; society be affected by such abject silliness? How indeed: (1/16)\\nHundreds of scientists recently signed a letter to Nature—one of the two leading science journals in the world—which claims that science has neither a definition, nor a reliable test, for sex.\\nhttps://t.co/pyNxDgDdKG\\nIs it possible that rabid Trump hatred has confused people, and they could become unconfused once he’s out of office? Sure, but that doesn’t change the fact that they are doing real damage (&amp; also that they should grow up already). The full letter:\\nhttps://t.co/HW5SXGqZK8\\nThis excellent piece by @SwipeWright describes, in part, “a chilling effect that causes scientists to self-censor,” due to this ideology. Reasonable people are ever more quiet on basic issues of fact:\\nhttps://t.co/5inrE4Fihu\\nCited therein is this absurdity from Scientific American:\\nhttps://t.co/kNjCzmffN5\\nRecognizing biological reality does not make a person transphobic. \\n\\nYes, intersex exists. \\nYes, even human chimeras exist (!).\\nNo, those facts do not put the lie to binary sexual reproduction. There are two types of gametes in animals (“anisogamy”): eggs and sperm.\\nGender Studies and its ilk—Grievance Studies, the term that @peterboghossian, @HPluckrose, and @ConceptualJames coined—has lost the plot. Seriously, the narratives being peddled are absurd and laughable. Except not enough people are laughing.\\nhttps://t.co/WgHhFwtU7D\\nSee especially the “dildos” paper. One of their outrageous suggestions: Men who fail to anally self-penetrate with sex toys are exhibiting transphobia. Yup. \\n\\nAccepted and published in the journal Sexuality and Culture.\\nhttps://t.co/IVZilltBZR\\nThe more prevalent this kind of thinking is on college campuses, the more power the ideology has in hiring decisions on campus, on training of teachers for the K12 system, and on the larger world. What happens on campus does not stay on campus.\\nRemember the google memo? @JamesADamore wrote a long memo considering why there might not be a 1:1 sex ratio among software engineers at google. He invoked personality differences between men and women. Fragile employees needed time off, and he was fired.\\nhttps://t.co/jfxHzDXYtE\\nIn this event, which I did with James Damore, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose, activists stormed out when I made the outlandish claim that men and women are, on average, physically different (19 min-ish):\\nhttps://t.co/pSE2iH7Zqr\\nHowever: the timing of the activists’ storming out was coincidental, as it turns out. Here is my framing of why I find this type of “activism” so dangerous. It is “read-only.” It does not respond to new information.\\nhttps://t.co/gyfiJn0VlQ\\nThis ideology has oozed off campus, into high schools &amp; grade schools, into cubicles &amp; theater troupes &amp; retail establishments. I’ve seen signs advising me not to address cashiers by gender. It’s a madness that celebrates fragility, and denies reality.\\nhttps://t.co/jb3KUkyCwf\\nA U.S. congresswoman has petitioned for trans-women’s rights to compete against women in powerlifting. If natal males are allowed to compete against natal females, the natal males will win. In contact sports, they will also hurt women in the process.\\nhttps://t.co/CLoGWT4VuP\\nTestosterone organizes the body and brain from before birth. It also activates “secondary sex characteristics,” like hair and muscle growth and the lowering of one’s voice. But those organizational effects, including things like skeletal form and brain architecture, persist.\\nTestosterone doesn’t make a boy male—but it contributes to “masculinizing” him. Similarly, a Y chromosome doesn’t make a boy male—but it, and the SRY gene on it, initiates a cascade of “masculinizing” events. Pretending otherwise is dangerous, and regressive. /end',\n",

       " 'A subscriber of mine has sent me this:\\n\\n\"Just spoke to Belmarsh Prison 0208 331 4400 and was told the following: \\n1. You can send Mr Julian #Assange a money order of up to £250.00, out of  which he will be allowed £15.50 a week for in prison purchases and this: phone calls...\\n2. You must make the money order out to HM PRISON SERVICES\\n3. Mail the money order in an envelope addressed to:  Mr Julian Assange DOB 03/07/1971 HMP Belmarsh  Western Way  London SE28 0EB\\n4. You must write on the money order your name and address, most  important!\\nAlso, ensure you write for Mr Julian Assange’s Account DOB   03/07/1971 on the actual money order.\\n5. If you wish to send him  books or items of clothing (no logos allowed)  one can post them/have  them delivered in the first 28 days after his  conviction.\\nBut you can only send books to him via WH Smith or  Waterstones, NOT Amazon. Again  his name and DOB 03/07/1971 must in the  address details.\\nAs it is near to the 28 days since his conviction, the only way thereafter that he  can receive books or allowed items is to   deliver  them in person yourself to the prison reception according to the following schedule:\\nTuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays both morning and afternoons:    Morning: between 9:15 to 10:15  Afternoon:  between 14:15 to 15:15 Fridays Mornings only: between 9:15 to 10:15 Sunday Afternoons only: between 14:15 to 15:15  Saturdays and Mondays...\\nthis service is not available. \\n6. He is not allowed stamps to  be  sent.  You can write  to him in the  prescribed manner including a   stamped  self-addressed   envelope for your  own personal reply, but  your name  and address on the reply envelope must  be in ink...\\n, not  pencil. He  is  not allowed  stamps or  stationary etc from   outside  sources but must   buy the items  from the  prison shop  itself. \\n7.  The prison receptionists I spoke  to were most helpful and pleasant. They said to please phone for any further information.\\nMy comment  is  they will answer your  questions but will not give any other  information  unless  directly  asked. I had to  phone  back  for the  specific HMP Prison  name to be written on the  money  order, ie\\nHM  Prison Services with one\\'s  name  and address to  be  written  on it and   Julian Assange\\'s name and   DOB:   03/07/1971, to   ensure he gets the  money  order\\'s amount credited   into  his  prison account. When asking how to get  money to him without having his\\nprison number they did  not tell me  this, they just said a     money    order  could be sent. I had  to phone back  as I did not think   to     ask  this at the  time of my  first phone call for  the correct  name  to be  put on the money  order.\\nHe is not allowed to receive postal orders or money directly.  \\n8. All letters to  him are  read before he receives them. The best way  to  write to  him and   send him  a  letter  and   card to  cheer him up is  to send   it in an   unsealed   envelope...\\naddressed  to him,  inside a  sealed  envelope    addressed to   him at   the  HMP  Belmarsh Prison  address   above. \\n9.   Online   Payment:  One  cannot  send  any money to   Julian  Assange   online   unless  one  has his  prison  number  for the  prison   service’s\\ncomputer to    correctly assign  that  payment to   his specific      prison  account.  The  only  way you can  obtain  his  prison  number   is   to   write to  him, and  if he  replies with it  you   can pay  him   that   way.  But   the money  order method is  better,\\nas  really  only close  friends  and  family  should have  access to   his    prison  number. \\nPlease  copy and  paste  the above to  other  YouTube  videos whose     subject  is  Julian  Assange   as he  needs our  support.\"\\nMany thanks to Pam K for sending me thie above.\\nLet\\'s make sure there is a deluge of books for Julian to read, and enough money for him to make phonecalls in his commissary!\\n#Unity4J #Assange #HMPBelmarsh #ProtectJulian #FreeAssange\\nTo clarify: He can only have 3 books at a time so not sure if many people should send him books.\\nBut on the other hand, how bad would it be if 3 tonnes of books turned up on Belmarsh Prison\\'s doorstep to show how much support he has?\\n#FreeAssange',\n",
       " 'I went to the heart of Venezuela’s transmission system in Guarico to try to find out what’s going on with the grid. Here’s why partial blackouts are unfortunately likely to persist for a while. I sincerely hope I’m wrong.\\nThis is Venezuela’s main power distribution hub, the San Geronimo B substation outside Valle de la Pascua on Sunday. It was shut since Thursday. A cow roamed among transformers. No buzz from current. Workers said most of them were sent home indefinitely Friday. https://t.co/qX14VqJzqA\\nSan Geronimo B is the only path for high-voltage (765 KV) supplies from Guri to 80% of Venezuelan population (Caracas, Central &amp; Western Venezuela). https://t.co/DGACmEQ5tg\\nThe nearby San Geronimo A back up substation transmits much weaker 400 current  from Macagua hydro plant near Guri to Caracas vía Santa Teresa. It’s been working on &amp; off last 2 days. This, together with some limited thermal, is what’s been keeping intermittent light in Caracas.\\nCorpoelec current, former employees &amp; power expert @SoyJoseAguilar said this is unsustainable. The 400 KV line is too weak. Caracas outgrew is capacity already in early 80s when it launched Metro.\\nIs it possible to provide stable supply to the country without San Geronimo B? “Impossible,” said @SoyJoseAguilar\\nThe La Horqueta substation in Villa de Cura, which sends Guri’s power to Valencia and onwards west via San Geronimo was also down Sunday. This is very bad news for Western Venezuela. They are last in line. https://t.co/M22OFYaClc\\nSan Geronimo B is not working because it’s not getting sufficient (if any) current from Guri. That’s the scariest part. It provides evidence that the government is far from successfully restarting its turbines.\\nWhat caused the Guri failure? Corpoelec union leader Ali Briceño said it was brush fire under the 765 KV trunkline which caused a surge in the system and caused Guri to shut down. There are no skilled operators left there to restart it.\\nIt did happen before. No one is cutting grass or maintaining fire breaks under the trunkline. https://t.co/d4mvgqp7VB\\nBriceno’s theory is “possible but not probably,” said one of the people who built that trunkline. Fire would’ve had to occur in a relatively small stretch, between Guri &amp; the first 765 KV substation, Malena, for that to happen.\\nThere are also three parallel 765 KV lines running at a distance from each other. Unlikely the fire would’ve affected them all.\\nMost people I talked to say the problem had to occur inside Guri’s turbines themselves. And that’s a scary thought. If they are damaged, they will be very hard to replace or repair. No money or skilled people.\\nOne Corpoelec manager said after the blackout a Guri operator told him “the turbines are failing,” before hanging up. He hasn’t been able to reach anyone there since. Sebin is a constant menace.\\nAnd without Guri, it’s Mad Max.\\nThe government’s failure to present a coherent explanation is only raising my fears that something really bad has happened. First it was industrial sabotage, then it was cyber attack.\\nGovernment has already cancelled classes Monday and @vladimirpadrino said “there’s still a lot to do” Sunday. These are not signs of imminent solution to this nightmare.',\n",

       " 'So, uh, looks like Kavanaugh lied to the Senate during 2006 judicial confirmation hearings—even just going by the tiny fraction of documents that are publicly available. Said he knew nothing about Bush torture &amp; rendition. But: was emailed talking points. \\nhttps://t.co/7Xvud9M6hS https://t.co/Yv8c4UTnZq\\nRepublican superlawyer Bill Burck, who simultaneously represents Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and Don McGahn in their dealings with the Russia probe, is also brokering access to Kavanaugh documents for the Senate. He\\'s keeping a *very* tight lid on them.\\nhttps://t.co/uUHpJSqx6D https://t.co/beyMcw1cQO\\nGrassley &amp; Burck made deal where, of the few Kavanaugh papers that the Senate does receive, tons are labeled \"committee confidential\"—meaning the 79 senators *not* on the Judiciary committee don\\'t get to see them.\\n\\nCollins &amp; Murkowski aren\\'t on committee.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/8oF1bHAXT1\\nThe \"committee confidential\" documents contain more evidence that Kavanaugh, under oath, said things that weren\\'t true when, after serving in W\\'s White House, he went through confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship.\\n\\nPerjury? Dunno. Profoundly concerning? For damn sure. https://t.co/9eWDTHsibV\\nAs Sens. Feinstein, Leahy, &amp; Durbin wrote to Grassley today, \"These are serious questions that could easily be addressed if we were given access to his records.\" \\n\\nBut the National Archives practice is only respond to Committee Chairs.

Register your own. https://t.co/8uUgBh9Q5U.\\nWhat’s the path to victory? Clearest one hasn’t changed since since the moment Kavanaugh was nominated.

Mainers and Alaskans, your country needs you. \\n \\nhttps://t.co/NMmU0BiX3f\\nIf you’re not a Mainer or an Alaskan, though, don’t think for a minute that your voice doesn’t matter. We need noise and energy *everywhere,* so Dems know to unite &amp; fight (several are dangerously on the fence!) and Republicans get nervous. That creates room for Collins &amp; Murk.\\nIn the fight against Kavanaugh, we shouldn’t kid ourselves that victory is at hand, or even likely. But we also shouldn’t give in to the cop-out of despair. Things can change fast in these fights. If something explosive comes to light, we want it to be the final exploding straw.\\nIn other words, pressure now sets the stage for new revelations or hearing fireworks to actually matter. If there’s no pressure beforehand, new stuff can’t tip the balance. It’s our job to push as far as possible given today’s conditions, so that tomorrow’s could prove decisive.\\nAnd as you work on all of this, don’t forget the stakes. https://t.co/xW4ipC5mzC\\nThere’s a little sparkle of irony in the fact that it was Harriet Miers—the most recent failed SCOTUS nominee—who emailed the torture talking points to Kavanaugh, two years before he said under oath that he knew nothing about the policy. \\n\\n(Thx to @Bayl3rat for catching this.) https://t.co/TPROCOvMLf',\n",

       " '1/ Is #QAnon legit? I started typing this thread this morning. It\\'s more urgent to post and share this given the attack on #Q on the Great Awakening board this afternoon. The attack confirms that my assessment that #QAnon is over the target is, in fact, on target.\\n2/ The question of #QAnon being a LARP has been debated, but there\\'s huge evidence that #Q is real and very directly tied to #POTUS. Many, I believe correctly, speculate that Q is military intelligence (possibly #GeneralFlynn) or at least uses this for some sourcing.\\n3/ Recently, a YouTube channel \"American Intelligence Media\" (AIM) claimed that Q is a LARP/#Psyop. This was upsetting to many as it has seemed that #AIM is dedicated to exposing the cabal and the #DeepState, w/a rightfully-heavy focus on the #SeniorExecutiveService (#SES).\\n4/ The recent push by #AIM about the #SES may have caused AIM to be targeted. How do we interpret the claims by AIM?\\n5/ Here is my analysis: There are many factors that serve to debunk the #AIM video that tries to debunk #QAnon as legit, namely:\\na. They claim that @jerome_corsi says he has communicated directly w/#Q. This is absolutely not true.\\n6/ b. They claim that #QAnon contacted them directly. Q said he would engage in \"No comms privately w/ anyone.\"[...]\\n7/ c. They claim that #Q could NOT be a close insider since the release of the info would be a national security violation that would put them in jail. This is NOT THE CASE if it is a true insider w/authorization from #POTUS, who can declassify ANYTHING.\\n8/ d. They falsely claim #Q has not shown confirmations w/in 3 weeks of predictions. This is easily disproven by the dozens of confirmations of Q…of connections to #POTUS (tweets, images from Air Force One, pen at Camp David, \"chain of command,\" hand gestures in speeches, etc.)\\n9/ …and of foreknowledge of events (BDT bomber, Hawaiian missile alert, NK deal, use of Omnibus deal to fund building the wall via Army Corps of Engineers). Look at 3/23 post https://t.co/WXPoHas6kU\\nvis-à-vis #POTUS\\' 3/25 tweet https://t.co/vHd4LYeYop\\n10/ e. They WILL NOT DISCLOSE how they figured out the original #Q to be legit…nor how they debunked the current one.\\nf. They also claim specific knowledge that #Sessions (\"we won\\'t reveal what we have on him\") is compromised but will not disclose it.\\n11/g. They claim that the current Q is anti-Semitic…based on WHAT evidence??\\nh. #AIM also specifically attacks other channels that are clearly on the side of patriots and truth. This is a classic \"divide and conquer\" strategy of the #Clowns.\\n12/ i. They claim to \"be smarter than the public\" (having solved the \"puzzle\" in minutes) and to have been invited into #Q\\'s Club.\\nThis behavior is 100% contrary to the Q movement (\"Where we go one, we go ALL\"), displaying the very \"elitism\" that we are fighting.\\n13/ In case it helps, they claim the #puzzle they solved is encrypted in this message:\\n\"Eagles rain fire on the Canaanite as the merchant of wine challenges Sirus. The sword of Lilly joins forces with Jacob\\'s adopted children.\"\\n14/ j. The idea that #Q was shut down by the cabal, who took control for a psyop, w/o making an effort to communicate this fact over many months is ludicrous. Also, it is hubris by #AIM to think that Q would target a relatively small YT channel w/60K subscribers.\\n15/ k. Important to remember: #Q warned us that \"they want you DIVIDED.\" The logical conclusion is either that #AIM is a #disnifo/#psyop channel or that it has been compromised.\\n16/ I believe that the latter interpretation is more likely based on their prior history, especially given the events that happened on the #8chan board a few hours ago. They were either threatened or have been trapped by their own arrogance into their current assessment.\\n17/ To conclude, all evidence...the many confirmations and the escalating attacks on #Q and efforts at division of #Patriots...point to #QAnon being a legit insider source providing real intel.\\n19/ The recent disinfo campaign and direct attack on #QAnon\\'s GA board today compel us to analyze. Please retweet/comment to engage a vigorous analysis/discussion. Our goal should be the #Truth and not to prove an embedded position.\\n/END',\n",
       " 'Hi @Liz_Cheney, I worked at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, where I gave tours to tens of thousands of folks, introducing them to things everyone should know about the Holocaust, things you\\'d know if you actually visited. @AOC is right... (thread) https://t.co/D6qirFASmf\\nFirst, 6 million Jewish people were slaughtered out of anti-Semitic hatred, but 17 million people total were systematically murdered. This included persons with disabilities, Roma, Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, LGBTQ folks, and other groups. Don\\'t erase that. \\n\\n(image: @HolocaustMuseum) https://t.co/xcXMJTMv8L\\nFor several years, there was a popular exhibit at @HolocaustMuseum called “Some Were Neighbors”. It meant to highlight how the Third Reich would not have come about without the complicity of civilians. Ordinary folks. Neighbors.\\nThe genius of the “Some Were Neighbors” exhibit is that it didn’t hold back. It talks about how doctors, lawyers, teachers, police officers—upstanding citizens—directly sold out their friends and neighbors (Jewish + others). Specific stories. Brutal stories. Violence + betrayal.\\nThroughout the exhibit were examples of real people who may have not worn Nazi armbands but turned-in Jewish folks, often unnecessarily. Some participated in violence. Most participated in discrimination. Just ordinary people, not Nazi party hacks, behaving ruthlessly.\\nThere was no subtlety about the exhibit. The message was clear: these people are just like you, just like your friends and family, and they viciously bought into Nazi ideals. Their ears and tongues did the bulk of the legwork in rounding up Jews and others to be exterminated.\\nAnd they were led to do this by vicious propaganda that downplayed the atrocities taking place. The German civilian population was held to a party line that Jews and others were simply being \"relocated\" to \"labor camps\". Questioning this would get you killed.\\nThe lack of transparency at the time about these camps is devastating, and instead of accountability on human rights, the vast majority of people did nothing and enabled shaming and violence toward those who wanted answers.\\nYou know what we did in America, @Liz_Cheney? Part of the main exhibit at @HolocaustMuseum is how we turned away Jewish refugees at our shore who were fleeing persecution in Germany and elsewhere. We turned them away, sending them to their deaths.\\nWe knew Jews were being persecuted. \\n\\n“What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other  land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. . . . We must speak  out.” —Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, March 1933\\n\\nThe headline below is an American newspaper in \\'33. https://t.co/2DOLIgpIo9\\nIn fact, as @HolocaustMuseum points out, American diplomats knew Jews and others were being targeted. We did nothing... until Americans were attacked in Germany in 1933. Hitler promised our diplomats that would end, and that was somehow good enough for us.\\nThis goes on for years. Stories of Jews and others being brutalized, rounded up, and put in \"work camps\", never to be heard from again. We knew about this because our leading newspapers reported it. Many of our citizens protested, but our government did nothing.\\nTwo full years before Pearl Harbor, American Nazis held a mass rally at Madison Square Garden in NYC. Over 20,000 packed the venue and yelled \"Heil Hitler!\" There were summer camps in the U.S. where American children wore Hitler Youth uniforms and marched with Nazi banners. https://t.co/3gW1HtyTaT\\nThere were able to do this, in part, because of people who diminished crimes against humanity, who constantly engaged in bad faith with reports of violence and discrimination against marginalized people. \\n\\n\"It can\\'t be that bad. You\\'re overreacting\", they said.\\n\\nIt was, and no.\\nThree months later, the MS St. Louis, carrying 937 Jews, attempts to land at Cuba. They were refused entry and came to the U.S., where our officials, by this point, were well aware of the atrocities. Just 937 souls. And we turned them away. A quarter of them were killed in camps. https://t.co/Ggkrc0YMFt\\nYou need to understand, Congresswoman @Liz_Cheney, that the Holocaust happened over a long period of time, abated by the persistent excuses of those in power to do something. Out of fear. Out of selfishness. Out of bigotry.\\nWhen Congresswoman @AOC refers to these places near the border as \"concentration camps\", where protocol is still secret and obfuscated, where abuses and unnecessary death have been documented, where children still live in seemingly intentional awful conditions, she\\'s right.\\nI would encourage you to visit the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Congresswoman @Liz_Cheney. You may find its content far more useful than as a vehicle to make a cheap political point while our government under Trump commits horrific atrocities against innocents. /thread',\n",
       " 'Manafort transcript unsealed tonight in which DC District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson rules that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort lied intentionally after entering a plea agreement:\\np.10: “My concern isn’t with non-answers or simply denials but times he affirmatively advanced a detailed alternative story that was inconsistent with the facts.”\\np. 11: Judge then says Manafort’s claims about his declining health in prison were simply asserted by his lawyers with no effort to back the claims up with any support. \\n\\nJudge: “It left the impression that the issue was left in the pleading for public consumption, but not mine.”\\np.16 On the $125k payment toward Manafort’s legal fees...\\n\\nJudge: “The record doesn’t seem to reflect confusion and the defendant didn’t profess to be confused. He does appear, though, to be making a concerted effort to avoid saying what really took place.”\\np.23 On that same $125k payment...\\n\\nJudge: “I find this was a matter about which he provided intentionally false information to the Office of Special Counsel, the FBI, and the grand jury. \\n\\nI also note — without deciding whether I have to make this finding or not —...\\n“... that the record supports a finding that the Office of Special Counsel’s interest in tracing the flow of funds to Manafort particularly from REDACTED and vendors associated with the campaign, was material to this investigation.”\\np. 26 On Manafort attesting as to Kilimnik’s state of mind...\\n\\nJudge: “I think it’s also fair to say that advancing that version was not just relaying what Kilimnik said, it appears to be an attempt to exonerate him.”\\np. 27 \\n\\n“This is an example of a situation in which the OSC legitimately concluded he’s lying to minimize things here... \\n\\nThis is a problematic attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability and it gives rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.”\\np.30\\n\\nOn what the judge describes as Manafort’s “pattern” of “dissembling” about Kilimnik:\\n\\nJudge: “Denying the meeting REDACTED was denying a contact that was part of what the Office of Special Counsel was investigating.”\\np.40\\n\\nJudge: “We’ve now spent considerable time talking about multiple clusters of false or misleading or incomplete or needed-to-be-prodded-by-counsel statements, all of which center around the defendant’s relationship or communications with Mr. Kilimnik”...\\n“... This is a topic at the undisputed core of the Special Counsel’s investigation into — as paragraph B of the appointment order put it — ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign.’ Mr. Kilimnik...\\n“...doesn’t have to be in the government or even be an active spy to be a link.”\\np. 41\\n\\nThis is new. This suggests the mysterious “other” DOJ investigation Manafort lied about is an investigation that also relates to the Trump campaign:\\n\\nJudge: “Defendant suggests that it’s not really that important because it wasn’t about his own wrongdoing...”\\n“... I’m not sure I buy that because the point of seeking cooperation from a person at the highest level of the campaign was to obtain accurate information about the acts of others, in particular what transpired REDACTED. So it’s very troubling to me.”\\np.44 On the (apparently campaign related) other DOJ investigation Manafort lied about...\\n\\nJudge: “The evidence suggests that he decided to obscure what had taken place to shield possibly Mr. REDACTED. This withholding of facts, this begrudging behavior...”\\n“...advancing a new version that’s less inculpatory of REDACTED was significant enough to set off alarm bells with his own lawyers.”\\nAnd then starting on p.50 a whole bunch of pages that look like this: https://t.co/aFQPMWsvhy\\nAnd then one last intrigue on p.66:\\n\\nJudge: “All right. I just have one question for my public minute order. The REDACTED, the fact that REDACTED is still sealed. So I should not use that in my minute order, is that correct?”\\n\\nBoth sides agree, correct. \\n\\nBut what could that be?',\n",
       " 'Today, I was sitting in front of a cafe in downtown D.C., minding my own goddamn business, when three people who were clearly tourists of some sort walked up and gestured for me to take out my headphones. And I did and one of them said: \"Can we pray for you?\"\\nI asked them why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk around the streets of D.C. and let God\\'s voice tell them who might be broken or otherwise need prayer. She literally used the word \"broken\".\\nNow... I\\'m a Christian, and I\\'m not opposed to prayer or people praying specifically for me when done in good faith. But I was dressed femme as hell today with gorgeous makeup and earrings, and I sure as hell caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.\\nAnd I thought: let\\'s do this. And I so asked their spokesperson if she understood how it might look to be searching for \"broken\" people to pray for and specifically pick out a random transgender person on the street to offer prayer. And they looked more than taken aback.\\nSo, I stood up, with what passed for a smile barely concealing my annoyance with this situation, and I asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. And their eyes go wide and the guy on the right starts nervously stammering in front of me in front of this cafe.\\nIt\\'s clear he\\'s having trouble answering the question, as are the other two, so ambushed are they that the \"broken\" transgender person is asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew, and I wait for a few seconds more than what is comfortable to answer.\\n\"You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus\\' name, there He is with us.\" And they stare blankly at me because they have tiptoed with their condescending, passive-aggressive bullshit straight into a brick wall, and I have no intention of going easy.\\n\"That is what Matthew says, is it not?\" And one of them says \"yes, that\\'s right\", and they don\\'t understand that the verse is commonly misused as a prayer for intercession rather than its true purpose as a prayer of accountability. And here, today, I shall bring accountability.\\nI have had it up to here with Evangelicals sticking their noses into how my humanity is defined, and I will be damned if they\\'re going to interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn\\'t bothering them.\\n\\n\"So, let\\'s pray.\" And they nervously step forward into a circle.\\nI say to one of them: \"You start us off.\" And she does. It is quick and antiseptic because they, the three of them, want to get the hell away from this awkward situation. And then I pick it up when it\\'s clear she\\'s done.\\n\"Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends...\" and I\\'m quite honest with God about how I hope She\\'ll bless my new friends w/ a priority for affirmation and inclusion of others. That their community will honor all as God made them and value the strength of diversity.\\nAnd I specifically mention the natural beauty of the LGBTQ community and thank God again for making us as we exist, and I throw-in there a genuine wish that their trip back home is a safe one and wrap the prayer up in the usual Evangelical banal phraseology to let them know...\\n...that I know their community\\'s vernacular better than they do, and by the time I am finished, by the time I have translated the score back to them by tenfold relative to their passive-aggressive \"let us pray for you\", they murmur their thank yous and scuttle thou hell away.\\nAnd now, hopefully, they will know how it feels to have someone inject an overwrought and venomous self-righteousness into the core of their being and--I hope--realize how much actions like these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBTQ people.\\nEvangelicals: you are not doing the Lord\\'s work by dumping your misplaced condescension on random strangers you believe to be, uh, \"broken\". \\n\\nThese people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I\\'m fairly sure Jesus would not do that.\\nSo, remember: if you ever feel the need to do this... don\\'t. Because it may backfire spectacularly, and you\\'ll wind up praying for a restored sense of peace after your varnish gets unceremoniously stripped away.\\n\\nPrayer should be a loving act, not a bizarre political weapon.\\nPOSTSCRIPT: Just wanna thank everyone who has reached out with kind and loving words as I can\\'t respond individually. Folks of all backgrounds get why this is important, and it gives me heart to see so much growing support for the transgender community and LGBTQ folks as a whole.\\nFYI: this is now available in essay format for those of you who understandably hate Twitter threads.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/YOwJwmMwWg',\n",

       " '1 So there are a bunch of issues with this @jackmintz piece in the @financialpost that should lead you to question it\\'s conclusions. It\\'s built around a 2003 study on “fragmentation” and its effects on GDP growth and governance quality  \\nhttps://t.co/cwBWdq1G82\\n1.5 I will accept for the purpose of this thread that the way to measure “strength” in the stupid battle over whether diversity is Canada\\'s is purely economically, in terms of contribution to GDP, because us immigrants are only desirable if we\\'re hard workers, or whatever\\n2 Let\\'s start with \"fragmentation.\" Mintz provides two definitions. One is in the context of the data he presents in this table. (Also, raw GDP over GDP per capita, which he uses elsewhere? Ew). It’s “measured according to shares of ethnic and linguistic groups in a country\" https://t.co/iS6j4FfEsG\\n3 Actually, the study itself defines it as “the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to different groups.” So basically the presence of more groups, or a large number of people from group two onwards, means fractionalization\\n4 Mintz\\'s in-text definition is “when citizens identify more strongly with a social group rather than the nation as a whole.” Guessing he meant this as a paraphrase. BUT it assumes that people who are from group two+ (you might call us \"immigrants\") ID more with group than nation https://t.co/mMs9UhNAzK\\n5 And in the case of Canada at least, that\\'s not true! The opposite in fact. Polling from Frank Graves and EKOS in this piece: Over the last 20 yrs, amidst a big increase in non-European immigrants, national identity is constant. Ethnic attachment is down\\nhttps://t.co/dI9vqbu5aJ\\n5.5 This reflects the raw total of people immigrating, not in relation to the population, of which first-year residents have been a higher share in previous years. Also reflects an increasing share of immigrants being non-European since some racist policies were lifted\\n6 To restate: Canadians have not been identifying \"more strongly with a social group rather than the nation as a whole\" even as \"the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to different groups\" increased. Defns of \"fragmentation\" contradict\\n7 This matters, Mintz says, because at the ballot box people act for the good of everyone if they associate more with the country as a whole than their own identity group. Implicitly that leads to worse economic policy and governance—I guess; he doesn\\'t quite complete the thought https://t.co/hpsk4TQcGD\\n8 Also, Mintz says, if our \"ethnic fragmentation\" was as low as the U.S., we\\'d add 0.4 points to GDP growth! This seems to be his extrapolation from the data and formulas, because I can\\'t find that specific calculation in the study https://t.co/U70KSWnk4z\\n8.5 The study is here, by the way: https://t.co/SiEtQVeZkO\\n9 Also, the data that he cites in the piece to show that Canada is \"ethnically fragmented\"—we\\'re a 0.7124—is from a 2003 study.  That\\'s 15 years ago! You know what\\'s happened in that time? Lots, including most of the active period of the trends Graves identified, cited above\\n10 Okay, Murad, get to the point already. Mintz\\'s prescription is that politicians should propose ideas for \"reinforcing our national identity\" to avoid \"all the risks that fragmentation can bring.\" As I\\'ve shown above, he hasn\\'t actually proved that these risks apply to Canada! https://t.co/kKzO3tEABa\\n11 Also, what \"national identity\" would that be? Think about Canadian-ness. People can have different definitions—is attending bhangra night, regardless of your race, included in yours? What matters is that people identify with Canadian-ness, not what it is. Which they do!\\n11.5 This, by the way, is only in terms of the logic of this piece. I have some serious definitional and historical problems with the concept of a \"national identity\" inherently, a Canadian one more so\\n12 If the only way to make diversity our \"strength\" is economic, shouldn\\'t Mintz be calling on politicians to help immigrants get credentials recognized or lift barriers to employment from distrust of foreign work experience or even, maybe, racism? That would contribute to GDP\\n13 But you see, that would require Mintz to be doing something more than what is essentially throw some misused numbers into an article-length version of the \"banal bromides and Twitter tirades\" he wants to see less of\\n14 It\\'s almost like discussions of whether or not \"diversity is our strength\" rarely yield anything useful because it\\'s never raised in good faith, and confirmation bias abounds',\n",
       " '1. It’s been a funny old week. But perhaps the weirdest part has been the various very strange British media interviews with Irish politicians. [Thread]\\n2. The restrained irritation, anger even, has been quite something to see. It’s understandable that questions like, ‘Why don’t you compromise?’...\\n3. ...Or, the cosmically crass, ‘Why don’t you leave the EU?’ Are greeted with a profound sense of humour failure.\\n4. Of all the many reasons Irish politicians might be cross, one in particular seems to have escaped the attention of many commentators.\\n5. THE IRISH BACKSTOP IS NOT NEWS.\\n6. Let us count the ways.\\n7. The backstop was first hatched in the Joint Declaration of December 2017. Its implications were crystal clear to most sentient beings.\\n8. The backstop was reaffirmed by the PM in early 2018. By this point its implications should have been crystal clear to literally everyone.\\n9. Did anyone try to stop this terrible thing happening? Was there a no confidence vote in the PM given the terribleness of the backstop. There was not.\\n10. In fact, we had to wait for the Chequers debacle before there were any material Cabinet resignations.\\n11. Even more strangely, given the now apparent awfulness of the backstop, the government did not try to scrap it.\\n12. Instead, the government’s principal diplomatic achievement of the entire negotiations was to transform it into an all UK arrangement.\\n13. Even then, as Conservative opposition mounted, was there a no confidence vote in the PM because of the awfulness of the backstop? There was not.\\n14. We had to wait until December for the no confidence vote and even then was the matter of the backstop so terrible that TM lost the vote? 🤔\\n15. It was only after the Meaningful Vote debacle that the Irish backstop issue appeared as the apparently defining Deal or No Deal issue.\\n16. And even then, it was only because a 100 or so Conservative MPs decided, many of them belatedly to one degree or another, they didn’t like it.\\n17. To call the previous absence of effective (or meaningful) opposition to the backstop gross incompetence is  unfair to gross incompetents everywhere.\\n18. After almost two years of hard fought negotiations, an issue that has been obvious for at least a year and was agreed by the UK government is now going to cause No Deal? Please.\\n19. No wonder Irish politicians seem furious. And no wonder there is close to zero chance of materially amending the backstop that was agreed months and months ago. /ends',\n",
       " \"So, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has had a go at Sir John Major for being part of the European elite because of #Brexit. I think it is probably the time to tell a little story about JRM, how he acts and what people think of him.  Are you sitting comfortably...?\\nBack in the day, I started out as a research assistant at Scottish @Conservatives Central Office. As you’d imagine, I’ve a lot of stories I could tell but, sadly for you, you’ll never hear them. However, JRM has provoked this with his comments about Sir John.\\nBack in 1997, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was the Tory candidate for Central Fife. His passage into the seat was helped by the powers that be so that he could follow the time-honoured path of so many with the right connections of fighting some unwinnable seats before being given a safe one.\\nFor those of you who don’t know, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is the son of Lord Rees-Mogg, the former Times editor.\\n\\nCentral Fife was a no-hoper seat and it was an ideal place to show that JRM wasn’t scared of taking the Tory message to the most difficult of places.\\nI'm pleased to say that, these days, @ScotTories doesn't have the same mentality now and actually has candidates that understand the areas they want to represent. It's quite refreshing.\\nNow, if you are on the other side of the equation, you see a toff turn up with his nanny (yep, that did happen) to canvass and it reinforces everything you think about Tories. The powers that be seemed to miss that obvious consequence of placing @Jacob_Rees_Mogg in Central Fife.\\nStill, at SCUCO (Scottish Central Office) it was our job to brief the candidates. As a lowly research assistant, I didn’t brief many as it was thought that they would probably want to be briefed by the head honcho (@iainastewart - now MP for Milton Keynes).\\nOn the face of it, having a visit from a candidate who was the multi-millionaire son of Lord Rees-Mogg should have been quite a thing. We were used to VIP visits and we knew who got treated how and why. But somehow…\\nMysteriously, the day Jacob Rees-Mogg visited, everyone (including Iain) was busy. I mean really busy. Weirdly, everyone was there but everyone was so, so busy that nobody could brief him and the welcome was beyond short.\\nAnd so, Jacob Rees-Mogg was ushered in to my office.\\nHe sat opposite me, looked down his nose and listened as I started the briefing. It soon became clear that the briefing was of no interest to him at all. There was nothing I could tell him that he did not think he already knew (he didn't, of course, but he thought he did)\\nIn my time at SCUCO, I met and worked with people from the PM, cabinet ministers, MPs, councillors, Lords and Ladies and, I can say without fear of contradiction that the sneering sense of superiority during that half an hour was something I had never come across before or since.\\nHe was, he told me, in Scotland for a few hours to knock on some doors with Nanny and then he would be going back home. Such was his commitment – and also his contempt for the people of Central Fife.\\nHe left and I never heard from him again – indeed, I think @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was just about the only candidate in that election that never bothered asking a research question or policy clarification.\\nAs an aside, only one other person has ever refused a briefing from me and that, by some incredible coincidence, was @BorisJohnson – and it was made clear to me that if I wrote one, he would not read it. I suppose these #Brexit-ers aren't keen on facts.\\nBy contrast, I was sat in my office one day, typing, concentrating on the screen when I was suddenly aware of someone walking into my room. I looked up as he held out his hand and said “Hello, I’m John Major!” No pretence. No ‘do you not know who I am’. No ‘I’m better than you’.\\nIt was just a greeting that assumed nothing but was genuinely meant. We talked for a couple of minutes (I mentioned that we’d met before and we talked briefly about that before he remembered it) and then he was gone. His last words were “Thank you for everything you are doing.”\\nOf course, Sir John did not need to thank me. I was doing it because of him and what he stood for. I would have done it if he hadn't paid me. And, anyway, why thank me? It was my job. But he did. And that says something about him.\\nAt the end of the day, @jacob_rees_mogg will never amount to anything or achieve anything without the help of others. He is the very epitome of the British elite establishment that cares about nothing other than feathering their own nests - something #Brexit facilitates.\\n.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg can say what he wants about Sir John Major but, the bottom line is this: John Major is a member of no elite. He came from nothing, worked his way up &amp; he has more natural class, sense &amp; style than JRM or his ilk could ever hope for. And that will always be true.\",\n",

He neither receives a special, age-appropriate diet nor a diet specific for his health condition. All residents are served the same meals and no accommodations are made for serious medical and dietary needs\"\\n\"The medical staff told me that I need to “force feed” my son if he won’t eat.\"\\n\\n(Any doctors out there? Is this advice good advice? It sounds like terrible advice to us.)\\n\"I’ve been trying for weeks to get his medical records.\" Staff at the Karnes detention center have refused to share them.\\n\"The medical staff has on more than one occasion told me that I need to force feed my one-year old son if he doesn’t want to drink milk or eat. When I do this, he vomits and\\ngets sick—I’ve told them this repeatedly.\"\\n\"Diarrhea in children can become dangerous quickly and as his father, I feel helpless knowing that his condition could become more complicated at any moment. How much longer can a one-year-old baby not eat and suffer from painful, dehydrating diarrhea before something is\\ndone?\"\\n\"I have lost weight since being detained at Karnes. My pants are constantly sagging because of my weight loss. I cannot fathom the effects on my son’s body.\"\\n\"In addition to the diarrhea, my son has developed a cough and runny nose that won’t go away.\"\\n\"My son cannot sleep in detention at Karnes. He cries all night and is constantly woken up by all of the noise. He is having difficulty breathing and seems to have stomach pain, but I don’t know exactly the source of his pain because he can’t talk.\"\\n\"At night, the guards check on us every few hours and are we shaken by the sounds of the guards opening and closing doors at all hours of the night.\"\\n\"Prolonged detention with a one-year-old baby is an overwhelming, suffocating feeling. I do not feel like I can father my child here. I do not feel that I have control of his care.\"\\n\"Babies do not speak, but they see &amp; feel what happens. I know my son feels the pressure of our prolonged detention &amp; cries because of it. He\\nmay be little, but he does not want to be here. I feel depressed knowing the effect that our prolonged detention is having on my son.\"\\nThis father and his son are getting ready to spend night 22 at the Karnes detention center. \\n\\nWe\\'re desperately need your help to tag @ICEgov and demand they release this family. Please do it now, and again in the morning if they are not released.

       " 'I hope you\\'ll check out our @WXXINews story on how a local suburban district handled a Black History Month project that went wrong. I want to provide a little background. \\n\\n(Thread.)\\n\\nhttps://t.co/eYdUQMiYNE\\n2) Pittsford is one of the highly ranked districts in New York State. Like many suburban districts, it\\'s mostly white: 78% white students, and 99.4% white teachers, according to the latest numbers we have. \\n\\nThere are 481 teachers in the district. 478 are white. One is black.\\n3) If Pittsford\\'s teaching staff was proportional to its student body, the district would need to immediately hire another 14 black teachers. \\n\\n(By the way, this issue is not unique to Pittsford, at all.)\\n4) The question is, does a lack of representation impact teaching and learning? \\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at the botched Black History Month project. It happened at a Pittsford elementary school. The fifth grade assignment: honor 100 black inventors. Students created posters.\\n5) The students created the posters. The teachers hung them in the hallways for the month of February. \\n\\nOn March 1st, Dr. Jerome Jean-Gilles was there, picking up his two young children. They are an African American family.\\n6) Jerome noticed the posters seemed off. Wrong names, information. But then he saw a string of posters that included the name of a black inventor, but a photo of a white man. \\n\\nHe wondered: what on Earth is this about? White people getting credit for black inventions?\\n7) He took pictures of the posters; our story has three of them. We tried to figure out what happened. Let\\'s look at these three.\\n8) One poster is for Powell Johnson, inventor of protective eyewear. The photo is of President Andrew Johnson, a man who routinely described African Americans as inferior. A google search produces no help in determining how a racist president was depicted on this poster.\\n9) Then you have a poster for Alexander P. Ashbourne, refiner of coconut oil. The white man depicted is apparently Arthur James Balfour, former prime minister of England. No idea how that mistake was made.\\n10) Then you have William Purvis, an African American who patented an improved hand stamp during the 1800s. The white man on the poster is Edward William Purvis, a British army officer. A google image search lists the Briton third.\\n11) So how did these posters, designed to honor Black History, and which instead depicted white men, end up hanging in the school hallway? Superintendent Mike Pero says the project was ungraded. Students handed them in; teachers hung them up. No checking for accuracy.\\n12) But how could these obviously wrong posters hang in the hallway for several weeks without correction? The staff is almost all white; no one noticed. \\n\\nIt required a black parent to see the errors. \\n\\nParents tell me: this is what happens when you have an all-white staff. But:\\n13) Superintendent Mike Pero flatly denies that. I asked if the incident could have been avoided with more diversity on staff. \\n\\n\"No. I don’t think diversity in the teaching staff had anything to do with this incident,\" he said.\\n14) Dr. Jean-Gilles was reluctant to talk to me. He does not seek attention. He wanted a meeting, and a guarantee that the mistakes would be corrected. \\n\\nHe was told the project would not be redone; too much time had passed, and the district was concerned it could be politicized.\\n15) Pero: \"What we don’t want is for our staff to ever feel defensive or they’re on their heels or they’re going to be publicly shamed for doing something that has good intentions.\" \\n\\nHe added that the district owns this failure, and will make sure it is not repeated.\\n16) Jerome\\'s response: If this\\'d been a botched math lesson, of course it would be corrected. Why is a botched Black History project ignored?\\n\\n\"They didn’t even address this to the students. What’s the point of the school? If you’re not educating the students, what’s the point?”\\n17) Some parents have called for a Pittsford community forum. Superintendent Pero told me that this is not the right time for that kind of meeting, but the district is working with a new inclusivity committee. That work is meant to make all students and families feel welcome.\\n18) Dr. Jean-Gilles, meanwhile, is left wondering what to do next. He says he\\'s entirely unsatisfied. He believes more diversity on the teaching staff would have made a difference. \\n\\nWhile Pero disagrees, he says he cares about representation on staff.\\n19/end) You can decide for yourself if you think an almost entirely all-white staff contributed to this breakdown. Meanwhile, WXXI will compile updated numbers on local districts. In three years, has anything changed? Care to guess?',\n",
       " \"1 THREAD- Donald Trump’s Frontotemporal Dementia. Trump has a physical on 2/8. In a panicked move, he named Dr Ronny Jackson as his Medical Advisor 6 days beforehand. Ronny gave him the fantasy physical last yr &amp; is under investigation. This feels very much like Trump is cornered\\n2 A real physical for someone in Trump’s condition would immediately trigger a referral to a neurological team to further evaluate his symptoms &amp; deterioration. Most likely, White House Doctor Sean Conley isn’t giving Trump a pass on his condition or glowing review like Ronny did\\n3 It is possible Trump wants Ronny to do another sham exam. There is also the possibility that Trump is in a jam &amp; wants Ronny there to control the results other doctors get. By looking to Ronny, it may be a sign Trump's doctors are not going to play along with the health charade\\n4 Dementia patients have an initial time period where they can work &amp; live a normal life. Trump’s enablers extended his time in an executive role far beyond any rational measure. Grifters gotta grift &amp; this family, so bereft of integrity, needs him as Pres to maximize their grift\\n5 Trump is in denial. He will never admit to Dementia. Even when he’s in a wheelchair &amp; can’t speak the Trumpsters will claim it’s something else. Dementia to Trump, would end his greatness. Ivanka &amp; the rest of them must know what’s happening, but if they act, they are at risk.\\n6 I suspect Dr Harold Bornstein saw it or gave him softened bad news like “they are just senior moments, stay active”. Doctors don’t like to destroy patients hopes. Knowing dementia moves slowly at first, they will tone down the alarm &amp; eventually give a referral to a neurologist\\n7 Normally the public would not be diagnosing Trump from afar. It’s usually a private matter- the patient lightens their load and withdraws from public life. What we have with Trump is a unique spectacle- a TV President in mid stage dementia with an active cover up taking place.\\n8 He’s not faking. His symptoms go way back. I saw it when he announced his run. They are obvious &amp; extreme now. Don’t worry he’s not getting off. He doesn’t have a legal guardian yet &amp; he committed all his crimes when he knew of a concept some people follow called right vs wrong\\n9 Dementia didn’t make Trump a narcissistic criminal &amp; traitor. He is a narcissistic criminal &amp; traitor who developed dementia. He will be held responsible &amp; won’t escape punishment. The evil in his soul is laid bare by dementia, while most sociopaths are better at concealing it\\n10 Trump’s dementia became much more obvious at the G7 in June 2018. This thread within a thread has a large amount of further detail.     https://t.co/vGMjyE22kc\\n11 Trump's dementia, as expected, was even more pronounced in Paris this fall, where he mostly stayed in his room and made this wobbly walk from his limo. Balance issues will steadily worsen and lead to a wheelchair. \\nhttps://t.co/3wEKi3dUqW\\n12 Trump has new recent symptoms of dementia. He’s not just slurring, he can’t form certain sounds at all and drops the entire syllable when speaking. Like this:  https://t.co/gj2HFDGkXA\\n13 He is losing his memory now. He couldn’t remember Michael Cohen’s father-in-law’s name in one interview. Days later, in another interview he couldn’t remember what he said about the father-in-law. “I did have to read what I said. What did I say? I don’t know. What did I say?”\\n14 Trump is dominated by dementia now. We are also dominated by it. The majority of the news is really about Trump’s aberrant behavior. Stop and think about that. Here’s a fresh list of Trump’s obvious dementia symptoms: https://t.co/soqjMPkt2S\\n15 What is it? Frontotemporal Dementia has a few sub forms. I suspect his is PSP- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. It takes a neurological exam, workup, baseline, MRI &amp; time comparison to nail it down. Without getting in to Tau protein info, basically brain cells steadily die off.\\n16 The public will eventually learn the diagnosis. Once Trump is yanked from office, his lawyers may try to leverage it with home detention before trial, instead of the specially built prison/nursing home setup that he will live his remaining days in. He remains a security risk.\\n17 Trump is being propped up by:\\n-A WH that has become a luxury assisted living center.\\n-Enablers who want to extend their own positions &amp; priorities\\n-Probably a drug cocktail like Memantine, Levodopa, Zoloft for memory movement &amp; mood.\\n-The Adderall rumors are probably true too.\\n18 A message for the Media: You are missing a big one. The reporter that exposes the coverup of Trump's health issues will have a bombshell story. The drugs, the enablers, the near disasters. Even Ronny doing a venogram &amp; neck ultrasound after a slurring incident was glossed over\\n19 END Eventually Trump will become incapacitated. Clinically said, the prognosis is poor. There are zero dementia survivors on the planet. It steadily worsens w/ no remission. Drugs don't work. The outcome is set no matter what Ronny or anyone else does. Dementia always wins out\",\n",

I waste a lot of time blocking abusive Crowder fanboys, and this shit derails your mental health.\\nThat being said, I\\'m not mad at Crowder. There will always be monsters in the world. I\\'m fucking pissed at @YouTube, which claims to support its LGBT creators, and has explicit policies against harassment and bullying: https://t.co/K9XJGAP7Xp https://t.co/4GUfTDuOXS\\nThis has been going on for years, and I\\'ve tried to flag this shit on several occasions. But YouTube is never going to actually enforce its policies. Because Crowder has 3 million YouTube subscribers, and enforcing their rules would get them accused on anti-conservative bias.\\nWhich is all to say: I work my fucking ass off to create smart, thorough, engaging content for @YouTube, a company that claims to give a shit about LGBT creators. And its miserable to have that same company helping facilitate a truly mind melting amount of direct harassment.\\nMy family sees this shit. I\\'ve had to explain to my much younger sister what the fuck a Steven Crowder is, and ask my siblings not to respond. Its exhausting. I wish @YouTube gave enough of a shit to stop its platform from becoming a fucking playground for assholes.\\nThis isn\\'t about \"silencing conservatives.\" I don\\'t give a flying fuck if conservatives on YouTube disagree with me. But by refusing to enforce its anti-harassment policy, YouTube is helping incredibly powerful cyberbullies organize and target people they disagree with.\\nAnyway, if you want to help, I guess you can go to this dude\\'s videos and flag them? But @YouTube isn\\'t going to do anything, because YouTube does not give a fuck about queer creators. It cares about \"engagement,\" and homophobic/racist harassment is VERY \"engaging.\"\\nAgain, the problem isn\\'t Crowder. There will always be fucking assholes trying to get attention by being bigots.\\n\\nThe problem is that @YouTube is designed to give those assholes a megaphone, push new followers in their directions, and keep them listening. It\\'s a weapon.\\nYouTube does not give a fuck about queer creators.\\nYouTube does not give a fuck about marginalized creators.\\nYouTube does not give a fuck about diversity or inclusion.\\n\\nYouTube wants clicks.\\nYouTube wants clicks.\\nYouTube wants clicks.\\nHarassment isn\\'t siloed, either. Every time he makes one of these videos, his fans flood the comments on the original Vox video. So a piece I spent 4 weeks working on is drowning in homophobic and abusive comments and downvotes. Other Vox fans see it. It\\'s humiliating.\\nI cannot explain how awful it is to see a video where you\\'re called a \"lispy queer\" pass a MILLION views. THOUSANDS of comments piling on. How the fuck are LGBT people expected to produce interesting content in this environment?\\nAnyway can\\'t fucking WAIT to see @YouTube\\'s Pride month video where they pretend to give a shit about the well-being of LGBT creators in order to *checks notes* help draw more advertisers to the platform to make more money.\\nA lot of people have pointed out that Crowder is wearing a “Socialism Is For Fags” shirt in several of his videos.\\n\\nTurns out, he sells that shirt to his YouTube fans, and proudly displays it in his Twitter cover photo. What are these platforms doing? https://t.co/x9F6xOFNhk\\nIf Crowder loses his channel, I’m going to get hit with another avalanche of abuse and will likely get doxxed again. \\n\\nThat’s what’s so fucked up about these platforms: they create wildly powerful monsters and then ask the targets of abuse to draw further attention to themselves.\\nLove to sit at home editing together clips of my abuse in order to publicly beg a platform to pay attention.\\n\\nLove to be an adult gay person and still have my identity marked by public humiliation.',\n",
       " '1. The \"Circle of filth\" in the Hillary-FBI-Russia Dossier saga: FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe left the box blank for wife Dr. Jill McCabe\\'s salary, as a doctor. Clinton confidant, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe urged McCabe’s wife to run for office after Hillary email scandal\\n2. October- November 2015, Dr. JILL McCabe received $467,500 from Common Good VA, a PAC controlled by McAuliffe, and additional $292,500 from a second Democratic PAC. \\nhttps://t.co/8QwDTiSNHR\\n3. Deputy director McCabe did not list wife\\'s salary or campaign contributions on Executive Branch Financial Disclosure Report. He filed on July 8, 2016, after recieving 44-day filing extension, 3 days after Comey\\'s statement recommending no criminal charges against Hillary.\\n4. Even Chuck Grassley, in November 2016 noted that in July 2015, around the time the Clinton investigation began, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director at FBI headquarters, the No. 3 position.\\n5. Yet, Grassley wrote, \"the FBI asserts that Mr. McCabe did not have an ‘oversight role’ in the Clinton investigation until he became number 2 in command in 2016. However, FBI\\'s statement does not foreclose possibility that Mr. McCabe had a non oversight role\\n6. while associate deputy director. Thus, even during time period in which his wife\\'s political campaign received approximately half a mill dollars from Gov. McAuliffe\\'s political action committee &amp; over $200,000 from the Virginia Democrat Party, he did not recuse himself.\"\\n7.

Page-Strzok are out now, a day after Flynn Plead guilty of lying to the very FBI that we are talking about.\\n9. Peter Strzok himself was involved in interviewing Hillary without Comey\\'s presence, and shortly thereafter Comey decided that no criminal charges needed to be filed against Hillary. He also may have tried to obstruct dossier investigation. See below. \\nhttps://t.co/CmTrmrNulU\\n10. Strzok interviewed Hillary, Remember Loretta Lynch Bill Clinton Tarmac meeting? The FBI tried to cover that up as well: Thanks to Judicial watch:\\n11. In one email official wrote “we need to find that guy.” In another Phoenix FBI office was contacted “in an attempt to stem further damage.” FBI official working on Lynch’s security detail went so far as to suggest non-disclosure agreements to keep full facts from coming forth\\n12. This Just broke literally 28 minutes ago: Peter Strzok was the person who changed Clinton\\'s actions as \"grossly negligent\" to \"extremely careless\". All this information coming a couple days after Flynn plead guilty: Ponder that \\nhttps://t.co/mMJlVaJdlw\\n13.

       " 'Today, The @Tennessean published one of the strangest stories of my career. Actually, the article itself isn\\'t that weird, but the story behind the story is bonkers. This is a thread. Here we go. 1/\\nI began this reporting four years ago at another newspaper 1,900 miles away. In 2015, I was working at @MyDesert in Palm Springs, California. It was a few days before I took a vacation. A private eye I knew – Bill – called me. He said he found something big. It felt clandestine.\\nI liked Bill, but I didn’t exactly trust him. He was a long-winded 70-something curmudgeon with a gravely voice who always told stories about his own greatness. (We have that in common.). With Bill, it was hard to tell truth from a boast. But I was so intrigued.\\nI drive to Bill’s house. His home office is a wild mess – weird electronics and case files and shotgun shells are scattered across his desk. I can’t remember if he had a claymore or if that was Ron Swanson. Maybe both.\\nBill hands me a tube of prescription skin cream. (It looks like the blue creams in this photo.) I notice the name on the tube is not Bill. This is someone else\\'s medicine. Bill says the cream is worth thousands of dollars. I roll my eyes. https://t.co/H6cqdcs02X\\nBill tells me a story. He says he stumbled upon a conspiracy where doctors in Tennessee are prescribing bullshit pain/scar cream to Marines in California. He thinks the goal is to defraud the government. Bill says he is working with the feds to catch these people.\\nI don’t buy it. I think Bill either discovered nothing or inflated his role in a small investigation. But I interview him just in case. Proof, he says, will come from a whistleblower lawsuit, but suit will be sealed for a while. I have to believe him, he says. I don\\'t.\\nThen Bill says something that sticks with me. The Tennessee doctor is named Susy. He says this twice: “Who has ever heard of a doctor named Susy?” I’m insulted. My mother, a bad ass who could do anything, is named Susan.\\nI thank Bill and leave. I go on vacation to attend the wedding of one of my best friends. We are drunk and merry. I forget all about the pain cream. I go back to work and focus on other stories.\\nIt is now 2018. After years of covering cops in the California desert, I got a new job as the health care reporter at The Tennessean in Nashville. I\\'m out of my element and I\\'m scared. I decide to work twice as hard so no one will notice.\\nI start reading all our old health stories, studying my new home and my new beat. One night, I come across a short, forgettable story about two doctors at an East Tennessee clinic who confessed to defrauding the military with pain cream. https://t.co/Wdj8chyjHg\\nOne of the doctors is Susan Vergot. She goes by Susy. \\n\\n\"Who\\'s ever heard of a doctor named Susy?\"\\nI read everything I can find about her case. It turns out Susan Vergot and another doctor, Carl Lindblad, prescribed needless pain cream to California Marines to defraud a military insurance program called Tricare.\\nThe creams cost $14,000, each. The whole scam cost the America taxpayer about $65 million. It was just like Bill said, only bigger than he knew.\\nBy now, Bill’s whistleblower lawsuit is unsealed. It shows he communicated with the feds about the creams I saw in his home office back in 2015. A federal investigation into the conspiracy began 3 weeks after he handed over the creams to NCIS. Bill was right. It was true.\\nAs of today, four people have pleaded guilty in this cream case – two doctors, a nurse practitioner and an ex-Marine. Three more suspects have been charged. More indictments are likely. The feds are also trying to seize property in East Tennessee, including this mansion estate. https://t.co/4JaKmMiQqH\\nOther journalists have published good articles on this case over the past few years, but nobody has the details in the story we published this morning. I’d be honored if you read it. https://t.co/hDqk5pTtge\\nAlso, there is a lesson here for young journalists: Don’t dismiss the weirdos and SAVE YOUR NOTES. I was only able to write this story because I went to Bill\\'s house in 2015 and still had my notes from our interview years ago. @Poynter\\nThanks for going on this journey with me. As always, buy a damn newspaper subscription already. https://t.co/ogRc82YsAq',\n",
       " 'Leaving a big company job for a startup can rejuvenate your career and make you love work again.💖\\n\\nBut landing a startup job requires relearning some things, especially if (like me) you logged years and years at Microgoogfaceforceazon.\\n\\nHere are six things I wish I\\'d known:\\n1) At a startup, you will probably make less money at first.\\n\\nYes, if you join the perfect startup early enough, your equity may someday turn into a private island and 200 foot yacht. But, in the meantime, your take home pay is likely going to be a bit less than it is now.\\nThe so-called “golden handcuffs” that big companies give you in stock grants/bonuses that vest over time are because those companies need to overpay you in order to get you to stay.\\n\\nThink about the metaphor for a second: You don\\'t have to handcuff people to things they love.\\nYou can make a great living at a startup of course, and growth stage startups in particular pay competitively and often with fantastic benefits. \\n\\nBut if optimizing for the most take home cash is your #1 priority, keep your job. Seriously… it’s ok. Startups are not for everyone.\\n2) About your resume: if you’ve been at a big company for a long time, you really need to figure out what experiences you’ve had that show depth outside of that company.\\n\\nWrote apps for an unfamiliar platform? Started a nonprofit? Ran a successful Kickstarter campaign? All great.\\nWhen I left Microsoft after 16 years, I had worked on what seemed to me to be a dizzying array of roles and products. Within Microsoft, that was compelling.\\n\\nTo the external world, it was just 16 monolithic years at MSFT and everyone asked pointedly: why didn’t you leave sooner?\\nAlso, leave off whatever “high potential” programs you were selected to, or awards you won inside of the megacorp. Same with review scores.\\n\\nThose don’t matter on the outside, and just show that you\\'re still deeply entrenched in the value system of the company you\\'re leaving.\\n3) Here’s something it took me a long time to learn on the outside: say “I” instead of “we.”\\n\\nWorking for @stevesi at MSFT, I learned an incredibly important lesson about leading inside of a large team: always say “we did this” not “I did this.” Perfect advice for that situation.\\nWhen interviewing, though, saying “we did this\" makes it hard to identify your personal contribution.\\n\\nI find myself talking to megacorp candidates trying to understand what did *they* do? What specific designs did they draw… what code did they write… what ideas were theirs?\\nBut also, don’t claim personal accomplishment for a team effort unless you provably did it. You probably didn’t “bring AI to iOS” yourself.\\n\\nYou didn’t “create the Windows 7 kernel” or “increase S3’s scalability 400%” yourself.\\n\\nSpecify *your* actual contribution to the product.\\n4) For devs: show true curiosity outside of your company’s stack. Your mastery of Google’s internal experimentation pipeline is not interesting outside of Google. If you are MSFT and I ask you if you’ve used Redis and you say “you mean Azure Redis Cache?”, that’s not a good sign.\\nThis means if you work for Amazon, build something on DigitalOcean. Googler? Build with React. From Microsoft? Get into AWS.\\n\\nThe best big company devs we’ve hired are the ones with natural, proven technical curiosity outside of their company’s native stack, shown by actual work.\\nDon’t say the reason you want to join a startup is “to have a chance to learn XYZ technology.” Learn and build with the tech you are curious about yourself… your company is not in control of your learning. Prove that you’re curious by actions, not words.\\n5) Be a worker… and be prepared to show it.\\n\\nBig companies are necessarily full of people whose primary job it is to carry information from one meeting to another, from one department to another. Middle managers and PMs, in particular, are often defined by this type of work.\\nStartups don’t have this kind of “info pusher” job. They can’t afford to, and they’re not big enough to need it. Everyone is responsible for making something, building product, owning decisions, selling something, hustling. You can’t just show up at the meeting and “seem senior.”\\nBig company folks sometimes flame out at startups because this kind of individual work is not what they actually want. No judgment from me or anyone else if it’s not… be honest with yourself about the degree to which you want to be on the frontlines, making or selling things.\\n6) Embrace the unique skills you developed in a big company. No one builds more reliable software at scale than Amazon or Google… this knowledge can be a huge boon to a startup. Salesforce perfected solution-based selling; this may help scale your SaaS startup’s sales expertise.\\nDon’t feel like you have to be on your back foot or defensive about your time at a megacorp.\\n\\nIt took me a year out of Microsoft to realize that so much of what I learned there was applicable in my new startup job—i just needed to learn to apply it in a different environment.\\nThere’s a whole world out here, free from the walls of your megacorp job.\\n\\nEnter into it for the right reasons, and you\\'ll find joining a startup to be truly transformative for your career and rejuvenating for your soul.\\n\\nPrepare for it the right way, and you too can join us! 🙌',\n",
       " \"I spent the last 15yrs in US in enterprise engg/product/venture @AMD, @Google &amp; @a16z before returning to India. I'm often asked how India compares to SV hot-bed of enterprise innovation. Besides US, I feel world-class enterprise startups will come from India &amp; here's why 👇:\\n1/n First, some market truths - more and more unicorns are now found outside of the US. Primary reason: internet penetration. https://t.co/HQE0dzvza3\\n2/n Strong correlation exists between internet availability and affordability to large pools of value creation. The story that played out in US &amp; China b/w 2000-2018 is starting to play out in India now. But aren’t these mostly B2C companies like Google/FB? https://t.co/K3y080fKka\\n3/n Internet penetration has benefited B2C but has 2nd order impact on B2B. For every Dropbox or Facetime, there’s also a Box or Zoom using digital tools to build, test, &amp; launch at breakneck speeds  &amp; then  in “consumerish ways” brands, sell, &amp; monetize enterprises.\\n4/n “Developer is the new buyer” -- think fewer site-wide MSDN or RHEL licenses, more personal/team-wide Github/Slack/digitalOcean accounts. Corporate IT spend will disaggregate and many top-down decisions will turn bottoms-up where individual “consumer” needs to be influenced.\\n5/n Founders w/ dev-first mindset will win big globally &amp; Indian founders have a unique advantage here: our developer ecosystem is one of the most vibrant in the world. We are curious, engaged, &amp; hungry to learn. Being a techie in India isn’t “geeky/nerdy”, it’s cool, fashionable https://t.co/dxQzL93Jvh\\n6/n But wait a minute? Isn’t India the call center / BPO capital of the world? You would be right.. 15-20 years ago. Simpson has a hilarious take on it. https://t.co/OdwAPJ0W5h\\n7/n If you’ve been following the India story since the late 90s, the top students from IITs were going into BPO/KPO roles at firms like Infosys/EvalueServe, etc. By late 2000s, India had started to shift squarely to product w/ companies like InMobi / Exotel paving the way https://t.co/64fJ90GSTf\\n8/n And now India is very SaaS focused, built and delivered on the cloud, and not just that, our enterprise solutions have... https://t.co/5hprhznDoo\\n9/n ...gone global from humble beginnings in Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, etc. E.g. - postman just raised a massive 300M round w/ huge developer adoption. Browserstack has seen fantastic growth, &amp; Freshworks hit 100M ARR last year (public sources): https://t.co/rKeL0NGMel\\n10/n By itself, India is now the 2nd largest public cloud buyer in APAC, ~50% of China &amp; growing faster. Vs China, the Indian buyer is hungrier &amp; doesn’t care for brand or roadmap (so, ideal for startups), is more top-line focused &amp; trying to get more process-driven to scale. https://t.co/7wkz2JahCk\\n11/n With a lot of headroom yet to grow - almost 90B of IT spend overall, much of it in devices and services that are bound to get eaten by software in coming years… https://t.co/oEFLvGvisc\\n12/n ...which is where, as you would expect, most of the growth is coming from (note: this is just the public cloud consumption data; pvt clouds may be multiples): https://t.co/gKqQttOVLC\\n13/n While India-to-US has been tried before successfully, India now has the potential to be the Enterprise / SaaS hub for local and SEA markets. Why? https://t.co/B9dM8BDTt2\\n14/n  China enterprise cos are either h/w focused or serve local markets. Meanwhile, rest of SEA has strong cultural, language AND use-case alignment w/ India given history &amp; development stage (gig-based, migrant population, etc). Works in India? Can work there.\\n15/n and to support all this value creation, the key pieces are coming together nicely. Vast majority of founders now have prior startup experience -- this is where many of the smartest people are headed -- not banking, consulting, or Google/FB. https://t.co/ppAGVnVMED\\n16/n and governmental reforms across taxation, ease of doing business, payments, and updated bankruptcy codes are providing additional tailwinds and making it easier for founders to take more risks and fail gracefully: https://t.co/tMY9Y4xpNY\\n17/n \\xa0Results? Large companies picking India as their 1st international market, while indian cos going global both in consumer &amp; enterprise - e.g. @lightspeedIndia portcos @innovaccer (US) &amp; @oyorooms (China, US, etc), &amp; @theDarwinbox &amp; @YellowMssngrAI getting inbounds frm SEA https://t.co/h2FjmD8nId\\n18/n Indian enterprise founders have tasted blood. They are hungry, experimental, and live/breathe tech. The next 10 years in India are going to be really exciting for enterprise founders! If you are building for a massive whitespace out of India, I’d love to hear from you\",\n",

       " 'Exposing Jonathan, “Jonah,” Hicap, the writer behind the Metro UK article \"confirming\" BTS\\' 24-hour views for Fake Love, a thread https://t.co/65qS4s8u5Z\\nWe\\'re all familiar with the infamous article out of nowhere that cited a \"Youtube spokesperson,\" everyone took as fact.\\n\\nFor starters, Metro is a widely considered by the general public NOT to be a reputable source (browse this reddit thread: https://t.co/UgENWy37zx).\\nSo who is this \"Jonathan Hicap”?\\n\\nApparently someone who does NOT have connections with YouTube, if his tweets are anything to go by. This is him back when ‘FAKE LOVE’ was released: https://t.co/O2kBktj3gd\\nThis is incredibly sketchy—someone who has a direct line of contact with YouTube would not need to @ them on Twitter. In addition, his public email is a Gmail, which I can assure you from personal experience does not hold as much weight as one from an established institution.\\nYouTube very rarely gives official statements, and especially never to a reporter from an outlet like Metro. So that’s already strike one.\\nYet, less than 24 hours later, he publishes an article “confirming” FL views by a “YouTube spoksperson.” \\n\\nNote that the first mention is plural, “reps for YouTube” and the second is singular, “THE spokesperson.” He also inconsistently put a space between a number and ‘million.’ https://t.co/L5052FA4OM\\nThese inconsistencies might seem minor, but they can actually function as cues to detect when someone is lying. Just compare that quote an actual one from a YT spokesperson; there is a glaringly stark difference between the sophistication of the language employed. https://t.co/8enoNhyoCk\\nLiterally all the articles confirming FL’s 24-hour views from that point on either cites the Metro article or casually throws out “officially” with no source. https://t.co/LHZk4LqrfV\\nThe only time I could find YT putting out an official confirmation for the first 24-hour views was for PSY’s ‘Gentleman’ back in 2013 when he shattered the previous record. The “next” time was in 2017 when Taylor‘s LWYMMD broke his record, but even that confirmation was sketchy. https://t.co/PT2XDgnHnA\\nYT has NEVER released an official statement about the “biggest 24 hour debut of 20XX” or the “third largest debut of all time.” Jonah’s “confirmation” is inconsistent with any prior behavior of YT and nothing suggests that they would take the initiative to release such statements\\nQuick interlude: I emailed him asking for evidence of his correspondence with YT and he has yet to respond. https://t.co/bRLtN6CGDR\\nContinuing on, he also wrote the first article for B*’s 24-hour views almost three weeks after the MVs’ release, again with the same “YouTube spokesperson.” And he really exposes himself this time because he wrote two articles with different wording of the same quote “from YT.” https://t.co/dkV4oXLwbI\\nHe literally uses the same EXACT wording (“making it the biggest 24 hour debut of 2018”) as he did in the BTS article: https://t.co/2LTbr1bil8\\nHe also added a bit at the end for shits and giggles about fun kpop stats.\\n\\nYouTube has never ever released such an obscure statement like this. LITERALLY. NEVER. EVER. EVER. https://t.co/tJaYNlNPMn\\nOnce again, all the subsequent articles about the record are based off of this article because the “YouTube spokesperson” apparently didn’t respond to anyone else’s inquiries. https://t.co/UpangGtESq\\nOn IG, Y* used screenshots from his sketchy article and the subsequent Billboard article quoting his article about the views. These are not legitimate.\\n\\nI could write an article right now about a YT spokesperson saying IDOL reached 5 billion views and it would be just as true. https://t.co/ZNLMktTF7g\\nFor a bonus, he also reported on Tw*ce’s first 24-hour views in which a YouTube rep uses the singular “I” to confirm the view count.\\n\\nNo spokesperson of a huge multinational company would use “I” in an official statement.\\n\\nThis guy just can’t quit. https://t.co/3ez3Zbt5B4\\nCompare once again the language used there and the language used in an actual statement: https://t.co/cefF0hTRdg\\nI’m going to be real—I can’t believe no one caught this. You could smell this from a mile away.\\n\\nIf this isn’t proof that ARMYs—and everyone, for that matter—need to practice caution when reading an article, I really don’t know what else is.\\n\\nWe’ve all been lied to.\\nIn conclusion, what we can take away is that we still don’t know our FL first 24-hour views and Jonah Hicap’s “YouTube spokesperson” is as real as Bugs Bunny.\\n\\nWhether or not there are ulterior motives at play, I’ll let you decide.',\n",
       " '1/ Let\\'s talk about how misinfo can spread from failure to fact-check representations of academic research in journalism. This thread is about false claims made about the number of women who seek \"late-term\" abortions due to maternal health and/or fetal anomaly.\\n2/ A few days ago, @DouthatNYT tweeted that most 3rd trimester abortions were not sought due to maternal health/fetal anomaly &amp; cited a 2013 paper to support this claim. https://t.co/jlKkdogfWZ\\n3/ This claim was problematic for a # of reasons, the most important one being that women who sought abortions for health and/or fetal abnormality were EXCLUDED from the study. \\n\\nSecondarily, the mean time of abortion was 22 weeks, which is in the second trimester, not the third. https://t.co/rGE0CI6b79\\n4/ Here is a link to the 2013 study: https://t.co/xToyeaMG9C https://t.co/c74dqkKjAy\\n5/ Then, today, @xan_desanctis, of @TheAtlantic, repeated Douthat’s false claim, linking to the same 2013 research paper. Notably, she lifts a quote from the paper\\'s lit review that is *not* a description of the paper\\'s findings. https://t.co/j45OuiVPDL https://t.co/cJPkqip5Li\\n6/ After I pointed out that the 2013 paper couldn\\'t draw these conclusions bc abortions due 2 maternal health/fetal anomaly were EXCLUDED from the sample, the dregs of twitter put on their genius caps &amp; said, “Well the study says in the lit review that other research found that!” https://t.co/zG00RclI0c\\n7/ So, a few things: you should not copy and paste claims from a study’s lit review &amp; cite them as the source for those research findings b/c\\n\\n1st: that’s not how citations work. \\n\\n2nd: Lit reviews often contain errors &amp; misrepresentations of other research.\\n\\n3rd: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄.\\n8/ But given this misrepresentation is especially pernicious, I decided to do a public service &amp; fact-check the citations. Plz note I was only able to do this b/c I have a subscription to academic data bases. The research is not available w/out one\\n\\nSo, what did I find? . . . .\\n9/ The 2013 lit review’s representation of the previous research WAS flawed. Specifically, the claim that “data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment” is not supported by citations #5 OR #21. https://t.co/Ql150nmKJY\\n10/ Citation #5: This study examined abortion incidence, as well as ability to access abortions by region. The researchers also looked at prevalence of harassment at clinics. https://t.co/VBFCzXEIAw\\n11/ The researchers did NOT collect data on gestational age! \\n\\nNor did they report data on *reasons* for seeking an abortion, such as fetal anomaly. \\n\\nThis means that one cannot draw ANY conclusions about EITHER of these factors from this paper. https://t.co/6N104euRLZ\\n12/ So, again: don’t copy &amp; paste from lit reviews.\\n13/ Okay, on to the next cited study (ref #21): “Attitudes and Decision Making Among Women Seeking Abortions at One U.S. Clinic.”\\n\\nDo the results from THIS study support the claims about reasons for seeking \"later term\" abortions? \\n\\nShort answer: NO. https://t.co/hUi32Vc9FG\\n14/ This study looked at whether or not women had high/low confidence in their decision to have an abortion. This was the dependent variable. \\n\\nThe independent variables included demographics (age/race, etc), as well as spiritual beliefs, having a supportive partner, etc. https://t.co/v42gCi2zWi\\n15/ The presence of fetal anomaly WAS included as a variable. \\n\\nHowever, again, this study was not investigating REASONS for obtaining an abortion. It was looking at the effect of the above variables on *confidence* in the decision.\\n16/ Nor was the effect of fetal anomaly *ever* investigated by *time* of abortion. \\n\\nThere is *no* possible way to examine whether fetal anomaly or maternal health was a reason for seeking a second or third trimester abortion from the data in this study.\\n17/ So, overall, let\\'s be clear: \\n\\nRegardless of what these two studies found, both Douthat &amp; DeSanctis misrepresented the original 2013 research they were citing. This was the paper that excluded maternal health/fetal anomaly from the study. \\n\\n*This* is the primary issue. https://t.co/Y3fcb4lIaT\\n18/ Second, neither of the studies cited in the 2013 paper found what the authors claimed they had found. I don’t want to excuse this error, but I will say this is VERY COMMON in academic research.\\n19/ Which is why your professors try SO HARD to teach you when you are a freshman in college to check PRIMARY SOURCES. \\n\\nThis means: don’t copy &amp; paste claims from lit reviews.\\n20/ @DouthatNYT should delete his tweets &amp; the @nytimes should issue a statement that one of their columnists was spreading misinformation on the internet\\n\\n@TheAtlantic should tell @xan_desanctis to correct her article\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t be on *readers* to fact-check journalistic orgs',\n",
       " 'Certainly his disease was part of why the public knew of Stephen Hawking. But his most famous result is important and amazing. Let me tell you about it.\\n\\n(note: this is all from before my time, so I\\'m telling the simplified story)\\nWell before Hawking, we understand the existence of black holes as a gravitational body. They are a solution to Einstein\\'s General Relativity field equations; the unique solution for a point mass.\\nBut there was a problem: black holes are the unique solution, so there appears to be only one state of \"a black hole\" for a given mass (and spin and charge). That means that a black hole should have zero entropy.\\nAnd that\\'s a problem, because that means that you could reduce the entropy of the Universe by throwing a system with non-zero entropy into a black hole. And there\\'s one law we don\\'t want to break, its the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics: entropy always increases.\\nSo, you can say \"ok, we don\\'t know how the entropy comes about, but let\\'s just declare that black holes have entropy. Problem solved.\" (and we still don\\'t know \"where\" the entropy of black holes is coming from). Hawking was part of formalizing this.\\nBut that introduces a new problem\\n\\nA system with non-zero entropy has a temperature. And things with temperature MUST radiate. But how does that work?\\n\\nAfter all, the notable property of black holes is their blackness: nothing escapes. So how can they radiate?\\nHawking figured out how to resolve this conflict. What he figured out how to do was calculate the quantum field theory near the edge of a black hole (right outside the event horizon).\\nFar from a black hole, spacetime is \"flat\" and you can calculate the configuration of quantum fields that we think of as \"the vacuum\" (empty space). \\n\\nYou can do the same thing for \"empty space\" near the edge of a black hole.\\nHowever, what Hawking did was show that the \"empty space/vacuum\" configuration near the event horizon was *different* from the one far from the black hole.\\nMoreover if you started with fields in the vacuum configuration near the black hole, far from the black hole, they\\'d look exactly like a thermally radiating system.\\nThat is, by bending spacetime, the black hole made the vacuum itself radiate away energy. The source of this energy is the black hole\\'s mass, and eventually this process (Hawking radiation) would cause the black hole to evaporate.\\nAnd there is still so much we don\\'t understand about what all this means. We still don\\'t really know where the entropy of a black hole is coming from. But Hawking made the connection explicit: there is a black hole entropy, it\\'s proportional to the surface area, and it\\'s enormous\\nFurther, Hawking did a calculation that mixes general relativity and quantum field theory. We often talk about these two theories as incompatible (and thus: string theory), but in limited cases you can calculate with both. Hawking did it.\\n(There\\'s another way to describe Hawking radiation as \"virtual particles near the horizon, one falls in, the other escapes.\" That\\'s not even really morally incorrect, but its slightly more accurate to think of the vacuum changing.)\\nAnyway, Hawking radiation allows one to show that the maximum entropy ANY volume can have is the entropy of a black hole contained in the volume. Since the entropy of a black hole is set by the surface area, this means the maximum entropy of a volume goes like the area.\\nThat\\'s sort of nuts, because it means if I make a room 2x larger in each dimension, I can fit 2^3=8 times as much stuff, but only 2^2=4 times as much entropy (\"information\" loosely speaking).\\nSo somehow, the information in volume is encoded in the surface area of the volume. This is the \"holographic principle\" and I don\\'t think we have a great idea of what it means about how our Universe is put together.\\nAnyway, Hawking radiation is a fascinating thing. And it is the opening step in a really interesting area of physics that seems to be saying something very deep about how the Universe works. I\\'m not sure what.\\nHawking was a great scientist. The world might not have known of him had he never suffered from his illness, but they should have. \\n\\nJust wanted to talk a bit about his work.\\nHawking radiation wasn\\'t the only thing he\\'s done. But it\\'s maybe his most famous (and the easiest for me to try to explain)',\n",
       " \"THREAD. Emma Gonzales is president of the Gay-Straight Alliance. [1] \\n\\nI was president of my GSA too, then organized LGBTQ youth on the early internet, then studied adolescent psych at Harvard. I've got something to say about high-school GSAs in America. 1/\\nA GSA serve three purposes: support, education, and activism. \\n\\nSUPPORT means it is a safe place to be yourself if you are LGBTQ. You can meet other LGBTQ kids and allies there, as well as safe adults. You can make friends who will love you for who you are. 2/\\nThis is important because LGBTQ youth are at higher risk than their straight peers for drug abuse, sexual exploitation, and suicide [2] largely because they are far more likely to lose parental support before they have the maturity and resources to make it on their own. 3/\\n40% of homeless youth in the US are LGBTQ. [3] Having accepting friends can be the difference between a place to stay and survival prostitution, and in dark moments is the difference between life and death. 4/\\nEDUCATION means teaching your fellow students who aren’t in the GSA - and let’s be real, usually your teachers and even counselors - what it is like to be a young LGBTQ person. 5/\\nPeople have weird ideas about this: they could think bi means you’re trying to have sex with everyone, or that gay means you are going to prey on children. You can lean on statistics and expert sources, but the most effective education is putting yourself out there. 6/\\nYou have to allow yourself to be seen so that your entire being can make the point “I’m more like you than you realize. My life has value just like yours does.” And GSA kids do this in conversations, newspaper columns, and in-class speeches all the time. 7/\\nSidebar: I’ve spent the last 10 years working in the tech industry, and I've been sent to “leadership narrative” classes where executive coaches explain the value of storytelling to create empathy and motivate change. Duh. I learned that lesson at 16 in the GSA! 8/\\nACTIVISM, the most important purpose of the GSA. It’s not enough to console each other about the indignities or violences of being LGBTQ in high school, and it’s not enough to explain yourself to others and ask for their kindness. 9/\\nActivism means seizing the reins and changing things. Because when you are LGBTQ, changing things is a survival skill. 10/\\nThe same tactics you use to convince the Winter Formal Committee to be inclusive of same-sex couples will serve you in adulthood when you have to convince your employer to extend benefits to your partner, or convince your corporation to adequately cover trans healthcare. 11/\\nYou can organize for changes in your school and your community, and in doing so you can understand yourself in the context of other human struggles for civil rights and dignity. You find solidarity with other marginalize people whose struggles are the same but also different. 12/\\nYou learn to organize across race and class to form stronger movements that include everyone. You learn that you get better results by pushing those most directly impacted to the front, and passing the mic to those whose voices we hear the least. 13/\\nI see this strategy in how the #ParklandStudents were able to be everywhere: in DC, at the Florida state house, at Rubio's town hall, in the NYTimes. They always passed the mic around and used their diverse personal stories to hammer the same point over and over again. 14/\\nStudent activism in GSAs builds lifelong skills, but it’s also about survival because **activism is a way through trauma.** And here’s the thing: everyone I know who came out in their teenage years experienced trauma. 15/\\nI saw friends lose their homes and their families. I lost friends to suicide. I knew a girl who was raped in order to “cure” her of being gay.  I knew a boy who was beaten, nearly to death, for holding hands with another boy. All before I was 20. 16/\\nThe core teaching of GSAs is that in these moments of pain, when you feel powerless and beaten down by the brokenness of the world, you can do something. You can take your pain, your grief, and your rage, and you can roll it out into the world as change. 17/\\nWhen you take unfathomable losses you can’t undo what’s happened but you can fight on for your fallen friends, in their names, until you fix it for younger people. You can save someone else. And in saving them, you can save yourself. 18/\\nI see this in the #ParklandStudents and I understand what is fueling them, and because of that, I believe in them with all my heart. Those of us who are older can form up behind them with our resources and our networks, or get out of their way. 19/\\nFrom this 31 year old former student activist to @Emma4Change, @davidhogg111, @sarahchad_ and all their friends and classmates: ride on you beautiful survivors. Take your pain, roll it out into the world, and show us the way. [end]\",\n",

Most of you understand the origins of the Trump-Russia dossier originated by Christopher Steel under aegis of Glenn Simpson via FusionGPS and funded by DNC. I quote this reference thread only because it has a lot of other threads ensconced within it. https://t.co/MYB6bDPgma\\n3. @SharylAttkisson wrote today about a \"sensitive matter team\" which included James Comey and his chief of staff James Rybicki. \\nThat sensitive matter was most likely the Trump-Russia story/narrative.\\n4. Recently obtained emails by Justice department IG referred to the existence of this \"sensitive matter team\"\\nThese emails were turned over to Senate Homeland Sec Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, who wrote to FBI Director Chris Wray asking for identity of all members of this team\\n5. On Jan 6, 2017, Comey\\'s chief of staff Rybicki emailed unidentified recipients:  “[Director Comey] is coming to HQ briefly now for an update on the sensitive matter team.” https://t.co/enftMwGFHs\\n6.  Later that day Comey briefed President-elect Trump on some of the salacious, unverified allegations in the Steele dossier. The next day, Comey outlined this briefing in an email to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI General Counsel James Baker and Chief of Staff Rybicki\\n7. Here is where things get really, really interesting, Comey wrote to the other 3 members of his cadre: \\n\"I said there was something [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper wanted me to speak to [President Elect Trump] about alone or in a very small group,”\\n8. Comey continued “I then executed the session exactly as I had planned…I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook.”\\nSo, Comey is laying out what he said to Trump, describing how things went.\\n9. Of course, currently DNI clapper works at CNN, like Asha Rangappa, Josh Campbell to name a few. (Both take decidedly anti-Trump stances at CNN)\\nA day later, Jan. 8, McCabe emailed Comey and Rybicki with the subject title: “Flood is coming.”\\nRead it again: \"Flood is coming:\\n10. “CNN is close to going forward with the sensitive story,” McCabe wrote. “The trigger for them is they know the material was discussed in the [presidential] brief and presented in an attachment.”\\n11. Within an hour of “Flood is coming” email, McCabe emailed then-Deputy General Sally Yates and her top aide, Principal Deputy AG Matthew Axelrod, with the title “News.”\\n“Just an FYI, and as expected, it seems CNN is close to running a story about the sensitive reporting.”\\n12. On Jan. 10, CNN published a story headlined, “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.” The same day, BuzzFeed News published the contents of the “Steele dossier.”\\n13. Of course James Clapper famously said to Congress he never discussed the Steele Trump-Russia Dossier with journalists. Then, in an abrupt volte-face acknowledged discussing it with CNN journalist Jake Tapper https://t.co/xc3FjwDeae\\n14. To recapitulate: Comey, McCabe, Clapper et al were a part of a \"sensitive matter team\". They leaked this story to CNN, who then published it. At the same time, buzzfeed published the Dossier in its entirety. \\nClapper would later go on to be employed by CNN.\\n15. If the impact of this story is not readily felt by you, I suggest you sit down, read #14 yet again then go back to #1 and re-read the whole thread before continuing further. \\nIt is absolutely astounding that Comey/McCabe et al hacked away at the very foundation of democracy\\n16. Rewind a little to Dec of 2016, @tracybeanz recently broke a story where she discovered that the Christopher Steele Trump Russia Dossier was buttressed by a memo riddled with inaccuracies published in Dec 2016, that was picked up by Crowdstrike.\\nhttps://t.co/3ndRy15WY6\\n17. John McCain seemed to be pivotal in this stage of dissemination and propagation of the false narrative. \\nThe December 2016 memo started by taking about Michael Cohen being in Prague (which NEVER really happened) and then continued to propound multitudinous falsehoods.\\n18. What you have here is a concerted effort with active and contemporaneous co-operation between politicians, elements in the intelligence community and news media to subvert democracy and overthrow an entire presidency. \\nThis simply because the president was not to their liking\\n19. As things start to unravel and reveal themselves in their true putrid glory, we will see the news media go into confabulatory overdrive. \\nTo obfuscate, confabulate and discombobulate is their only endgame in pursuit of survival. \\nStay vigilant. \\nhttps://t.co/xoRdlQEGik\\n20.

       " 'Every time I think I\\'m done with Virginia history, I get dragged back in. But here\\'s why Northam referring to the \"20. and Odd Negroes\" of 1619 is so problematic: An historiographical thread. 1/\\nThe idea that the first Africans in Virginia might have been indentured servants goes back a long ways. Oscar and Mary Handlin wrote an article about this in 1950. 2/\\nPart of what the Handlins were wrestling with was the early absence of laws about slavery and what constituted slave status. This is a problem for historians of Virginia and of the early English Caribbean as well. 3/\\nIt\\'s a chicken and egg problem: do laws enshrine practices that are already custom, or are laws aspirational, attempting to create the slaveholding world that wealthy Virginians wanted? 4/\\nSo you can see why some historians took both the absence of positive law regarding enslaved people and the fact that a few Africans did become free and set up their own households and made arguments about fluidity of status in the very early part of the 1600s. 5/\\nEdmund Morgan did this to an extent too in his 1975 American Slavery, American Freedom. Drake, Raleigh, and others saw enslaved people in SPanish territories and maroons as potential allies. 6/\\nThen in the 1970s and 1980s there was a big (and justified) push to see agency for enslaved people. In VA this took the form of a lot of curiosity about those early free blacks. So Breen and Innes\\'s book Myne Owne Ground, about the JOhnson, Driggus, Payne, &amp; other families... 7/\\nIt\\'s fascinating, the small cadre of interrelated free black families on the eastern shore. The problem is historians started to make these families typical. They weren\\'t. They were Exceptional. 8/\\nThere\\'s a reason they settled on the eastern shore, well away from most of the great tobacco grandees around Jamestown. They were looking to get away. And, ultimately, their efforts were unsuccessful. 9/\\nThe Johnsons eventually had to flee to Maryland. Emanuel Driggus might even have been reenslaved by the end of his life (mid-1670s) though the evidence is ambiguous. 10/\\nThe narrative of early fluidity and of the free blacks of the eastern shore has combined into a popular narrative of English/white innocence abt slavery. The English didn\\'t really know what they were doing. That slavery in this period was easily escapeable &amp; not a big deal. 11/\\nOf course there are plenty of historians (and plenty of historical evidence) countering that kind of position. Winthrop Jordan and his unthinking decision (1968). Mike Guasco\\'s Slaves and Englishmen (2014) really destroys that mythology. 12/\\nGuasco showed that the English knew A LOT about slavery when they ventured into the Atlantic. They wanted enslaved people in Virginia, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. There was no assumption of indentured servitude for Africans in 1619 in VA. 13/\\nThough some Africans were able to come to private arrangements with slaveholders early on, those arrangements became less and less possible QUITE QUICKLY. 14/\\nJohn Coombs has done quite a bit of work on this, hopefully his book will be out soon. Another book on this Ibram Kendi\\'s Stamped from the Beginning. 15/\\nWhile mid-twentieth-century historians were wrestling in good faith with the question of legal status of early Africans in the English Atlantic, there has been so much work done since then. The Africans-as-servants narrative is no longer tenable. 16/\\nThe \"20. and Odd Negroes\" of 1619 were not intended to be servants. (See both Sluiter and Thornton on this in the WMQ.) 17/\\nWhen Northam said this morning that those people were servants, he was not engaging an earlier historiography. He was engaging a narrative of white innocence, of Virginian innocence, a narrative that slavery wasn\\'t that bad. 18/\\nNortham joins a long line of people who want to maintain white innocence about race and slavery by equating slavery and indentured servitude. That\\'s a bad idea, esp since this year white Virginians has an opportunity to honestly confront a pretty horrifying past. 19/\\nTL;DR: the Africans who arrived in Virginia in 1619 were not indentured servants. Saying they were deliberately effaces the long and violent history of slavery in Virginia and elsewhere. fin/',\n",
       " 'When you\\'re leaving a big company to interview at a startup, there are some hidden questions you might not know to ask.\\n\\nNot all startup jobs are created equal; without the right info, you could make a bad choice.\\n\\nHere are 4 questions you should ask in a startup interview loop:\\n1) How much money does the company have in the bank?\\n\\nOK, yes: this sounds super crass... an embarrassingly direct question. But it is also incredibly crucial, because without this info, you have no idea what kind of situation you are potentially walking into.\\nYou would never ask this question at a megacorp because, well, the answer is usually \"infinite money.\" The cash position of a public company is also usually freely available. Besides, you probably wouldn\\'t be talking to someone who could give you a direct answer anyway! 🤑\\nBut at a startup, everything is impacted by money. For example:\\n\\n* How free is the company to build towards its vision?\\n* How likely is the leadership to make desperate/rash decisions?\\n* Will you have access to the resources you need to do a good job?\\nThere are lots of less-gosh ways to ask this question, like: \"how strong is the company\\'s financial position?\"\\n\\nAnd be prepared, the answer might sound more like \"here\\'s what % of our Series B is still in the bank\" or \"here\\'s how many more months of runway we have.\" These are ok!\\nBut by not asking, you have no idea what you are signing up for.\\n\\nAnd if a founder/senior member of the team isn\\'t willing to give you *some sort of answer here*, that is a big red flag. They may be hiding something you won\\'t find out about until you start work.\\n2) Tell me about a time the founders disagreed. What happened?\\n\\nIn any startup with multiple founders (most of them!) the founder working relationship can make or break the company. If it is wonderful, the company may thrive whereas if it is toxic, nothing can save it.\\nNotice the phrasing of the question. As a candidate, just like as an interviewer, you must practice behavioral interviewing. \\n\\nDon\\'t ask \"how do the founders handle disagreement?\" Any smart person can answer that well: “They talk, hear each other\\'s perspectives, and work it out!”\\nInstead ask the question the behavioral way: \"Tell me about a time...\" This forces the answer to be specific and real.\\n\\nFounders always have some disagreement; if they own that and show they know how to handle it, it is a powerful positive signal about the company.\\nNote: Be especially wary if you are interviewing with a founder and they repeatedly answer your specific questions about this by taking the topic back into the abstract.\\n\\nThis could show that they are not transparent, not self-aware, deceitful, or all three.\\n3) What is the role of the company’s board of directors?\\n\\nI\\'ll be honest. During the 16 years I worked at Microsoft, I am not sure I could have named anyone on the board. Bill Gates? The Netflix guy? 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️\\n\\nIt just wasn\\'t in any way germane to the day-to-day of working there.\\nIn a startup, however, the company\\'s relationship with its board could have a huge impact on whether you want to work there.\\n\\nIf you are talking to a founder or senior exec, look for words of alignment and respect. Not snark or 🙄 or \"ugh, the board, don\\'t get me started.”\\nIf interviewing with a more junior employee, a great answer might well be \"No idea, I’ve only seen them in the office once.”\\n\\nA board that is out of the way operationally, helping behind-the-scenes but not interfering, is a good sign that there\\'s a healthy relationship there.\\nFun story: I once interviewed for a senior job at a tech startup. I went with the CEO to meet the board for a last round of interviews.\\n\\nThe first board member got me into a room and started with: \"Hi! FYI. you can\\'t tell him, but we are firing the CEO.\" AWKWARD. Um, kthxbye. 🛫\\n4) Tell me about the changes you’ve experienced at the company over the last year.\\n\\nA big company is pretty much the same year after year. Working there in 2017 is the same as working there in 2018.\\n\\nThe best startups, on the other hand, are growing, changing, strengthening.\\nThe single best way to predict the future is by analyzing the past.\\n\\nAnd so by asking your interviewer not \"where do you expect to be in a year\" but \"what have you experienced in the last year\", you get a window into what the actual the pace of growth is at the company.\\nA great, thoughtful answer about the ways the company is growing is a huge plus. A positive is often: \"wow, I can\\'t believe how much we\\'ve done/grown/changed/built when I think about it.\"\\n\\nA worrisome answer is \"honestly, it\\'s about the same.\" When startups stagnate, they die.\\nHear the stories about what the last 12 months were like, and use that to gauge whether it would be an exciting place to spend your next few years.\\n\\nCompanies that are thoughtfully growing employ people with a strong growth mindset, creating an amazing place to learn and build.\\nLast thing: Don\\'t be afraid to ask these things. 💪🏼 You have the right to ask direct questions in your interview. As a founder, I relish being able to share info about our company.\\n\\nIf you get vague answers/hostility, especially from senior people, this is a bad sign. Run away!\\nStartup interviews require you to probe differently than megacorp interviews. This is a good thing! What you learn will help you find the place that\\'s a strong match for you.\\n\\nBe prepared to ask the right questions, and you\\'ll be one step closer to landing your dream startup job.',\n",
       " '1/ Thoughts on Libra (and my first tweetstorm!):  first, zoom out for a second and realize how far this industry has come. The biggest companies in the world are now launching cryptocurrencies. BOOM.\\n2/ I know, I know, “it’s not a cryptocurrency!!!” some will yell.  Well, yes and no. Relative to PayPal or to the US dollar, Libra is very much a cryptocurrency.  Relative to Bitcoin or ZCash or DAI, Libra is not all that crypto-y.\\n3/ Libra deserves nuanced analysis, it is neither “great” nor “horrendous.” This brings up an important point too often missing in discussions of crypto: digital assets and blockchains have *many* attributes, optimizing for certain ones can detract from others, and that’s okay.\\n4/ Lots of blockchain projects will be created and played with while the world rebuilds the financial system upon this new technology. Different assets will serve different markets, at different times, in different ways.\\n5/ Libra will serve the mass market, and be the single largest bridge toward decentralized finance that has ever been built. Prior to this, the largest bridge was Coinbase, which has played an integral role in crypto’s rise.\\n6/ The Good: Libra is built on an actual blockchain (based on HotStuff BFT, similar but not identical to, and compatible with, Cosmos’ Tendermint protocol). Much/most of the important components are open-source and can be built on in a permissionless way.\\n7/ Next, Libra made the (great) decision to NOT back itself solely with USD. This has profound implications. Libra can arguably become a medium-term replacement to any single government fiat currency. Libra is, arguably, superior/above the US Government dollar.\\n8/ To whomever bravely navigated Facebook into creating a currency above the US dollar, kudos to you. That took balls and probably a lot of work. It was the right decision. I was worried FB Coin would just be a lame proxy for US dollar, and it is not.\\n9/ Next, Libra has the potential (and current plan) to go from “a little decentralized” on day one, to “moderately decentralized” within a few years of launch. The plan is clearly to gradually decentralize with time. Good plan, we’ll see if they can actually do it.\\n10/ Finally, and let’s not minimize this one, Libra has a good chance of helping hundreds of millions of people avoid middlemen fees and increase their wealth and financial sovereignty *relative to the status quo banking system* Humanitarians rejoice.\\n11/  Now the bad: Libra is clearly not a “pure cryptocurrency.” Nobody should expect privacy by using it. Nobody should expect the true borderless standard of most cryptos. Libra will never be available in Iran due to sanctions, for example.\\n12/ Next: the governing consortium can explicitly block/prevent txs. You won’t find unstoppable finance here. Again, in this, traditional cryptos are far superior. But let’s be realistic, there’s no way FB could create an unstoppable coin (at least, not in its 1st phase…)\\n13/ Next: Libra achieves stability (a critical feature for most normies) by backing the coin with a basket of a) government fiat, and b) government debt (bonds). Personally, I want nothing to do with either of these “assets.”\\n14/ Over the long term, any currency based on fiat will fail relative to hard assets (Bitcoin, gold, etc.) Politicians debase currency as their modus operandi, and thus if Libra maintains fiat backing it tend toward zero long term. BTC and “real” cryptos will crush it long term.\\n15/ Over the short/medium term, this relative stability derived by fiat/bond backing will enable Libra to capture marketshare and onboard literally hundreds of millions of people. They will be moving partially away from banks, and partially toward true decentralized finance.\\n16/ Libra, because it is *kinda* a cryptocurrency will *kinda* run up against many of the legal/regulatory challenges that real cryptos and crypto companies do. FB has the resources (and hopefully the balls) to fight some of the battles.\\n17/ Libra may also become the whipping boy of cryptocurrency. As the politicians of the world get irate at having their fiat supremacy challenged, they will call on FB to answer for it. These struggles, playing out over the coming years, will be fascinating.\\n18/ Libra has a chance, if they are brave and tactical over many years, to ultimately move away from a fiat basket toward either a real basket (BTC, gold, etc), or possibly just becoming a hard asset on its own (requiring knowable supply with zero or low debasement).\\n19/ Ultimately, Libra’s relationship with those of us in crypto will be mixed. It will be a love/hate relationship, and that’s okay. Libra is challenging the status quo of fiat more than it challenges true crypto, and will pull millions toward sound-er money long term.\\n20/ Anything that causes normal people to consider new forms of money (apart from their default position of \"my nation, my currency\") is a good thing. Libra will crack open further global discussion about what money is, and that sunshine will hurt fiat, and help all sound monies.',\n",

       " '1. THREAD: I am now POSITIVE that Michael Horowitz has the entire story, and is likely making criminal referrals. I haven\\'t done a thread in a while. Buckle up.\\n2. In an article I wrote on 1/31/19, I detailed for all of you what I thought the mysterious OIG Summary report released by Horowitz on 1/29 meant. https://t.co/Sn74N8tqKA This report is VITALLY IMPORTANT. https://t.co/pc46NxzOul\\n3. To summarize, the OIG found that AS A RESULT of conduct (likely DIRECTION or ORDERS) from senior level FBI officials, a government contractor engaged in inherent governmental activities- conduct prohibited by the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulations).\\n4. The \"inherent governmental activity\" I found that made sense was \"The direction and control of intelligence and counterintelligence operations\". I then went on to describe the 702 abuse. Contractors and the FBI Counterintelligence Division were routinely violating procedure\\n5. You can read that article here, and please give credit to @themarketswork where it is due- he has done amazing and extensive work on this issue and many more: https://t.co/JkOOovNUVe\\n6. After unpacking all of that, as we get further down in the report, we see that there is also a PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST violation by the contractor. This further solidified Fusion GPS for me, because Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS (cont)\\n7. (cont) and because of Bruce Ohr\\'s involvement in this FBI investigation, and because we had Jeff\\'s reporting on his testimony, I surmised that her marriage to Bruce Ohr represented a massive personal conflict of interest. https://t.co/BzriwX9tYG\\n8. Then I kept digging, and a few days later I found something AMAZING in a court transcript. The transcript was from a case involving FusionGPS. They took their bank to court to try to prevent the HPSCI from subpoenaing their bank records.\\n9. As part of their defense, they argued the subpoena was too expansive, and that if the government wanted records relating to Steele and the dossier, they would provide JUST THOSE and shouldn\\'t have to provide 2 years worth of financial transactions and records.\\n10. They argued that would be catastrophic for their business, as all of their clients would be revealed. It would also reveal what JOURNALISTS are on their payroll. Inside of the transcript and in response to that argument I found a STUNNING STATEMENT. https://t.co/uQpYg9sPkx\\n11. You can read my article about this here: https://t.co/gjag4gq2uW https://t.co/XpjvqNSWMs\\n12. The government attorney states: \"In addition, the committee is seeking to determine whether there are any connections between Fusion and the intelligence community, which is part of what this information would be designed to obtain\" WOW.\\n13. So now we know that as early as October of 2017, the HPSCI suspected that FusionGPS had a paid relationship with the IC. This finding further solidified the OIG summary report referencing FUSION GPS.\\n14. And yesterday we got the final confirmation. In John Solomon\\'s piece from yesterday, he uses VERY specific wording when speaking about Nellie Ohr, and the fact that she too handed her husband a thumb drive with information on Trump/Russia: https://t.co/72PeIRjlkM\\n15. Jeff had reported this previously (https://t.co/MlQcrjEaDr) however @jsolomonReports uses this language: (cont) https://t.co/HUnlC9HFWf\\n16. \"And now we learn, from testimony that is still being kept secret from the public, that Ohr admitted to Congress last year that he also took Russia information that his wife, Nellie, assembled against Trump on a computer drive and delivered that to the FBI in 2016...\" (cont)\\n17. (cont) \" — a revelation that has raised fresh concerns in Congress about a possible conflict of interest.\" It seems to me that the OIG has already found and determined that conflict of interest in his ongoing work into the FISA abuse AND THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OP as a WHOLE\\n18. It is also making me wonder if FusionGPS wasn\\'t being paid by the government TO COMMISSION the dossier, WHILE ALSO being paid by Clinton via Perkins Coie, and ALSO PAYING JOURNALISTS to write pieces to bolster their work. IN ADDITION\\n19. I posit that the CIA and Brennan will be making an entrance here in short order, given Nellie\\'s previous relationship with the organization. Brennan went to Reid, Reid went to Congress and Comey. Making sense now?\\n20. IT IS ALL COMING OUT and I am CONFIDENT there will be accountability. This escapade is a complete TRAVESTY to America, and all of these politicians and corrupt tyrants who attempted to destroy our country will face justice and have sunlight blasted on their misdeeds.\\n21.

       " 'Thread:\\n\\nI’ve seen a ton of people in the last week - men and women - calling for access to weapons or martial arts training as a response to sexual violence. I get it. It’s an attractive thought. Arm the women so they can have a chance to ‘fight back’, right? Wrong. Here’s why.\\nFirstly, weapons are unreliable as mechanisms to resist violence. What they’re likely to do more than anything is to escalate situations. Preservation of life is always our first instinct. Your rapist might not be planning to kill you, but weapons make it more likely they will.\\nSecondly, people who advocate for the use of weapons do so with the ridiculous assumption that we’ll be able to use them with a clear head and, most importantly, accuracy. Even people trained in the use of weapons struggle with both these things.\\nYou want a woman who has been taken by surprise and is TERRIFIED she’s about to be killed to access the kind of laser focused calm needed to best her attacker? With a gun or similar that can be taken from her (because we’re dealing with close range here) and used against her?!\\nThirdly, even if women were able to do this and come out victorious, it comes with a cost. What you’re asking is for women to accept the possibility of becoming killers, because this is easier for you than accepting the need to address men’s violence.\\nAnd sure, you can say that it’s me or the other guy. But I don’t want to live in a world where killing people is an acceptable response to violence. I don’t want women or teachers or retail workers or anyone at risk of violence to have to become killers.\\nThese arguments have all been made before, but I haven’t really heard much about this last one. Because fourthly, if you want women to carry weapons to protect themselves against danger, do you realise that we perceive potential danger *all the time*?\\nHow do we know when it’s time to pull out the gun? When the guy’s staring creepily at us on the tram? When we think he’s slipped something in our drink? When he may or may not be following us home? When the car he’s driving has passed two times already, or when it becomes three?\\nThe majority of people who call for women to be armed in response to the *worst* violence they can imagine (rape and murder, because if she’s dead they know she wasn’t lying) don’t believe that men’s violence against women is a problem. They think ‘rape culture’ is a myth.\\nThey often believe that women lie, that men are demonised and that feminism has gone too far. The only time they’re willing to confront the reality of violence’s presence in women’s lives is when they can frame a victim in their mind as an ‘innocent angel, taken too soon’.\\nTrust me, they feel very differently about the girls and women who stumble out of hotel rooms and report being sexually assaulted by football players. They do not want to give guns to the girls their sons might rape after the prom.\\nSo we need to understand this call to arm women not just as ineffective public policy, but another shifting of the goalposts that keeps men in control of the narrative of men’s violence against women. Women should have guns - but only to kill the ‘real’ rapists, right?\\nI just want to reiterate this point again: significant numbers of people don’t believe women when we report violence perpetrated against us. Especially when the perps are ‘good boys from good families’.\\nEven if arming women to protect them from men’s violence DID work in the short term (as in, preserved her life over his), there is absolutely no way the people who take it upon themselves to decide who’s lying and who’s genuine would truly accept this.\\nAnd the full brunt of this public retribution would hit marginalised women and WOC the hardest. Cyntoia Brown spent almost two decades in prison after she killed her rapist with a gun - the same weapon people want to give to women to ‘protect’ themselves from rape.\\nIn Australia, those most significantly and brutally targeted by sexual violence are Aboriginal women. They’re already at the highest risk of incarceration. You think the right wing gun lobbyist zealots here are going to support them killing their (white) rapists?\\nAnd listen, I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t fantasised about carrying a flame thrower or a taser or even a gun around with me when confronted with yet another criminal, homicidal attack on a woman in this country. But I’m not a killer and I don’t want to become one.\\nShit, look at the FURY and OUTRAGE that I still get years after making the ‘kill all men’ joke. Can you imagine how these men would react if women actually started doing it? If women killed the men who were raping them, beating them, threatening them, following them?\\nThey would not abide.\\nThere’s really only one ethical, effective solution to counter men’s violence against women - and that’s to actually engage with the reality of it. Sexual homicides don’t arise out of the ether. They are rarer than most crimes against women, but they come out of the same bog.\\nTL;DR - We cannot end men’s violence against women by creating and advocating for more violence. No society should rally more enthusiastically around the idea of murder than they do education. Women shouldn’t have to kill in order to live. Fin.',\n",
       " 'The problem with Facebook is not *just* the loss of your privacy and the fact that it can be used as a totalitarian panopticon. The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector. Time for a thread\\nThe world is being shaped in large part by two long-time trends: first, our lives are increasingly dematerialized, consisting of consuming and generating information online, both at work and at home. Second, AI is getting ever smarter.\\nThese two trends overlap at the level of the algorithms that shape our digital content consumption. Opaque social media algorithms get to decide, to an ever-increasing extent, which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get\\nIntegrated over many years of exposure, the algorithmic curation of the information we consume gives the systems in charge considerable power over our lives, over who we become. By moving our lives to the digital realm, we become vulnerable to that which rules it -- AI algorithms\\nIf Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you’ll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your political beliefs and your worldview\\nThis is not quite news, as Facebook has been known to run since at least 2013 a series of experiments in which they were able to successfully control the moods and decisions of unwitting users by tuning their newsfeeds’ contents, as well as prediction user\\'s future decisions\\nIn short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you’re looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop.\\nA loop in which you observe the current state of your targets and keep tuning what information you feed them, until you start observing the opinions and behaviors you wanted to see\\nA good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us\\nThis is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective\\nSome of them have been used for a long time in advertising (e.g. positive/negative social reinforcement), but in a very weak, un-targeted form. From an information security perspective, you would call these \"vulnerabilities\": known exploits that can be used to take over a system.\\nIn the case of the human mind, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They’re in our DNA. They\\'re our psychology. On a personal level, we have no practical way to defend ourselves against them.\\nThe human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume.\\nImportantly, mass population control -- in particular political control -- arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don’t need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat.\\nSo, if mass population control is already possible today -- in theory -- why hasn’t the world ended yet? In short, I think it’s because we’re really bad at AI. But that may be about to change. You see, our technical capabilities are the bottleneck here.\\nUntil 2015, all ad targeting algorithms across the industry were running on mere logistic regression. In fact, that’s still true to a large extent today -- only the biggest players have switched to more advanced models.\\nIt is the reason why so many of the ads you see online seem desperately irrelevant. They aren\\'t that sophisticated. Likewise, the social media bots used by hostile state actors to sway public opinion have little to no AI in them. They’re all extremely primitive. For now.\\nAI has been making fast progress in recent years, and that progress is only beginning to get deployed in targeting algorithms and social media bots. Deep learning has only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks around 2016. Facebook has invested massively in it\\nWho knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader in the field. What does that tell you? What do you use AI/RL for when your product is a newsfeed?\\nWe’re looking at a powerful entity that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of over two billion humans, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. Personally, it really scares me\\nIf you work in AI, please don\\'t help them. Don\\'t play their game. Don\\'t participate in their research ecosystem. Please show some conscience',\n",
       " 'Okay, so real quick, I feel like I really need to explain intersectionality to white people because stuff like this, even though it\\'s well meaning is getting on my nerves. It\\'s really hard to see a black woman\\'s work be misused over and over again by progressives/well meaning ppl https://t.co/TFn3KwEX08\\nSo, Don Cheadle wearing a shirt that ways \"protect trans kids\" is amazing and I support the hell out of it, but it is not \"intersectionality\". That\\'s not what that means.\\nWithin, I\\'d say, mostly white political spaces, it\\'s very easy for people to confuse \"Intersectionality\" with \"inclusion\" or \"being considerate\" for other identities. It\\'s also easy to think it\\'s all about a combination of identities, but it\\'s not exactly that.\\nFirstly, I\\'ve made a really short and easy to understand video about this on my Youtube Channel. Check it out if you\\'d like to hear this explanation rather than read it. \\nhttps://t.co/NMnoyr3WK2\\nIntersectionality was a term coined by a black woman named Kimberle Crenshaw, (who by the way is still alive @sandylocks ), in 1989. It\\'s a term that she created in her paper she wrote for the Chicago Legal Forum. Full Text can be found here: https://t.co/rU9bAkvp5S\\nTo summarize what she meant when she defined intersectionality: It was about how black women were erased in conversations about discrimination because the feminist movement and the civil rights movement focused largely on its most privileged members.\\nSo feminism, at the time (and arguably still) focused largely on white women\\'s experiences with sexism and the civil rights movement focused, at the time (and arguably still) focused on how black men experienced racism. So black women\\'s experiences had to be measured against that\\nMeaning that in several legal cases, explained in the document and my video, if a black woman\\'s experiences with discrimination weren\\'t paralleled to how black men experience racism and white women experience sexism, their cases were dismissed or thrown out.\\nSo you had cases where black women would sue a company for racial discrimination and then you\\'d have the judge say that it was impossible for that to be true, because they currently employed black people. The problem was, the black people were all men.\\nAnd you\\'d have cases where they\\'d sue the company for being sexist, but they\\'d say that was impossible because they currently employed several women. The problem being, those women were all white.\\nAnd then you\\'d have cases where black women sued on behalf of themselves and black men for racial discrimination and their experiences were dismissed because their experiences as a woman, don\\'t negate their experiences as men. Black women were unable to represent their own.\\nSo the bones of intersectionality really has to do with the ways in which black women, specifically, have been ignored and dismissed because of the more mainstream view of what sexism and racism looks like.\\nSo, intersectionality is about viewing discrimination outside of the single axis view of discrimination where individuals are only impacted by singular forms of discrimination (white women by sexism, black men by racism).\\nIt\\'s an acknowledgement that sometimes these things intersect. That sometimes it\\'s racism and sexism, sometimes it\\'s just racism and sometimes it\\'s just sexism. But it\\'s about opening up to the idea that it isn\\'t just one of these things. It can frequently be more than one.\\nWhich is why people often think it\\'s about multiple identities, but really it\\'s about multiple types of discrimination that can frequently inform each other.\\nFor example, Women who are disabled are at a higher risk of sexual assault. When those women are black, that increases their risk of sexual assault. \\n\\nSo in that situation, you have people who have multiple identities, that face discriminations that often inform each other.\\nWhat Don Cheadle is doing here is called allyship. He is using his privilege as a cis man w/ access to an audience to spotlight transgender children. He is advocating for their protection and I think, within the scope of Hollywood, this is pretty radical and took a lot of guts.\\nI think he should be celebrated for it. But please do not call this \"intersectional\", because it isn\\'t. Him being a black man... and an adult isn\\'t really inching near what we\\'re discussing when we discuss intersectionality.\\nIntersectionality CAN look like a person outside of one group advocating for another, but the optics of this aren\\'t quite that. It\\'s allyship and I think that should be celebrated without misusing the work of a black woman and a scholar.\\nThe meaning and use of Intersectionality has expanded beyond black women\\'s experiences, but it will always be about understanding the ways in which multiple types of discrimination inform each other.\\nAs a black woman who is trans, and thus at a higher risk of violence, it\\'s important to me and my understanding of the world. \\nLet\\'s not warp it into a feel good thing about a mixture of identities. Let\\'s keep the definition and use consistent because it is important.',\n",

       " 'If this is a failed attempt at smashing the table then so be it, but screw it, the truth has to be told. The Southwest loves making deities out of humans and the North is always there to help us demystify them. Thanks to Southwest media and intellectuals the hype goes on.\\nThe hype that has turned humans to deities did not start today in the Southwest, it started long ago when the word ‘risha’ a cushite/Semitic word was corrupted to Orisha and the meaning which was something saintly or divine was elevated to mean deity- funny!\\nI am sure many do not know that Sango was named Olufiran, and was the offspring of a marriage between a Northern princess and the Alaafin of Oyo at the time. We all just know about the deity status because that is what interests us, no research nothing, deify and worship.\\nAnd so it was till the times of Afonja, who became so headstrong and powerful to the point he believed, he challenge the authority of the Oba and aligned with Fulani warriors- Alimi and his men. Despite all warnings Afonja got carried away and lay all trust with the Fulani’s\\nAfonja would leave no stone unturned destroyed the unity of the yorubas and thought he had established his own kingdom, he was elevated by praise singers but little did he know those who helped him rise were planning his own downfall and no one would be around to help him\\nAfonja has weakened the hold of Oyo in the Southwest, so when the Fulani’s turned on him in ilorin, there was no saving grace for him, he had burned bridges for his own ego and personal pride and he suffered ultimately and his descendants would end up being serfs with his tenants\\nAfonja lost Ilorin to Alimi and his bandwagon of Fulani warriors. The story hasn’t been different in my own life time and experience. The Southwest has always produces tin-gods whose greed and ego will never let them do the right thing at the right time\\nMost yoruba people deify Awolowo and truth is, I don’t see him as being extraordinary, I see Awolowo, the same way I see modern politicians, opportunists who at best mask as saints with hypocrisy. The same Awolowo who stirred the waters that brought us into ethnic politics &amp; hate\\nAwolowo, who was the sole reason for the first coup, would turn around &amp; work against a region which was as progressive  as his and help starve millions of children to death under sanctuary of ‘all is fair and just in war’.  A man who said ‘we can’t feed our enemies’ to brothers\\nYes, the Igbos are our brothers and if Awolowo was anything near a nationalist, he should have watched his actions and words during the Biafra war. But no, he spoke all sorts and later wanted to be president of the same country he helped decimate a region in it\\nAnd later became bitter and cursed people because he never became president, how did Awo ever think he would be President? The problem with Southwesterners is that we play into the hands of the Fulani masters of the game and when used  and dumped we get bitter\\nThe case of MKO abiola was no different, he invested in media and was almost a demigod. There are allegations that he helped bring military govts to power and the same military government was the end of him. The same Abacha he helped bring to power made him suffer till he died\\nOne would have though present day politicians would learn from Awolowo, Abiola, all who had godlike fame and were reputed to dine with gods but as usual, they were dealt with by the master strategists of the Fulani oligarchy\\nSame thing is playing out now. Bola Tinubu is no different from Awolow and truth is, he may end up like him, bitter and vengeful. Like Afonja Tinubu has destroyed all the strongholds of the Yoruba in the southwest and all Yoruba institutions have been bastardized\\nWhilst the Fulani oligarchy ensure their structure is intact and keep working on a cohesive structure for the North, Tinubu has destroyed reference for Yoruba institutions. He has had his minions attack a respected Yoruba general like Obasanjo on social media\\nYou will never see Northerner nor member of Arewa twitter speak ill of any of their generals but Tinubu has ensured that our Yoruba kids becomes the mannerless bunch on twitter cursing at Yoruba elders with dissenting voices. He has reduced elder leadership to rubbles\\nThe different Yoruba socio-cultural groups has been destroyed by same individual, not even the Afenifere that brought Tinubu to power has been spared. Even the OPC has been reduced to a ghost of itself, all thanks to the tin-god in Bourdillon\\nLike Afonja, Tinubu is ready to burn all bridges for his Fulani friend. He is willing to sacrifice his own people as pawns all for his selfish ambition and shot at federal politics. The funny thing about this however is how Tinubu thinks the North will support him\\nHow Tinubu imagines that the North will allow a southwestern power house to take reins of this country amuses me. Tinubu unfortunately doesn’t realize that he is a greater threat to the Northern Oligarchy than any of us &amp; what protects him are those of us he is trying to destroy\\nTinubu has no idea that the reason why he hasn’t been destroyed politically is because of people like Obasanjo who know the game of these Northern Oligarchs &amp; plays it to the T. Come 2019, Tinubu is ready to burn all bridges for the sake of his own ‘Alimi’ or should I say Buhari\\nTinubu has launched offensive against all that can fight for the Yoruba people in the face of oppression, he is enjoying his new found fame in national politics but the day the rain that befell those before him will storm up, he will look around for soldiers and he will find none',\n",
       " 'This morning, I did something for the first* time in public: I offered Holy Mass ad orientem, that is, Christ the Head and Christ the Members together were physically oriented to the Father in sacrifice. Just the ten of us, with the communion of saints and angels.\\nMy predecessor at the parish had been writing about the practice in the parish bulletin for a few weeks prior to his transfer three Octobers ago. I think he was planning to celebrate ad orientem on occasion throughout Advent, maybe during the week.\\nWhen I arrived in 2016, I hadn’t given thought to reviving the posture, but I was glad he was planting the seed in people’s minds and hearts. As Jesus related in Friday’s Gospel, “the seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how“ (Mark 4:27). That’s how the Church works.\\nSince returning to Twitter, I started to encounter a refreshing species of Catholic: younger, intelligent, articulate, witty, and devout – “admirandum et imitandum” (to be admired and imitated). A few of the priests among them were promoting a movement they call the #Traddening.\\nThe Traddening, I would say, rebrands what Benedict XVI and others have advocated since Vatican II: a “reform of the reform” in Catholic spirituality, teaching, and morality by attending to elements of the sacred Liturgy that had remained always in theory, not often in practice.\\nIt’s about re-introducing disparate traditional elements, while allowing God thereby to generate an ethos of mystery that the current scenario seems to have obscured.\\nBishop Robert Barron frequently names that tune in six words: “Your life is not about you.” Those words run like a thread through all things Catholic, all things Christ—especially the Liturgy.\\nAt the root of Traddening is “tradition,“ from the Latin verb tradere, to hand over, to pass along. In his exposition of the central message of the faith, St. Paul declared, “I hand on to you what I myself received.” There’s no originality to Paul and his proclamation.\\nFor more detailed understanding of the Traddening, I commend you to such luminaries as Fr. Matt Fish of Washington and Archbishop Alexander Sample of Portland (OR). Priests here and there are implementing traditional liturgical measures, with appropriate instruction.\\nIt is no surprise to me that newer generations are responding more openly to the movement. I liken it to the experience of the Jews in last Sunday’s first reading from Nehemiah: newly hearing the Mosaic Law, suddenly, tearfully, they are moved – by what?\\nMoved by its beauty, goodness, and truth, its orientation to unity through distinction. The Law – or rather, the Lord Himself – seizes them, and they are overcome for not having heard it before, perhaps wondering how they could conform themselves to it.\\nNotice it’s not a series of ritual prescriptions, dietary or moral directives per se, but the quasi (?) liturgical revelation of them – the experience conveying the content.\\nToday’s feast of the Presentation of the Lord seemed providentially appropriate for my first* celebration of Mass where Christ is the head and members together faced the rising sun, although by the compass I think we were looking south.\\n*I’m lying: the very first time was a couple years ago in the company of nursing home residents. Some of them are still among us, while Others have fallen asleep. My instructions to them was brief but, I think, fitting. Nobody bat an eye or reported me.\\nThis morning I spoke of the light and life of the Infant King dawning on Simeon and Anna. While others would have been blinded by Him, they alone among the Temple occupants were wearing the proper glasses. They were properly oriented to Him.\\nHe was the Messiah promised who would, as Malachi said, purify and refine the sons of Levi (the priests among God’s people). “Pur” is Greek for fire. The light of revelation to the nations, the heat to burn away all that is not God.\\nMy personal takeaways, besides the Eucharist and Word in every validly celebrated Mass: gone is the sense of opposition, the pressure to perform. Head and Members together offering all prayers, work, joys, and sufferings to the eternal Father in the power of the Holy Spirit.\\nPlease God, my liturgical praxis for 15.5 years hasn’t been ill motivated or executed. Traddening principles and practices always appealed to me. I’ve been adopting them piecemeal and unobtrusively, as is suggested. They must become more than a fad or an affectation.\\nA la Ezra, Nehemiah, and the repatriated Jews, newly exposed to the Law and to a doxological worshipping attitude: “Where have You been all my life?” Such a mindset can translate to Liturgy and all the rest, unto its purification.\\nOngoing thanks to @clericalpod, which has provided information and motivation toward this priest’s ars celebrandi.\\nAll to the glory of God and the sanctification of the human race; all to the purification of ecclesial attitudes reductive of the priest to a kind of mascot instead of a Father and Shepherd.',\n",

       " '1) One of the most jaw-dropping discoveries I made while researching “The Autism Vaccine” took place in Austria. I was initially intrigued by the autism story when I realized that the first time aluminum had been used in a U.S. pediatric vaccine was 1932. https://t.co/LcHlyDAyss\\n2) This was less than a year before Donald Triplett—the first child ever diagnosed with autism—was born. Knowing scientific studies have pointed towards elevated levels of aluminum in children with autism, I began to research when this new ingredient was first added. https://t.co/ilQGoOUruR\\n3) The story of WHY it was added is fascinating, but WHEN it was added—1932—is important. Before that year, you will only find a rare mention of a few kids here &amp; there resembling the modern diagnosis of autism. https://t.co/8tesoP9k8Y\\n4) It was extremely rare before 1932—so rare that even the most prominent child psychiatrist in the country had never seen any children with it. In 1932, the decision was made to add aluminum to a vaccine because it seemed to make it work better. https://t.co/KBEFZeTrH2\\n5) Within a year or two, accounts of parents noticing aloneness in their children or obsession with repetitive patterns &amp; behaviors began to appear. https://t.co/e1mpfMfRvh\\n6) In Baltimore, a famous child psychiatrist named Leo Kanner began to see children—mostly boys—show up in his Baltimore clinic with a strange set of behaviors he had never even heard of before. https://t.co/jAcNQxTARP\\n7) In 1935, Kanner published a 500-page book on childhood psychiatry—the largest such book in the world. He mentioned nothing resembling autism. It\\'s clear he\\'d never seen or heard of anything like the children who were now being brought to his clinic.\\nhttps://t.co/PJyY40YeKJ https://t.co/ip96IhdPU8\\n8) This coincidence in time was enough to make me want to understand if there was a possible relationship between the addition of aluminum in 1932 &amp; the sudden appearance of children with autism. https://t.co/TA1kL7JXav\\n9) I explored this lead for quite a while &amp; became convinced they were related. It seemed unlikely that the one country in the world that made this change would begin to see autism within a year after having done so. https://t.co/EvG2RndvPy\\n10) I realized later the U.S wasn’t the only country to make this change. There was another, &amp; in fact, like the United States, they were struggling with a massive outbreak of diphtheria. https://t.co/S1AaJ4KcXE\\n11) This other country had begun to launch nationwide campaigns to have every child immunized—with the new aluminum-containing vaccine. https://t.co/wTdts7qRCd\\n12) The US was using a very nasty type of aluminum called potassium aluminum sulfate, sometimes called potash. Scientists in Denmark had experimented with something different—aluminum hydroxide &amp; noticed that this type of aluminum caused fewer granulomas, or nodules than potash. https://t.co/i58AylhKtB\\n13) In Austria, they noticed that aluminum hydroxide seemed to cause fewer problems so in their national campaign to immunize their children against diphtheria, they added aluminum hydroxide to their vaccines. https://t.co/0JivAYp08u\\n14) This would be the first time thousands of children would be injected with a metallic compound in recorded history. A few may have received mercury injections during experiments for congenital syphilis, but this was a nationwide campaign. https://t.co/YeI9yiODCY\\n15) If you don’t know the story, there was another child psychiatrist in Austria who began to see young patients show up at his clinic—their parents confused as to what had happened to their previously healthy children. https://t.co/1It9f6M5iI\\n16) Hans Asperger was at a loss to explain what was causing these children to experience strange neurological symptoms. He saw over 200 children—every one of them boys, &amp; they closely resembled the children Leo Kanner had seen in Baltimore. https://t.co/142V0NJuPt\\n17) It should strike anyone as remarkable that the two countries which launched nationwide diphtheria immunization campaigns in the 1930s using a new aluminum-containing shot were the very two countries where autism was first noticed &amp; documented. https://t.co/vBlIeodUZ4\\n18) Two countries began running nationwide immunization campaigns for their children, with a new vaccine that contained aluminum, &amp; within a year or so, those same two countries began to see the appearance of a new neurological disorder that would later be called autism. https://t.co/KwPFpa3JgC\\n19) The United States &amp; Austria—the two countries that used this new aluminum-containing vaccine in the 1930s, and the two countries where the case reports first describing autism appeared. Coincidence? You decide. https://t.co/QdQy2Baqcv\\n20) I tell the incredible story about the actual origins of autism—something I’ve never heard anyone else talk about—in a new book called “The Autism Vaccine.” It may be on Amazon by the time you read this, but it\\'s now available at:\\nhttps://t.co/AfxR8Sv5FU https://t.co/iZFEqSmhsn\\n21) \"The Autism Vaccine\" is now available on Amazon as well.

       " '&lt;THREAD&gt; BOMBSHELL from @adamentous &amp; @RonanFarrow: A memo circulating in the Trump NSC in early 2017 alleging a vast conspiracy of former Obama officials may be linked to efforts by the Israeli firm Black Cube to target me, @brhodes, &amp; our families. https://t.co/EWUzhJwKer 1/\\nThe memo, written like a military intelligence analysis of an insurgency, identifies a supposed cabal of former Obama officials coordinating all opposition to Trump’s foreign policy agenda. It represents an extraordinarily paranoid fever dream. 2/\\nBesides @brhodes and me, the enemies list memo floating around Trump\\'s NSC last year identifies other former Obama officials as well, including Jake Sullivan, @TVietor08, @nedprice, @jonfavs, @jonfiner, &amp; @danpfeiffer 👇. 3/ https://t.co/Xl7AcHY2S5\\nRecall that last year, a different wackadoodle NSC memo came to light alleging a vast conspiracy involving the deep state, media, political establishment, globalists, Marxists/Maoists, and Islamists to undermine Trump 👇. https://t.co/G89SFqKiTI 4/\\nHowever, this newly uncovered memo is much more specific &amp; potentially ominous in its implications, including a possible link to Black Cube. \\n\\nIt lists @brhodes as “likely the brain behind this operation.\"\\n\\nIt lists me as “likely ops chief”. \\n\\nAnd it also mentions Ben’s wife! 5/ https://t.co/IYgYrbyQMF\\nAround the time the memo was produced, Ben &amp; I were targeted in a dirty op by Black Cube, as were our wives (including an effort to get to my wife via my 6-year old daughter’s school). See this @RonanFarrow piece for details. https://t.co/sPp6n69LP4 6/\\nNotice too the “Echo Chamber” and “Iran Deal” frame of memo circulating at the NSC, as well as the emphasis on criticism of then-Trump adviser Seb Gorka. 7/ https://t.co/rJQQooFvub\\nWell, it turns out, the Black Cube opposition research on us obtained by the New Yorker emphasizes the same issues 👇. https://t.co/EWUzhJwKer 8/ https://t.co/Jzez9JkYvC\\nThe newly revealed memo seems to provide the most direct evidence yet of a possible link between Trump aides &amp; Black Cube’s operation to discredit proponents of the Iran Deal during the same timeframe, as first reported by the Guardian. https://t.co/QbY6XDXA4Y 9/\\nThere are also reasons to believe that the conspiracy theory on display in this new memo was widely embraced by ideologues at the White House, up to an including Trump himself, at the time of the Black Cube operation. 10/\\nIn Feb 2017, the Washington Free Beacon, citing “multiple sources in &amp; out of the White House,” blamed @brhodes &amp; a “small task force of former loyalists” for engineering Flynn’s resignation in an effort to eliminate an opponent of the Iran Deal. https://t.co/XDYev8zL0c 11/ https://t.co/qtqvfdL0BG\\nIn April 2017, Breitbart repeated the NSC memo’s frame, alleging the rebirth of the “echo chamber” to smear Trump officials like Seb Gorka (the only official cited by name in the NSC memo, which does so twice). https://t.co/0hwVPeh0AC 12/\\nOn May 16, 2017, Gorka told Sean Hannity that the entire “Resist Movement” inside and outside the government was being coordinated by the “Ben Rhodes/Colin Kahl Nexus.” Watch this starting around 01:43. https://t.co/cp4MC7r8Gd 13/\\nAlong the lines of the memo circulating at the NSC, a June 2017 article in the Free Beacon, citing unnamed senior administration officials, blamed @brhodes &amp; me for orchestrating a vast conspiracy against Trump. Read &amp; digest this insane paragraph 👇. https://t.co/sHc0CB5DrU 14/ https://t.co/agPaEm9sCh\\nAnd, according to FIRE &amp; FURY, “many in the White House believed” @brhodes “was the deep state” (p. 154) and Ben was “Trump’s favorite Obama plotter” (p. 215). 15/ https://t.co/TaUq5wZoXK\\nAll of this gives credence to the claim, made by a source familiar with Black Cube’s operation, that the operation to target me, @brhodes, &amp; our families was done “for Trump.” See @RichardEngel’s reporting here. https://t.co/NUeTkzNNiV 16/\\nFinally, separate and apart from any possible connection to the Black Cube operation, step back and think about what this memo circulating inside the Trump NSC last year represents. 17/\\nThe fact that a memo like this even exists is a scandal. The NSC\\'s role to staff the President &amp; coordinate the interagency on foreign policy—it is NOT the job of the NSC to map and target domestic political opponents or collude with outside allies to do so. 18/\\nScandalous revelations from the Trump White House are so common we become numb to them &amp; often so bananas that folks almost laugh them off. But this is no laughing matter. 19/\\nThe potential weaponization of the NSC to go after domestic opponents represents another dangerous shattering of democratic norms under Trump.\\n 20/\\nI know there is a lot of outrage fatigue and a dizzying volume and velocity of crazy news these days. But this newly uncovered memo is a BIG story and the implications are potentially very worrisome. 21/\\nCongress, the Department of Justice, and journalists must get their hands on the full memo (only 1 page has been made public) and investigate how this enemies list was used and whether the civil liberties of American citizens were violated in the process. 22/22',\n",
       " 'How did the conservatives, especially at National Review see the white south? When not writing paeans to southern traditionalism, they saw it as the basis of a coming conservative majority. A short thread: https://t.co/wOk6bhE8jv\\nSo, did the NR-style conservatives see southern segregationist Dems as conservatives or allies? Yes, I think they did.\\nWhich senators were receiving and subscribing to National Review? In 1960, 7 conservative Congressman and Senators subscribed to NR, two liberals, and two Southerners whose ACA ratings were lower due to party loyalty. https://t.co/hll4Jtz0BM\\nThe NR publisher, Bill Rusher saw the most conservative half of the House and Senate as the best audience for the magazine. This included almost all Republicans and “all of the best Democrats, notably the Southerners” incl Eastland, Stennis, Talmadge and Russell. https://t.co/d1yvfsd0aE\\nStrom Thurmond, in his Democratic days, didn\\'t want to miss an issue. https://t.co/vxHsWRFKcb\\nIn fact, in 1957 NR ran an interview with Richard Russell (D-Ga.) on why he opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. “All human history teaches us that problems of this nature must be solved by evolution and not by revolution,” he said, striking a consciously conservative tone.\\nConservative activists and ideologues harbored the dream of breaking free from Eastern liberal influence in the GOP by forging a Midwestern-Southern coalition, making formal the conservative alliance of the 1930s.\\nFor instance, this argument by conservative William Bradford Huie in the American Mercury in 1951. \"The Northern Democrats hate the South; they are all elected South-haters; while the Northern Republicans...have turned to Southerners as allies against the collectivist threat.\" https://t.co/kgr2BwZn4A\\nOr Isabel Patterson who argued in 1955 in National Review the New Deal \"Reconstruction\" of the North had broken the historic ties between the South and the Democratic Party. Conservative Democrats might ally with hypothetical dissident Republicans she suggested.\\nThis meant NR supported Southern Senators like Harry Byrd. But it also meant winning southern presidential votes (since the national Democratic Party tended liberal) and winning Southern Democratic voters to a newly lily-white Southern GOP.\\nNR\\'s \"chief ideologue,\" Frank Meyer saw Southern Democrats as a key part of the conservative coalition (first 2 photos). Bill Rusher (3rd photo) thought Goldwater running a suicidal campaign was worth it to make a bid for southern whites and therefore shift the GOP right. https://t.co/A490vGsPZR\\nPolitically, National Review\\'s favorite candidate Barry Goldwater, who \"hunted where the ducks were,\" was key to making the GOP attractive to southern whites. His anti-labor and, especially, his pro-states\\' rights views were most attractive alongside his strident anti-communism. https://t.co/wTfqgjv1y8\\nNational Review\\'s editor William F. Buckley asked his friend James J. Kilpatrick, an open segregationist, to report on Goldwater\\'s support in the South in 1963, stressing if \"in good conscience\" he could, non-racial issues. Kilpatrick did. https://t.co/t55BwjRa64\\nThe non-racist basis to Goldwater\\'s southern support is a myth that even contemporary conservatives like Buckley wanted to believe for their own sake. Here Bill Rusher describes southern white support for Goldwater. https://t.co/U3Qe7GHa6L\\nHis argument is quite familiar: it\\'s the Democrats with the racist history, it\\'s the backcountry southern Dems who are racist. Southern *Republicans* are constitutionalists and conservatives. They\\'re suburban and educated, not redneck racists.\\nThis was already conventional wisdom, that the Southern strategy was a legitimate vote-winning move and that the whites they were winning were not the real racists, as this memo by a Republican pol that Rusher drew from shows. https://t.co/ohrObRnvuo\\nIn part it\\'s by conflating upper south support for Ike in the 1950s with deep south support for Goldwater in 1964. But the language of class does a lot of work here: the middle class can\\'t be racist, just the poor. It\\'s an argument NR reversed when talking about liberal cities.\\nIt\\'s possible to find instances of people like William F. Buckley criticizing George Wallace. There\\'s a famous Firing Line episode. And, yes, conservative intellectuals were motivated by many more issues than simply racism.\\nBut as this thread shows and as I write here, the editors at NR were willfully naive about their own and their supporters racist attitudes and eager to interpret and whitewash segregationist voters and principled conservatives. https://t.co/9mFTLXqzr1.\\nLastly, I\\'ve seen a trend lately where people say \"x couldn\\'t be a conservative, they were a Democrat.\" Not only is this partisan blindness, but it totally flattens history, projecting back a modern understanding of partisan identity and right and left to the past.\\nJohn Eastland was not a progressive by any understanding of the word.  Conservatives insistence on interpreting left/right as about the size of government and assuming progressive/conservative maps easily onto this is a mistake, as I try and unravel here  https://t.co/UseCIrIRDC.\\nAnd where was Goldwater in all this? https://t.co/kTisz0vN9h',\n",
       " 'The @UN #InternationalYouthDay Was made memorable by credible ranking officers of the @PoliceNG from the AIG, SARS Commissioner, Technical Adviser to the IG, Force PRO, PPRO Zone2, SARS Commanders &amp; our host @koredebello, Speakers @zeal_a @yemusan1 #SafeSpaces4Youth #WhyEndSARS https://t.co/QBKVF5cYJX\\nThanking @knowyourright99 also for his delightful opening speech and @citizen_gavel @NelsonJide for making there despite the heavy schedule and travel time. What could we have done without the backing of @MAVINRECORDS and the great talents at #Caspertainment? Appreciate U Casper!\\nThe AIG said in his speech that not everyone is 100% healthy &amp; we can not say that based on that, we should End everyone’s life. In as much as this is true, we MUST appreciate that we can not treat the dead, neither can the sick approach a hospital renowned for killing patients.\\nTo intellectually understand the simplified campaign in its original construct as an idealistic movement, we must explore various studies (i.e. JonathanHaidt’s “Righteous Minds”), our moral sentiments are strongly related to feelings of empathy in the face of harm and unfairness.\\nThus, it is easier to mobilize against injustice than for Justice. This is typical in Nigeria. If we have started the campaign with #ReformPoliceNG nobody will take us seriously. The same way no one understood the meaning or essence of restructuring till tomorrow. It is vague.\\nWe have grown accustomed to enthusiastically fighting the bad (or perceived bad in most cases) for instance Police killings (EndSARS) instead of Police Reforms.\\nWe are more willing to fight Hunger &amp; Poverty instead of fighting for the kind of Growth &amp; Development that makes Food &amp; sustainable livelihoods plentiful. So when we focus so much about fighting the bad we lose sight of what constitute the Good &amp; how to unleash it. #WhyEndSARS\\nSometimes switching from the “bad” to the corresponding “good” is simply a matter of semantics: to fight against racism is to fight for nondiscrimination. So by  #EndSARS we’re inadvertently demanding the effective, immediate &amp; holistic PoliceReform, while ending the impunity.\\nSo we are in no way attacking the bad to create the good but simply doing good to force the bad to change. This was why we have refused to politicize the advocacy of weaponization se it against any Govt, political party or individual. We have also shunned shenanigans &amp; propaganda\\nOur focus was on setting a pace and creating a template that would sustainably cure other ailments in our respective institutions. The bad is often caused by the absence of the good. The good likewise refer to a Capable State, the ideal, which is not an utopian state of mind.\\nA bureaucracy that can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activity, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all. #WhyEndSARS\\nSo we have the attention of the authorities (Executive, Legislative and Judiciary) and most importantly the Police hierarchy and the dialogue has commenced. This is the second official dialogue as it coincides with the agreement on Security Sector Reforms at Interior @abellodam https://t.co/AhFULBYDtF\\nIt is the absence of a capable state that causes corruption (the inability to prevent public officials, often in collusion with other members of society, from subverting decision-making for private gain), as well as poverty and backwardness.\\nSome might argue that reducing corruption entails the creation of a capable state; the good is created out of the fight against the bad. But this is a fallacy.\\nTeachers and nurses often do not show up for work, but that does not mean that performance would improve much if they did. Policemen may stop asking for bribes, but that will not make them any better at catching criminals and preventing crime.\\nCurtailing side-payments does not imply the ability to manage concession contracts or collect taxes. Those that are in NASS believe a new Bill may be the answer but is it always about more legislation?\\nAside from prosecuting some bad apples, measures to fight corruption typically involve reforming procurement rules, public financial management systems, and anti-corruption legislation. The underlying assumption is that the new rules, unlike the previous rules, will be enforced.\\nThat has not been Uganda’s experience. In 2009, under pressure from the aid community, the government enacted what was billed at the time as the best anti-corruption legislation in the world; and yet all corruption indicators have continued to worsen.\\nUganda is not an exception, same is happening in Nigeria since 2015 change of Government, with an anti corruption themed political party.\\nSo this is just to paint a picture of the multilayered and dynamic angles through which we need to channel our energies to ensure we are not fixated in the approach to building our nation. It will require a lot of inputs from the public and not just those in the system.\\nThe next Police Recruitment will be monitored surgically. We need enlightened hands and good heads on the right shoulders forthwith. No more political recommendations and back door hires. Nigeria belongs to all of us. #WhyEndSARS #LetsKeepTalking\\nWe are now focusing our energy on #ReformPoliceNG (Doing the Good...shining our Light instead of fighting the bad. We now have the attention of each and every entity that matters. It is time to build &amp; not further tear down). @citizen_gavel https://t.co/4Cw9QmBZzQ',\n",

Many people don\\'t know how to spell \"library.\" It\\'s in our email address. This causes problems\\n3. A disturbing number of young people don\\'t actually know how book-lending at the library works. They assume it costs money! Teach your children about libraries!\\n4. Crime and thriller are basically the same thing in many cases. In fact, we have doubles of books because of that.\\n5. People use hidden codes like asterisks to mark which books they\\'ve read. Please don\\'t do that! The system will let you know if you\\'ve already borrowed something! Just ask.\\n6. If an automatic door breaks, people will walk into it instead of reading the sign at face height.\\n7. Libraries are a godsend for blind and deaf people and not just for audiobooks. They can come for help with filling out forms and getting directions.\\n8. Some elderly people go through books at a TERRIFYING rate. They are to be feared and respected.\\n9. Some people are so afraid of computers that they will come to you with a query and then become upset if you offer to look it up on the computer instead of in a book.\\n10. Some people have never, ever used a telephone. Especially older women. Their husband did it for them.\\n11. The DWP fuck over everyone but especially the most vulnerable and I haven\\'t met a single library worker who hasn\\'t helped struggling library users with food or phone calls or even a cup of tea when it\\'s cold and they can\\'t afford heating.\\n12. The Jobcentre regularly lie to people and like to tell them they can get services at libraries that simply do not exist. We will try our very best to help you get what you should have been given at the Jobcentre.\\n13. Most banks assume that everyone has an email now. In fact, some people have trouble proving that they exist at all without one.\\n14. Library folk are good folk. We do this because we are passionate about it. We have to be.\\n15. Libraries aren\\'t quiet anymore. They\\'re community hubs now. They may have quiet study areas but most libraries are bustling with activity. Between kids\\' classes, singing and memory groups for those with Dementia, craft sessions and noisy office equipment, don\\'t expect silence\\n16. Libraries remain the only place where you can spend hours in a publicly-accessible building without being expected to spend money. Parents come to entertain their children for free on wet days. People in poverty come for a warm place to sit. Libraries are a haven.\\n17. Some people will go their entire lives only reading 2-3 authors but still have enough material to read a book every month. (See also: Danielle Steel, James Patterson, Clive Cussler, etc.)\\n18. A library lives and dies by the staff on the counter. You can have the best funding, all of the books and tech in the world but you\\'ll only get footfall if your staff go above and beyond. Sometimes even that doesn\\'t work, though and it\\'s frustrating.\\n19. We\\'re funded based on footfall.

My manager bought a new laminator when we couldn\\'t afford one. She buys in colouring materials for kids. We sometimes bring in our own stationery. We even but lightbulbs in.\\n22. Authors don\\'t like to visit little libraries because they don\\'t get paid. Bookstores often pay.\\n23. The \"sexy librarian\" trope has actually done a LOT of harm and has caused countless incidences of sexual assault by men who can\\'t tell the difference between porn and reality.\\n24. Old ladies keep libraries in business. Old ladies who read are the best. Old ladies who can tell you exactly which page features the most gruesome murder scene are the very best.\\n25. Library staff ALWAYS want to know what you thought of the book. We want to know what to recommend to others!\\n26.

I don't have the capacity to also go to #BlackHat2018 and #BSidesLV so will sadly be missing those :(\\nWith that said though, @BSidesLV is one of my favs and I've never been to Black hat. I've been to #defcon for 10 years straight.

I highly recommend taking some time to look at the schedule of events and picking a few each day. Leave yourself time to relax and recoup from the non-stop house music, loud casino machines, people, and smoke.\\nPersonally, I like to spend my free time making new friends, meeting other women in the industry, checking out the lock picking and wifi villages and wandering.

They should NOT say your room number out loud. If they do, ask them to give you a new room and not say it out loud. This is in case of eavesdropping.\\n-do not leave valuables in your room. Bring a comfortable carry all bag to walk around the con with. You'll thank me when you buy something in the vendor hall and they don't have shopping bags.. (Hak5 does offer shopping bags this year!)\\n-check and double check your hotel and restaurant bills. It's really easy for someone to charge something to your room or table, especially if they know your name. Much worse if they know your room #. It's also easy for a restaurant or hotel to double charge.\\nCasinos have rules for a reason, please follow them, especially in light of the tragedy at Mandalay Bay.\\n-masks on the casino floor are not permitted.\\n-underage drinking is not permitted\\n-weapoms are not permitted\\nEtc etc. Don't give the hotel/casino reason to have bias.\\nPersonal safety:\\nBe aware of the people around you. The only time I have been victimized at a con was in the presence of someone I thought was a good aquaintance. If you don't feel safe, report, gather evidence, do whatever you need to do to feel safe. Read the code of conduct.\\nAwareness: when unlocking your phone, hide your pin/phrase/gesture, whatever.

       " 'THREAD: What does today\\'s news that Manafort\\'s attorneys briefed Trump\\'s attorneys about what he told Mueller after he agreed to cooperate tell us?\\n1/ Today @nytimes reported that Manafort\\'s lawyer repeatedly briefed Trump\\'s lawyers about Manafort\\'s discussions with Mueller *after* Manafort had already begun to cooperate. This arrangement is extremely unusual and highly questionable. https://t.co/tA5ohrGTtI\\n2/ Before a defendant pleads guilty, his interests typically align with other people who are under investigation. In this investigation, before Manafort pleaded guilty, his interests were roughly aligned with Trump\\'s because both of them are under investigation.\\n3/ Once Manafort pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, his interests shifted. Typically cooperators / flippers are viewed as part of the prosecution team. They are trying to help the prosecution by providing information and potential testimony.\\n4/ It is common for attorneys representing subjects of an investigation to enter into what is called a \"joint defense agreement.\" That is a way that lawyers for different people under investigation agree to exchange information and keep that information privileged.\\n5/ That agreement works because of something called the \"common interest\" doctrine, which says that when two people have a common interest in a legal matter, they can exchange information about that matter and keep it privileged.\\n6/ Those agreements are routine in complex white collar criminal cases, and I often enter into those agreements with other attorneys when I represent people under investigation. (And when I was a federal prosecutor, white collar defense attorneys usually had those agreements.)\\n7/ A common provision of those agreements, whether they\\'re written or not, is that the person is required to notify everyone else that is part of the agreement if their client agrees to cooperate with the government, because that ends the common interest.\\n8/ Once someone flips, as Manafort did, his interests are against everyone else under investigation because the prosecutors will require him to cooperate against everyone else and tell them everything he knows. So communications from other subjects to him aren\\'t privileged.\\n9/ In this case, after Manafort flipped, Mueller\\'s team rightfully believed that their conversations with him wouldn\\'t be shared with other people under investigation. Manafort\\'s decision to do so was highly deceptive and undermined Mueller\\'s investigation.\\n10/ By reporting to Trump what Mueller was asking about, Manafort was hurting Mueller, not helping him--even though he agreed to assist Mueller under the agreement. By any standard, what Manafort and his attorney did was deceptive and highly improper.\\n11/ Earlier today during our recording of the #OnTopic podcast, @JoyceWhiteVance said she would view communications with Trump\\'s team as a breach of the agreement. (The episode will be out tomorrow--Wednesday.) I agree. But as I told her, I would go further if I was Mueller.\\n12/ Because Manafort had agreed to cooperate with Mueller, his attorney\\'s communications with Trump\\'s team were no longer privileged because they do not share a common interest. Mueller should seek to discover the communications between Manafort\\'s attorney and Trump\\'s attorneys.\\n13/ That would be very tricky to do, because those attorneys would resist, and putting them in this situation could disqualify them from representing their clients because they may have disclosed client confidences, which means their clients might have a claim against them.\\n14/ The mere threat of taking this action would usually dissuade any lawyer from continuing to engage in this activity. But it\\'s already happened. So what can be done now? While the attorneys did something highly unusual and likely unethical, it\\'s generally not a crime.\\n15/ On its own, this could just be considered highly questionable judgment. But if this is part of a pattern of activity, you could imagine this being part of a larger obstruction of justice case being made by Mueller. It is another active attempt to undermine his investigation.\\n16/ I have participated in many investigations, both when I was a federal prosecutor and now as a defense attorney, and I\\'ve never heard of something like this happening. If true, Trump\\'s attorneys are willing to take huge risks because they think they can get away with it.\\n17/ Some of you are asking, in responses to this thread, how they can get away with doing this. For one thing, it\\'s very possible that none of them wrote down the conversations they had with each other, and all of them would resist efforts to discover what they told each other.\\n18/ If Mueller pursued them, it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt exactly what they said. Trump and his allies could bring political pressure and call Mueller\\'s tactics aggressive, which they would be--they would be a response to highly aggressive tactics.\\n19/ Trump could always pardon his attorneys, although that could come at a political cost. So what comes of this? Mueller\\'s team could detail all of this to the judge who will sentence Manafort. She is obligated to consider the \"history and characteristics\" of Manafort.\\n20/ She is also obligated to consider the \"nature and circumstances\" of his offense. Mueller could also try to find out what the attorneys told each other--merely trying to do that would have consequences. He could also include this activity as part of this obstruction case.\\n21/ Given DOJ guidance that a sitting president can\\'t be indicted, any conclusion that Trump obstructed justice would likely not take the form of an indictment. But the efforts to obstruct the investigation via Manafort could be part of Mueller\\'s conclusion on the topic. /end',\n",
       " 'I\\'m going to hang a thread referring to global warming around this tweet. Come along if you like. https://t.co/t97aWSje4s\\n2. It\\'s a rare day that a tweet like this doesn\\'t show up on my TL. This one showed up this morning.\\nDifferent animals, different places, all one story: save the endangered &lt;focus victim&gt;.\\n3. There are a few species which are endangered specifically by increasing temperatures, but only a few. The polar bear is one charismatic example.\\nThe Florida panther\\'s threat is not temperature related. It\\'s plain ol\\' habitat destruction, the always and forever big one.\\n4. We know a few things about extinction. For one thing, we know it\\'s a one way trip. They don\\'t come back.\\nFor another thing, we know that it is currently running at about 1000 x the historic rate. For every one species we would have lost in a functioning ecosystem, we lose 1000\\n4. The way life works is, for every possible place to live and source of food, at least one creature will evolve to live in that place and eat that food from that source.\\nWe call that a \"niche.\"\\nWhen the last weed patch of one certain type is paved over, some species goes extinct\\n5. Certain special, large, glorious animals become extinct because humans patiently, steadily, kill every last one. That\\'s what happened to the Passenger Pigeon, which used to darken the skies for hours at a time.\\nImagine watching a flock of birds that blocked the sun,\\n6. Flying overhead for an hour, blocking the sun the whole time.\\nImagine the life our fathers saw, and took from us.\\nNow imagine all the life we see, that we are taking from our children and all other humans forever and ever Amen.\\n7. There are many people today who strongly believe that it is morally wrong to kill an animal and eat it.\\n8. I have literally never heard one single person take the stand that it is morally wrong to drive the cars that kill millions upon millions of animals and leave their rotting corpses dotted up and down the highways and byways.\\n\"I like my car.\"\\n\"Cars are useful.\"\\n\"We have to...\"\\n9. If you\\'re old, like I am, you may remember when a road trip on a summer night would leave your windshield nearly opaque with the corpses of bugs.\\nIt doesn\\'t happen like that any more.\\nEven the bugs are dying off.\\nThey are the foundation of the food chain.\\n10. Everything either eats bugs, or eats things that eat bugs, or eats things that bugs pollinate.\\nI\\'m not saying that sweeping billions upon billions of bugs out of the air, smashed on millions upon millions of windshields, made them die off. We invented poisons just for that.\\n11. But all those billions of smashed bug windshield paint were abruptly, like never before in all of time, extracted from the ecosystem, their ecological purpose unfulfilled. Their bodies didn\\'t even fall to the ground to be eaten.\\nNothing exists alone. There is only one whole.\\n11. I was in a conversation with some friends the other day about the usefulness of possums. Possums eat ticks.\\nPossums are probably the number one spring roadkill species. They\\'re slow. When frightened they stop.\\n❌\\n12. We talk quite a bit about global warming, the process by which thermal energy is continually captured by carbon compounds in the atmosphere, particularly CO² and methane. Many people - all the good ones - are concerned, and worry about adding more carbon.\\n13. There are numerous discussions and plans for reducing the emissions of industrial carbon in the atmosphere.\\nNo real action, you understand. Emissions go up every year, especially in the US and China, but... Talk. Chin music.\\nIt\\'s the first step.\\n14. Are you one of the people who retweets pleas to save the Florida Panther, or the Keys Deer, or the Red Wolf, or the Orangutan?\\nCutting carbon emissions is guaranteed to not help.\\nWeeping for the creature is guaranteed to not help.\\n15. Almost for sure, solar panel farms and wind power farms are guaranteed to make it worse. Whole chunks of ecosystem will be modified to suit the needs of solar panels and wind turbines, and whatever lived in the unmodified ecosystem will, by definition, not live in the new one\\n16. Building enough lithium batteries to power a fleet of cars and trucks to replace the current fossil fueled fleet will destroy whole new ecosystems that have so far survived petroleum extraction and refining, survived the paving over of millions of acres of once living soil.\\n17. Either we care about the rest of life or we don\\'t.\\nEither we need a certain minimum of other life to maintain an Earth that can support us or we don\\'t.\\nBut pretending that worrying about \"global warming\" and \"carbon\" will reduce or alleviate the extinction event we have made\\n18. is, at the very most generous, not realistic.\\nThe day there are no more road-killed possums in Missouri will be the day there are no more possums in Missouri.\\nAnd since we starved all the songbirds that used to eat the ticks, when we killed off all the bugs they also ate,\\n19 and the ticks are getting nature\\'s revenge on oh-so-clever humanity, maybe we oughta keep the possums, at least.\\nOur industrial lives are killing our only planet. And it\\'s not \"where we live,\" it\\'s our bodies too. Ourselves. \\nAnd it\\'s making us crazy.\\n20. I am asking the world to me and think the unthinkable.\\nPark all the cars.\\nPark all the planes.\\nCreate a society we can walk to.\\nPrior to 200 years ago it\\'s the only kind there had ever been. We weren\\'t warming the globe or driving it into extinction.\\nNow we are.\\n--jeff out',\n",

       " 'BREAKING! THREAD: Many of you may have heard of Dennis Montgomery. He is a CIA whistleblower who created \"The Hammer\"(HAMR). There has been much reporting, mainstream and otherwise, about Dennis. I have also covered his story in detail on my channel for the past several years.\\nHe first went public via a real estate tycoon named Tim Blixeth. The conversation that he had with Sheriff Joe Arpaio was recorded and then originally released through soundcloud by \"The American Report\". Link to their uploads: https://t.co/D6KN29HuQr\\nPlease listen to the audio above and also please listen to these videos that I have done on Dennis Montgomery: https://t.co/PH7AcfU6xM and https://t.co/NuR2GG5jlq\\nMontgomery tells a story of completely rogue intelligence agencies spying on every American under the guise of security. Montgomery says he was instructed directly by Brennan and Clapper to penetrate and spy on private corporations and American citizens (cont)\\n(cont) even replacing voter information in Florida. It was also revealed via Montgomery that President Trump (along with MANY others) were being illegally spied upon as far back as 2012 and earlier. There has been MUCH written about him, both positive and negative (cont)\\n(cont) in the years since he has come forward. Dennis Montgomery filed DOZENS of whistleblower complaints over the years, and NONE of them were acknowledged. He says he just wanted to get the information about the illegality out so that something could be done about it.\\nHe was ignored by Obama. Many have attacked his credibility and written hit pieces on him. You can find the NY Times doing that here: https://t.co/5kZBNqghG7 I will leave it up to you to do some more due diligence on Mr. Montgomery and come to your own conclusions.\\nWhat can not be ignored is that he was, in fact, in the positions he claimed he was in. And this was more clear when in December of 2015 he met with the FBI under an immunity agreement, and handed over all of the information he had that proved his claims to the FBI and Jim Comey\\nHe met specifically with James Baker, and he was actually questioned about this when Baker went in front of the House committee. Please see Meadows questions: (bulk of information of page 100) )https://t.co/FofZt8getr https://t.co/xzf9xRy0KY\\nMotgomery has alleged publicly, via his former attorney Larry Klayman, that the CIA and Brennan and Clapper were electronically spying on Supreme Court judges, and even FISA court judges and members of congress.\\nThis shouldn\\'t come as a surprise to you, as this has been admitted. https://t.co/eHqYjfSL7g\\nSo, after all of this, imagine my surprise when several months ago I received an email from Dennis Montgomery, who I had been covering for years. I made the rules very clear- do not send me ANY information that is classified or holds any classification whatsoever,\\nHe has been sending me links to articles, and some stories of some of the things he was tasked with doing while a contractor with the CIA. Sarah Carter and John Solomon briefly covered his story and then it sort of just fizzled away. They appeared on Hannity to talk about it\\nhttps://t.co/3v2RncLRX6\\nAs an open source journalist, I don\\'t work with sources. When I get correspondence, I usually respectfully decline, and forward the source along to other reporters I trust. I did that with Dennis, but he continued to email me. I kept reading.\\nTonight, he sent me a story that I really wanted to share with everyone. I am just going to throw it up here. I can not confirm it with open source data, and he did not share any hard proof with me. I want to be open and transparent about that.\\nI can only say this- the Obama administration CERTAINLY was not scandal free. And for all of the outrage the media directs at President Trump for calling the Fake News the enemy of the people? What I am about to share with you was directed at the media FROM the Obama admin.\\nHere are two print screens of an email I received that I am sharing unedited other than to redact email addresses. This email is from Dennis Montgomery, the man who designed \"The Hammer\". I got permission from him to share this with all of you: https://t.co/VoShYpNxOm\\nFor those who didn\\'t read that, Montgomery sent me an email that said \"We breached the NYT network servers in FBI/CIA/NSA domestic surveillance programs I worked in more than once collecting information on their management and employees including reporters...\" (cont)\\n...\"I produced reporters notes and rough drafts ofthe reporters work prior to them releasing their main story to the FBI as part of my immunity agreement. This information was verified by the FBI. The FBI confirmed the data I produced on August 2015, and I testified..\"(cont)\\n(cont) \"to this during my December 2015 meeting with the DOJ and FBI when I was under oath during my video taped interview at the DC FBI headquarters, which I received immunity for\"...\\nAgain, this is coming straight from Dennis Montgomery, but I felt it important enough to share with all of you. I am an open source journalist. This is the very first time I am reporting on source information. Note how I am providing you with the sources full name and info.\\nThere has been much said about the credibility of Dennis Montgomery. To date no one has proven him to be lying about anything he has alleged. I wanted to be transparent here, and I have been. But, IMO? This is a pretty terrifying admission about what our IC is doing to Americans',\n",

Political activity is illegal under the Income Tax Act, but @gmbutts and @JustinTrudeau suspended all CRA audits for eco extremists.\\n5. But they\\'re not just charities conducting illegal politics. They\\'re foreign agents, too. For example, both cash cheques from the San Francisco-based anti-oilsands extremist foundation called the Tides Foundation: https://t.co/t5t037mCwB\\n6. On that same list you\\'ll find World Wildlife Fund, where @gmbutts was prez; Sierra Club, where Zoe Caron, chief of staff to @SohiAmarjeet was prez; and Pembina, where @MarloRaynolds, chief of staff to @cathmckenna was prez. Trudeau\\'s whole team was on the same foreign payroll.\\n7. So Justin Trudeau\\'s own principal secretary, and the chiefs of staff to the energy and environment ministers, were all on the payroll of the same US anti-oil lobby group that just sunk the Trans Mountain pipeline.\\n\\nThis is a great victory that they have worked for, for years.\\n8. Here\\'s Gerald Butts, Trudeau\\'s chaperone, mentor and strategist, a few years back saying he is against all oil pipelines. Not because of any particular route. He just opposes oil pipelines, and the entire oil economy: https://t.co/DNrYPOes7C\\n9. It wasn\\'t just the Tides Foundation. Dozens of U.S. and European foundations poured money into Canada to attack our oilsands and pipelines. Here\\'s the 2008 campaign plan by the New York-based @RockBrosFund. Look at their Canadian front groups: https://t.co/Sq2GDO4Hbm https://t.co/HoghCciceT\\n10. Leaf through that document, verified by @Pembina as authentic. Gerald Butts, Marlo Raynolds, Zoe Caron -- Trudeau\\'s senior staff -- were on the @RockBrosFund payroll with the mission of destroying Canadian oil. Do you think they stopped their crusade when they came to power?\\n11. When I ran https://t.co/rnRunfG26N, we filed complaints with @CanRevAgency about this illegal conduct -- breaking the Income Tax Act. All of Trudeau\\'s crooked allies were audited, and several were on the verge of losing their tax status: https://t.co/d1G76jvR4a\\n12. It was patently obvious Trudeau\\'s friends were cheating the system. Read one of our meticulously researched complaints for yourself here: https://t.co/BtMV5uKMUB\\n13. When Trudeau took over, he installed people from these law-breaking organizations into his highest offices. Then he ordered the professional, civil servants, the non-partisan auditors at @CanRevAgency, to stop enforcing the law against his friends: https://t.co/WUowPgTn7j\\n14. Are you shocked that I would use words like \"cheat\" and \"corrupt\"? Don\\'t be. Trudeau is the first sitting prime minister to be convicted of breaking the law. He illegally took a free, $100,000+ gift, and then tried to cover it up. https://t.co/lIKWbuees2\\n15. I forgot to point out perhaps the nuttiest part of the ruling: block the pipeline, because there are some killer whales in the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. See paragraph 68: https://t.co/edxZMIRm7v https://t.co/rY1NDlAxym\\n16. According to the Port of Vancouver, 3,160 ships come and go each year, an that\\'s climbing steadily. They\\'re not a problem, apparently. But ONE MORE SHIP PER DAY -- which is what the pipeline would add -- is an ecological crisis. Port stats: https://t.co/wyXgNNZuff\\n17. Why are thousands of leaky, rusty Chinese ships carrying their imports to Vancouver considered whale friendly; but state of the art, double-hulled tankers are not? Well, because Trudeau\\'s lobbyists don\\'t care about Chinese ships or OPEC oil -- they only lobby against Canada.\\n18. But look at that wording again: the pipeline is being blocked because of the threat to \"Aboriginal culture uses\" of killer whales. What does that mean? What is a \"cultural use\" of a killer whale, that only Aboriginal people can do? They can\\'t hunt them. It\\'s made up. https://t.co/DL9sosgvhe\\n19. So these three extremist judges say 3,160 Chinese freighters are fine, but one Canadian oil tanker a day is a threat; they say Aboriginals, including those hundreds of miles inland, have special \"cultural uses\" for whales. They\\'re very concerned. But what about B.C.\\'s sewage?\\n20. Like the super-gross city of Montreal, Victoria dumps its raw sewage into the ocean. Where those precious killer whales are. Every day, Victoria treats the sea like a garbage dump. But that\\'s OK, you see. That doesn\\'t interfere with \"cultural use\": https://t.co/u5dxGTsow1\\n21. Last point: well over $100,000,000 has flooded in to Canadian politics from foreign anti-oil lobbyists, including into the 2015 election, through \"third party\" campaign groups. Some even registered with @ElectionsCan_E with their US mailing addresses! https://t.co/E9oPOzfpTj\\n22. Most of it has gone to the NGOs that @gmbutts coordinated. And: total silence from the Media Party. Not one word. Compare that to the freak-out that CBC had when the NRA merely looked at Canada -- didn\\'t spend a dime, just looked: https://t.co/927FjfUvK0\\n23. Whenever Harper or a Conservative would meet a Republican, it was front page news, \"US-style politics!\" Whenever Trudeau or Butts would meet a Democrat -- or even have senior Democrats running and funding their campaign -- it was just called impressive and worldly by the CBC.',\n",

I remembered: Christoper Steele who would be hired by Fusion GPS many years later to publish Trump-Russia Dossier passed his findings to Mother Jones October 2016\\n6. You really think that it is mere coincidence that Fusion GPS and Mother Jones’ paths seem to fortuitously cross at the “right moment” ?

Turns out Katsyv’s lawyer was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was not licensed to practice in the US. So, Katsyv hired the law firm of BakerHostetler to represent Prevezon; BakerHostetler hired FUSION GPS in 2014 to provide research help for the litigation…..\\n11.

       " 'Long before #MeToo became the catalyst for a women\\'s movement about sexual assault — and a decade before the fall of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and U.S. Olympic gymnastic doctor Larry Nassar — there was Jeffrey Edward Epstein. \\n\\n#PerversionofJustice https://t.co/z3rIvzQWE9\\nMultimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein was accused of sexually assaulting dozens of teen girls. Their stories were dismissed by prosecutors, who cut Epstein a lenient deal. His victims have never had a voice, until now.\\n\\nPart 1 of #PerversionofJustice: https://t.co/Rdg8AkvaDO\\n\"I don\\'t think anyone has been told the truth about what Jeffrey Epstein did,\" said Michelle Licata, now 30. \"He ruined my life and a lot of girls\\' lives. People need to know what he did and why he wasn\\'t prosecuted so it never happens again.\" https://t.co/RCWvKdqYGX\\nWhat he did, according to interviews with victims and police, was lure girls, aged 13 to 16, to his mansion for a \"massage.\" He would molest them, paying extra for oral sex and intercourse, and offering more money to bring him new girls, like an underage sex pyramid scheme. https://t.co/cVAjM5zGDn\\nThe evidence police collected to support the victims\\' stories was impressive. \"We had victims who didn\\'t know each other, never met each other and they all basically told the same story.\"\\nEpstein could have spent life in prison, but he only served a little more than a year in jail. Why? A secret deal was struck — an extraordinary plea arrangement — with help from future Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta. https://t.co/OFzvjGZJm0\\nDocuments show Acosta, then a federal prosecutor, didn\\'t just buckle under pressure from Epstein\\'s lawyers; he and other prosecutors worked *with* them to contain the case — even as the FBI was uncovering evidence of a wider sex trafficking operation.\\nThe secretive deal allowed Epstein to quietly plead guilty to two felony prostitution charges. He admitted to committing only one offense against one underage girl, who was labeled a prostitute, even though she was just 14.\\n\"She was was taken advantage of twice — first by Epstein, and then by the criminal justice system that labeled a 14-year-old girl as a prostitute,\" said the girl\\'s lawyer.\\nThe pact Epstein negotiated with federal prosecutors was sealed so that no one — not even his victims — could know the full scope of his crimes. Court records, letters and emails show that the deal was negotiated, signed and executed behind victims\\' backs.\\nTwo police officers were willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein. They said they felt pressured by the state attorney to drop the investigation and downgrade it to a misdemeanor. https://t.co/u5nd8mTabV\\nBut they continued their work, finding evidence that supported the girls\\' allegations: Phone calls and messages like, \"Tanya can\\'t come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice,\" and naked photographs of girls in Epstein\\'s closet. https://t.co/AtE7BY9lHE\\n\"I always hoped that the plea would be thrown out and that these teenage girls, who were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, would get to finally shed that label and see him go to prison where he belongs,\" said one detective.\\nThat detective died in May.\\n\\n#PerversionofJustice Part 2: https://t.co/x8K1CTnypW\\nOn the morning of his sentencing, none of Epstein\\'s victims were in the courtroom — and that was by design. The victims couldn\\'t voice their objections or possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the plea agreement altogether.\\nOne victim, Courtney Wild, who was 14 when she met Epstein, is suing the federal government, alleging that prosecutors kept victims in the dark as part of a conspiracy to give Epstein one of the most lenient deals for a serial child sex abuser in history. https://t.co/p9odz1Jm0K\\nOnce behind bars, #JeffreyEpstein didn\\'t go to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida. He didn’t even spend much time in his cell.\\nHe was allowed to leave for work release six days a week. His year of \"house arrest\" included trips to New York and the Virgin Islands. \\n\\nPart 3 of #PerversionofJustice: https://t.co/lsynvA1rPr\\nToday, ongoing litigation could reveal more about #JeffreyEpstein\\'s crimes and who was involved. A lawsuit is set for trial Dec. 4 in Palm Beach County.\\nAs with every case involving Epstein, this one could further embarrass his once-impressive roster of A-list friends and associations, which included Bill Clinton, President Trump and Prince Andrew.\\n\\nA guide to Epstein\\'s inner circle: https://t.co/E8dgNLZcy5\\nSeveral women who went to Epstein\\'s home as underage girls are scheduled to testify against him for the first time. \\n\\n\"These guys will get it in the end because us girls are not gonna sit here and just let this keep happening.\" https://t.co/EeRNSOPblx\\n.@jkbjournalist analyzed thousands of court records, lawsuits, witness depositions and FBI documents, filing motions in federal court and submitting FOIA requests.

       " \"Thread \\n180 years of excuses. Jews get murdered and always they make exuses. Just this week @BBCTwo get told by an Arab the Jews are the target &amp; #BBC covers it up. Elsewhere @RashidaTlaib distorts history. All to hide the real cause of the conflict - Arab violence against Jews.\\nDuring the Second Intifada - media &amp; politicians were adamant total desperation was the reason Arab terrorists killed Jews in suicide attacks. Yet the 2 bombers at Mike's Place were British , how were they more desperate that you or I? Let us look closer at these excuses- https://t.co/BRVdr1Pbzd\\n2019 &amp; Israeli civilians are murdered as 100s of rockets are fired at Israel. This as violent riots on Gaza's border are painted as peaceful by the media. The excuse? Gaza is a pressure cooker. Logically, if you remove the pressure the killing stops. So let's check that shall we? https://t.co/4TEjd4qH9w\\nIt is February 7 2019. Ori Ansbacher is raped &amp; murdered. Full details of the brutal killing are withheld. The terrorist explicitly said he entered Israel with a knife to kill a Jew. The BBC didn't make up excuses - or mistranslate - they didn't even bother to report it. https://t.co/gNbOW8iJKm\\nIn October 2015 - the 'knife intifada' was in full swing. We were told then that the reason Arabs were murdering innocent Jews was because the ‘status quo’ on the Temple Mount was being threatened. If that is true - then let us step back a year. https://t.co/6zwGVcuSc2\\nIt is 2014. The status quo on the Temple Mount is not being threatened. There's an attack by a 16-year-old terrorist who stabs Jews at a supermarket in Mishor Adumim. Western media say it was because of frustration from the Gaza conflict. If this is true, let us go further back. https://t.co/qNNVx7tudr\\nMarch 2004. There's no seige on Gaza. No pressure cooker. 2 Gaza terrorists kill 10 Israelis in Ashdod. The reason? Gaza is occupied. So Israel withdrew from Gaza, dismantled settlements &amp; what happened? They received Hamas rockets in return - but anyway, let us look further back https://t.co/uMzgGGRYZJ\\nOct 2000, Gaza conflicts are a decade away. Vadim Nurzhitz &amp; Yossi Avrahami ‘had their eyes gouged out &amp; were disembowelled’ by an Arab lynch mob. The given excuse for the violence of the second Intifada was Ariel Sharon's foot on Temple Mount. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/6d1bskaFtM\\nSept 1999. Ariel Sharon's foot has not yet gone to Temple Mount. Sharon Steinmetz &amp; Yehiel Finfeter were stabbed. The Arab said he murdered them 'because they were Jews', the media had none of it. They blamed the stagnation of the peace process. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/Cyt04c6Pw4\\nIt's late 1993 and the stagnation of the peace process is yet to be seen. 'Hope' is now the keyword. Yigal Vaknin was stabbed to death in an orchard. Hamas took responsibility. Media and politicians said they just did it to stop the peace process. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/SSLin2NaOf\\nMarch 1989. The Oslo Peace Process has not begun. An Arab worker in Tel Aviv stabs Israeli civilians on the Jewish holiday of Purim. Western press blame frustration at the occupation &amp; settlements for the violence of the first Intifada. If that is the case let us go further back. https://t.co/HuFBspOhq6\\nIt is March 9, 1978. A decade before the intifada. Terrorists hijack a bus carrying families on an outing. 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children, were killed. The excuse? Terrorists killed the Jews to stop peace talks with Egypt. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/8JWbKVnyiZ\\nIt is 1966. There is no 'occupation' and no settlements. The Arabs massacre Jews on trains, buses &amp; attack Jewish farmers. Western media placed the blame for the violence on frustration at the refugees created during the War of 1948. If that is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/imYr8yIhrm\\nDecember 2nd 1947. There are no refugees, no occupation. Israel doesn't exist. It is 3 days after @UN voted for Partition. Arabs riot in Jerusalem. 8 Jews are killed. Western media says this is just an Arab reaction to partition. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/lEecmimTdC\\nNov 1941. No refugees, occupation, Israel or partition. Arab leader Haj Amin al-Husseini meets Hitler. He helped form Muslim Waffen SS units and prevent 10000s of Jews escaping. Western media don't make excuses for this, they just ignore it. Which means we must look further back https://t.co/E88IfMOoqx\\nIt is April 1936. The start of the Arab revolt. By the end of the first week, 17 Jews were murdered. Media place the blame for the violence on opposition to Jewish immigration that was caused by Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.  If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/aFghguVVUJ\\nAugust 1929. There is no partition, no Israel &amp; no refugees. Abraham Mizrachi is stabbed to death - within days-  there are massacres of Jews in Jerusalem Hebron &amp; Tzfat. The excuse? The threat Arabs felt a Jewish presence brought. If this is the case, let us go even further back https://t.co/zT3MoLWebS\\nIt is 1920. There is no partition, no Israel, no refugees &amp;,little immigration. The Neba Musa festival. Jerusalem Riots had Arabs murdering Jews again. This time the excuse was disappointment at the non-fulfilment of independence. If this is the case, let's go even further back. https://t.co/BhKMPBXv4h\\n1910. We have left British Palestine, because it does not yet exist. There's no promise of independence, no Balfour &amp; no Mandate. Ariel Sharon's foot has not yet been born. We are in Shiraz for a massacre of Jews. The excuse? A blood libel. Let us look further back https://t.co/DTSv7wtQyc\\nWe travel before the modern Zionist movement began. To the Ottoman Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. The British are flooded with request from Jews to protect them. There are pogroms in Jerusalem in 1870 &amp; 1895 and in Jaffa in 1876. The excuse long forgotten. Let us look further back. https://t.co/EWGqBcoJXz\\nIt is 1834. Six years before the murder of innocent Jews in the Damascus blood libel. A pogrom occurs in Tzfat. Jews are killed and raped and homes and synagogues are destroyed. Other pogroms take place in the ME. In places like Aleppo, Beirut, Cairo, Mansura &amp; Alexandria https://t.co/DLidTkrJ8Z\\nBefore partition, before Israel, before settlements, before refugees, before Sharon, before the ‘wall’, before Hamas, before Balfour &amp; before Zionism. In the beginning there was an Arab with a knife and he murdered a Jew simply because he was a Jew. Enough with the excuses https://t.co/StB0gXr21b\\nFor the full story go to the blog. https://t.co/cIuBeLgA8s To support the research on patreon you can go here https://t.co/4lOGdmtMSJ or Paypal here. https://t.co/kPpEOKPEAB\\n\\nThere's too much media distortion.

Unbelievably, children as young as 4 months are taken from their parents, medicine is confiscated, &amp; medical care withheld, and LGBTQ and disabled individuals are held in solitary confinement.\\n\"The Trump administration’s immigration policies and detention camps meet the United Nations\\' definition of genocide and crimes against humanity. \\n\\nCongress is refusing to stop the president and his policies. \\n\\nWe cannot allow these atrocities to be perpetrated in our name.\"\\n(quote @ECMcLaughlin) \\n\\nPerhaps most terrifying, refugees are beginning to be moved onto military grounds, where there will be a complete lack of oversight from the media, lawyers, &amp; human rights monitors. Many of us thought we would never see anything like this in modern times.\\n“Now is the time for every person to stand up and say, ‘We will not accept this!’ No more hesitating. No more denial. No more fear. We need to be bold, and loud, and unrelenting. That’s the only way we can stop this,” said @KristinMinkDC.\\nLights for Liberty seeks to create this event in solidarity and allyship with communities most impacted by the abuse of our immigration system.\\nWe seek to work in solidarity with grassroots organizations both new and historic, those who are well-funded and on shoe-string budget. We are moved to mobilize with anyone: moms, dads, and people of moral conscience who cannot stand to see families and communities destroyed.\\nSimply put, our country is at a tipping point.\\n\\nEVENT DETAILS:\\n\\nOn July 12th, Lights for Liberty will shine a light on the horrific abuses of the Trump administration in human detention camps. People will begin arriving at 7pm local time at locations around the nation.\\nAt five main locations, legislators, activists, and organizers\\nwill speak until 9pm. \\n\\nAt 9 pm local time, at every detention camp (there are 200+ and at least one in every state), and in cities, towns, and homes around America, a silent sea of candles will light up the nation.\\nEl Paso, TX, where migrants are being housed in outdoor conditions under a bridge with no running water for months at a time, is the anticipated site of the main Lights for Liberty vigil. Legislators, activists, organizers, &amp; members of impacted communities are expected to speak.\\nOther key events are planned in: \\n\\nHomestead, FL, at a migrant child detention facility that has caused mass abuse and neglect; \\n\\nSan Diego, near the point of entry site from Tijuana;\\nin New York City, at Foley Square, where hundreds of migrants are processed through detention a day; \\n\\nand in Washington, DC, in front of the Capitol building, to demand action from Congress to end human detention and impeach the President.\\nDetails of exact vigil locations will be announced in the coming days.\\n\\nWe welcome all individuals and organizations who support an end to human detention camps to participate in a main or local event.\\nPlease email us at contact@lightsforliberty.org if you or your organization is interested in sponsoring or supporting an event in your area.\\nThese events are being funded entirely out of the pockets of our organizing team. We have no sponsors and will not be asking for any financial contribution for these events.\\nWe will invite the public to directly contribute to organizations supporting migrant refugees on our donations page of our website.\\nThis moment has the opportunity to be a turning point in our nation’s history, a moment in which we bring these camps out of the shadows, stop America’s rapid slide into unspeakable horror, and demand that our country stand up for the values it strives to uphold.\\nWe invite you to stand beside us on the right side of history on July 12th.\\n\\nFor more information please visit our website: https://t.co/hROv6uvKF7\\nAnd in the interim, from now until the end of this administration and its horrific policies, we invite you to light a candle in our window to keep vigil for all those still held in Trump\\'s detention camps, and all those persecuted, marginalized and harmed by this administration.',\n",

       " '(THREAD) BREAKING: In a stunning development in the Trump-Russia investigation, former top Trump aide Sam Nunberg says he will defy a Mueller subpoena, thereby risking incarceration. I discuss the context and implications of this development here. \\n\\nHope you\\'ll read on and share. https://t.co/IYubC1NeUe\\n1/ Nunberg has become a well-known figure in the Trump-Russia saga due to him acknowledging that he\\'s intentionally lied to the media in the past—requiring journalists to issue caveats whenever they cite him—and saying Don Jr. told his dad about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.\\n2/ The importance of this second point can\\'t be overstated—as Nunberg is the second top Trump aide (with Bannon) to publicly express certainty Don Jr. told his dad of the campaign\\'s secret meeting with Kremlin agents at Trump Tower on or around the time it happened. This matters.\\n3/ If Trump knew of the Trump Tower meeting with Kremlin agents at the time it happened, Trump may be responsible for a series of federal offenses relating to how he worked to cover up the nature of the meeting afterward and his knowledge of Russian ambitions/actions post-June.\\n4/ More importantly, Sam Nunberg just said on MSNBC that he believes \"Trump may have done something [illegal]\" during the presidential campaign, but he doesn\\'t know what yet. He bases his opinion on interactions with the Trump campaign after he and Roger Stone were fired from it.\\n5/ Nunberg met with Mueller a week ago, and it\\'s clearly that meeting that led to Mueller issuing a subpoena for any and all emails between Nunberg and certain Trump aides—basically, any Trump-Russia figure you could think of, including the president himself—since November 2015.\\n6/ Nunberg told MSNBC his meeting with Mueller focused on whether he (Nunberg) heard discussions of Trump Tower Moscow plans during the presidential campaign, and/or whether he saw any signs that Trump was developing U.S.-Russia policy on the basis of his ongoing business deals.\\n7/ During the course of his interview with MSNBC, Nunberg revealed that he did think that Trump was constantly aware throughout the presidential campaign of how his policies could affect his business—as he didn\\'t expect to win. I and others have been saying this for many months.\\n8/ Nunberg also said Mueller wants him to testify for a grand jury Friday to incriminate Trump advisor/confidant Roger Stone, who I wrote days ago—see below—can now be indicted at a time of Mueller\\'s choosing for lying to Congress. Looks like I was correct.https://t.co/IcT6bxWAxJ\\n9/ Nunberg is a Stone mentee, and his reasons for not wanting to cooperate with Mueller\\'s subpoena are clearly pretextual—meaning, he\\'s suddenly realized that while he can *say* what he wants to Mueller, his *emails* may, if he\\'s compelled to produce them, tell a different story.\\n10/ Why do I say his excuses are pretextual? A week ago he told MSNBC the Mueller probe *isn\\'t* a \"witch hunt,\" and now that he\\'s being asked to produce his correspondence on the question, he suddenly says that it *is* a \"witch hunt.\" So clearly he has something he wants to hide.\\n11/ Why else do I say his excuses are pretextual? Because he\\'s disregarding his attorney\\'s advice. (He says his lawyer is likely to \"fire\" him.) Why else? Because his main reason for not complying—he says—is *it\\'d take too long to find all the emails requested*.\\n\\nYes, seriously.\\n12/ Why else do I say Nunberg is refusing to produce documents for clandestine reasons? Because he\\'s not just objecting to producing emails that could hurt Stone or be professionally embarrassing—he\\'s *also* saying him having to produce emails to the president is \"over the line.\"\\n13/ So Nunberg is worried about his emails to Stone, and also, apparently, worried about his emails to and from Donald Trump—a man he now admits he believes \"did something wrong [illegal]\" during the 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps his emails reflect that knowledge or belief?\\n14/ There\\'s more—and it\\'s also stunning. Nunberg has perhaps inadvertently given us a view into exactly *what* he thinks Trump may have done wrong, as he told MSNBC repeatedly (and he brought this up voluntarily) that it\\'d be \"fine\" if Trump wanted Russia to release Clinton dirt.\\n15/ To be clear, it would *not* be fine.\\n\\nIt would likely be Conspiracy to Commit Computer Crimes or Aiding and Abetting Computer Crimes or some sort of Bribery charge if Trump communicated directly or indirectly with the Russians about releasing their *stolen* Clinton materials.\\n16/ Take all Nunberg said and a scenario emerges: Nunberg said Trump knew of the June 2016 meeting because subsequent correspondence with the president or someone else confirmed to Nunberg that Trump knew of it and—after—tried to secretly facilitate Russia releasing Clinton dirt.\\n17/ Nunberg, in this view, is refusing to comply not just because he doesn\\'t want to hurt Stone—though that may be so—or because complying with the subpoena could hurt him (though that may be so), but because he thinks his emails may lead toward the discovery of some larger plot.\\n18/ In his interview with MSNBC, Nunberg took the disconcerting tack of implying that he will be, he hopes, just \"the first\" of many former Trump aides to decide that the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and they shouldn\\'t comply with it. That is dangerous, lawless rhetoric.\\n19/ Yet Nunberg is unsophisticated enough that he \"doesn\\'t think [Mueller] will do anything\" if he refuses to comply with a federal subpoena (spoiler—he will) and publicly says Carter Page colluded with the Russians—see below—so who knows what his deal is. https://t.co/XQ0dp8e50g\\n20/ The upshot: Nunberg will produce these emails or be held in Contempt and go to jail. He has no valid legal defense against production and—with each word he says—underscores why Mueller wants this evidence: because it *could* reveal a smoking gun. Per—it seems—*Nunberg*. {end}\\nPS/ No one thread can capture how strange these events are. For instance, at one point Nunberg tells MSNBC his proof no one is tampering with him is that he looked at \"no emails\" before deciding not to comply with Mueller\\'s subpoena. Minutes later, he says \"I reviewed my emails.\"\\nPS2/ I\\'ve represented enough defendants to recognize BS intended to cover a crime, so it was clear to me days after we learned of the June \\'16 Trump Tower meeting—where top Trump aides met Kremlin agents—that Trump knew of it. Do Nunberg\\'s emails prove it? https://t.co/iPxobfFsCM\\nPS3/ Was excited to hear John Harwood (NBC) use the phrase \"collusion in plain sight\" to describe Trump\\'s public remarks encouraging Russia to release Clinton dirt. The \"collusion in plain sight\" theory (quid pro quo by private/public statements) is one I put forward a year ago.',\n",

       " 'Thank you, as always, @KevinMKruse. An appended thread, if you don\\'t mind.\\n \\nFirst, @DineshDSouza, let\\'s make clear the eugenics behind the 1924 Immigration Act. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/nXCwcCl29K https://t.co/pOyUAfcmDb\\n2) The public focus on the 1924 Immigration Act revolved around its anti-Asian measures, the portion of the law known as the Asian Exclusion Act. It forbade all further immigration from Japan, China, and every other Asian nation. https://t.co/7Gj1bISEJ9\\n3) It was the culmination of a long anti-Japanese campaign fomented in large part on the Pacific Coast. And in particular, it was fomented by a man named Miller Freeman. Freeman was a publisher and land developer, and was the father of modern-day Bellevue, WA. https://t.co/ngaNhn7TUm\\n4) Beginning in about 1910, Freeman -- a GOP legislator and indeed one of the state\\'s most powerful Republicans -- began a campaign aimed at driving Japanese immigrants from the state, and Japanese fishermen from U.S. waters. It reached a fever pitch in 1919. https://t.co/tbGfFk8dxk\\n5) Albert Johnson, who hailed from the relative backwater of Hoquiam, was a protege of Freeman\\'s, and the two had a voluminous correspondence, which can be found in the Freeman archives at the University of Washington. I\\'ve read through these letters and many others.\\n6) Johnson, like Freeman, believed in the eugenics propaganda that was one of the popular subjects of the time. In particular, both had read \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White Supremacy\" and believed they were acting to prevent its predictions. https://t.co/sD3qzh26QL\\n7) This was a common thing among Washington Republicans, who made great hay agitating against Japanese immigration during this period. Various officeholders, especially rural legislators, found that piously talking about saving American civilization went over well with voters.\\n8) Gov. Louis F. Hart, a Republican, campaigned for his ultimately successful re-election on a promise to outlaw the leasing of any property by the Issei. https://t.co/aQKEk9lAPu\\n9)  One of Hart\\'s 1920 GOP primary opponents, John Stringer, took it a step further: “It is our duty to take every acre of land on Puget Sound away from the Japs and place it in the hands of our ex-soldiers.”\\n10) When the legislature convened early in 1921, a flood of anti-Japanese bills awaited. The first proposal would have made it mandatory to post American citizens as guards at any Japanese-owned hotel. Another called for an official investigation of the Japanese immigrants.\\n11) All these faltered in the legislative process. But the centerpiece bill—a land law that forbade ownership of land by all “aliens ineligible for citizenship,” and making it a criminal offense to sell or lease land to any such alien—flew through both houses unimpeded.\\n12) Flush with political victory, Miller Freeman had the final say on the matter. In an article addressed to the Japanese community, he minced no words: “The people of this country never invited you here. You came into this country of your own responsibility ...\\n13) \" .... large numbers after our citizens supposed that Japanese immigration had been suppressed. You came notwithstanding you knew you were not welcome. You have created an abnormal situation in our midst for which you are to blame.\"\\n14) In 1924, Albert Johnson, then chair of the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee, introduced a bill that would limit immigration to a 2 percent quota for each nationality, but prohibiting the admission of any “aliens ineligible for citizenship” -- i.e., Asians.\\n15) This was predicated in large part on a 1922 Supreme Court ruling, Ozawa v. United States, which ruled that people from Asian nations could be excluded from citizenship and naturalization.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/ErVSG2q2Br https://t.co/kfYnDAtpbN\\n16) Johnson\\'s racial attitudes were well known. He was the head of \\'The Eugenics Research Association\\', a group which opposed interracial marriage and supported forced sterilization of the mentally disabled. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/wRb1JC9kew\\n17) He believed in other components of eugenics, including its anti-Semitism. In support of his 1919 proposal to suspend immigration he included a quote from a State Department Official referring to Jewish people as \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\"\\n18) Johnson\\'s measure handily passed the House, but was amended in the Senate to allow for a quota from Japan. However, at the last moment, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge weighed in, claiming that a warning from the Japanese ambassador constituted a \"threat.\" The House version won. https://t.co/z0JTKywvLa\\n19) In Japan, the public had been closely watching the passage of the alien land laws with mounting outrage. And when news of the passage of the Asian Exclusion Act was announced, mass protests broke out in Tokyo and other cities. https://t.co/0YBfuKELTg\\n20) As Pearl Buck would later observe, the then-nascent movement for American-style democracy, which had been slowly gaining momentum in Japan, was effectively wiped out overnight. The military authoritarians who would control the nation for the next 20 years gained mastery.\\n21) Of course, one of the cornerstones of their rule was a bellicose anti-Americanism that would finally reach fruition in late 1941. https://t.co/hvb21qA4nF\\n22) Moreover, the groundwork laid by the success of the nativist campaign led to one of the nation\\'s great historical atrocities -- namely, the incarceration of 110,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. https://t.co/nqpVZh3z9l\\n23) All along the Pacific Coast, many of the men leading this campaign -- beginning in 1910, and continuing all the way up through 1942, when congressional hearings on the coast featured public testimony demanding removal of the Japanese -- were Republicans like Miller Freeman. https://t.co/SyDejEhYDX\\n24) One final note: The campaign described above in Washington state was replicated elsewhere on the Coast; both California and Oregon passed Alien Land Laws, and their congressional delegations joined in support of the Johnson-Reed Act. As always, both Rs and Ds participated.',\n",
       " '1. A few thoughts on Trump\\'s dinner in honor of evangelicals, which I\\'ll be discussing with @RickSmithShow later. Key context to consider is that fascism is concerned with defining who belongs to \"the nation\" or \"the people,\" and who doesn\\'t. Internal enemies (Others) are needed.\\n2. This dovetails neatly with the way in which fundamentalist believers police who does and does not count as a member of their religious confession. This is critical to understanding the Christian Right\\'s politics of \"religious freedom\":\\n\\nhttps://t.co/eyUgHlIICH\\n3. Indeed, as I have written elsewhere, \"Fundamentalism is authoritarianism in microcosm, or on the margins. Fascism is essentially fundamentalism in power.\" The vast majority of white evangelicals are authoritarian and fundamentalist.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/qZhVTc2QmK\\n\\n#EmptyThePews\\n4. One thing we can take away from the remarks Trump made while \"honoring\" radical evangelicals last night is that he still speaks their language very poorly, but their support for him has never been about him being one of them. It\\'s about power, control, advancing their agenda.\\n4-a. From a religious studies perspective, this absolutely does not make them \"fake Christians,\" and that framing is an unhelpful, usually defensive, deflection that detracts from formulating effective responses to Christofascism.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/weB1ftcusX\\n\\n#Exvangelical #Resist\\n5. Here is the transcript of the remarks Trump made last night. He names a number of the guests, all hardline evangelicals (including token minorities like Ben Carson) who have shilled for him. This is part of a pattern.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/n7cYs70rCG\\n\\n#TuesdayThoughts #EmptyThePews\\n6. While previous presidential administrations have made efforts (to varying degrees) to reach out to religious leaders inclusively, Trump gives conservative, mostly white evangelicals an unprecedented degree of access that is exclusive. As his base, to him, they are the nation.\\n7. Here\\'s an example of this pattern. Remember Trump\\'s Middle East trip? Guess what \"news\" organization got exclusive access to him to cover it? Why, none other than the Christian Broadcasting Network of Pat Robertson infamy!\\n\\nhttps://t.co/OaIEo4vvxl\\n\\n#EmptyThePews #Resist\\n8. Thus, when Trump speaks of \"religious liberty,\" he is speaking of giving evangelicals free rein, including to discriminate against others. That\\'s also their definition of \"religious freedom.\" Others don\\'t count. This is Christofascism, and it is in power. \\n\\n#EmptyThePews https://t.co/9DCLURdczW\\n8-a. Conservative Catholics are also on board with this agenda, of course. They pursue the same politics, but Trump has been especially cozy with evangelicals.\\n9. You can call conservative evangelicals out as hypocritical, if you want. But that accomplishes little more than preaching to the choir, so to speak. Hypocrisy, such as we\\'ve seen in Catholic abuse coverups, is integral to authoritarian systems.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/cA3NdhkGct\\n10. Christofascists are not going to be won over. I thus see the most effective means of opposing them as follows. The end goal must be to get them out of power. The means to that end, apart from the ballot box, is to delegitimize them in the eyes of the wider American public.\\n11. This means working to reframe our national conversation on religion, particularly about evangelicalism. We must get the press to at least quote ex-evangelicals, scholars, researchers who argue that today\\'s evangelicalism (and any fundamentalism) is incompatible with democracy\\n12. This is a hard sell in a country whose chattering classes exhibit a knee-jerk impulse to be deferential to any large (and well-heeled) Christian group. Researchers like @brucewilson and @FredClarkson who have been warning us about dominionism for years have faced ridicule.\\n13. We have, however, made some progress in changing public discourse on religion. A good part of that progress comes from the few evangelicals of conscience, and particularly from ex-evangelicals (or exvangelicals, or exvies), who have begun to be heard:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/zhn9wyWGNK\\n14. Journalists like @PaulHRosenberg, @ninaburleigh, @sarahposner, @SarahBurris, @NotoriousTIB, and others have begun to consider the #Exvangelical community to be stakeholders in discussions of evangelicalism. And that is critical to effectively opposing Christofascism.\\n15. #Exvangelical hashtag campaigns, like #ChurchToo (started by @hannahpaasch and @emilyjoypoetry) and #EmptyThePews (which I started) have gotten news coverage. That\\'s a good sign. We need more of it.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/xO5oAYHfCB\\n16. The #Exvangelical community is also working to hold more offline events, such as an upcoming roundtable and public discussion in Tampa, FL. Join us there on September 8 if you can make it! National media will covere the event. Exvie novelist @JosiahMHesse will be present. https://t.co/qQh8TtklxH\\n16-a. We needed crowdfunding to pull off the Tampa roundtable, The Exvangelical Community: Paths, Projects, Prospects, and you all came through. Thank you for that!\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Oz2YAJMzxU\\n17. If you want to help us change the national conversation around evangelicalism and toxic Christianity in ways that will help to delegitimize the Christian Right, one of the best things everyone can do is simply to listen to and promote #Exvangelical voices.\\n18. Suggestions for exvies to follow #OnHere: @ToriGlass, @brchastain, @cindy_w_brandt, @anaisbelieve, @jonjones, @theKevinGarcia_, @charlotteirene8, @dwell_in_tents, @Lorisadventure, @Lily_Warrior, @KEBrightbill, @julieingersoll, @WheelerWorkshop, @gloriousbeth, @SbethCaplin\\n19. To get back to the WH  dinner honoring evangelicals for their contributions to American society, a response that came from the #Exvangelical community was precisely highlight #EvangelicalContributions... in a way that is highly unflattering to evangelicals.

PT2\\nI went along to their base of Operations in Scotland to give a free Consultation to this Individual as I am a K9 Behavior Specialist so I knew of this K9 well enough to talk more about his problems he was dealing with. In our convo he told me his plans to move back to Wales! PT3\\nHe had moved back from Scotland and his plans had all failed on him, no where to live, no where to look after \"Chewie\". I instantly sent him £200 to his paypal via his Streams Donation page. I told him this was not to be repaid and to make sure he gets himself kept safe! PT4\\nAs he had not been paid yet I wanted to make sure he was safe as I had a good relationship with him from Streaming. I had said to him if he needed me to watch \"Chewie\" I would come for her to make sure he was less stressed out as one could be in this situation. PT5\\nHe then contacted me on the 7th April. He asked if I could watch \"Chewie\" for him. I instantly said yes. I do a lot of K9s it\\'s my job end of the day. As we talked it would work out I would be driving 18+ hours to collect her. I asked if half way by train was a option. PT6\\nHe agreed and I sent him the Train Fare of £200 along with another £300 to live. Plan meet in Glasgow (Scotland) it was going to be still a 8 hour trip for me. We met and was taken to my Car. We then headed back North with my two Wolves. She was very stressed and so was a I. PT7\\nI had taken time off Streaming to do this for him. I then took off the next day of Streaming to start the training process. I mean if she was going to be staying with me, might as well give her a full course of Training for nothing right? She started off well. PT8\\nI contacted him to find out Vet Details as I was offering to have her have K9 MOT and get fully boosters at my Local Vet. I never got a reply to the details, so she never got these needed boosters. Which I found strange but as she isn\\'t my K9 I never pushed for the info. PT9\\nShe was also very skinny so I started bulking her up to bring her back into normal weight area of a K9. I got her a special feeding bowl and explained what I was doing but I never got any hint that 2FUCKS were being given. No questions no asking about the K9 at all. PT10\\nShe was very poorly trained and I was noticing some special need symptoms. We went to work with her but sadly she managed to get her self on the bad side of my two Wolves. This was the start of some major problems. I was having to do double work. PT11\\nDouble work? It was meaning I had to walk 4x a day as they couldn\\'t be beside each other. Meant double training to do as I keep training my two. So I started to feel this Physically and Mentally. I was also doing fitness to lose weight a personal goal of mine and Streaming. PT12\\nI was also having to deal with having the Garden done and having a K9 (Mothers Dog) going through a serious operation so the timing was all wrong. Not his fault just adding this in to show everything from the get go was stressful on our side! PT13\\nI contacted him saying I was giving him a Cut Off time of the 19th May another 4 weeks from this point. I\\'m already stressed but nothing compared to being Homeless and Jobless. So I pushed on. I kept updating him but still ZEROFUCKS given. Never any MSGs asking how she was. PT14\\nWe are now at the 6th of May and I made a Phone Call to him to make sure he was prepped to come Collect her from me, was even going to offer I would drive her some distance to make it easier. NOTHING no reply, no phone back, zero answering so at this stage my heart sank! PT15\\nThis point I talked around to see if people had spoken to him, they did. That\\'s when I went FUCK I am going to be landed with this K9. So the past two weeks I have been really ill with Stress. Streaming, Physically &amp; Mentally tired but kept pushing forward for the K9. PT16\\nWell the 19th came, no collection, no phone call, never answering me via Phone/SMS/Discord, nothing... and this brings us to the WORST feeling I have had to deal with today. PT17\\nSo as someone who loves and works with K9s going to this next place is a heart breaking thing for me. Never have I had to go there, I don\\'t like people taking animals to these places as there is always a way out of it. So today I had to take \"Chewie\" to a Rescue home! PT18\\nI am a older man, I don\\'t cry at most things, people dying, animals dying and so forth. But I have been very emotional for the past few hours as I have never heard anything so horrible as \"Chewie\" Screaming like \"Help Me, Michael\" when they took her from me. PT19\\nIf it wasn\\'t for the fact she never got on with my two Wolves I would have gladly adopted her. But feeding 4 dogs, boosters and all is too much for me right now. As I am purely Streaming right now, I have no income, everything I do earn goes back into the Stream! My choice. PT20\\nI\\'m not looking for money back, I\\'m not looking for the time back. However I\\'m deeply disappointed in how someone like this could not only treat their Dog to abandoning it but how he has treated me when all I did was try to help him! I\\'m deeply broken today! PT21\\nNow why am I posting this on Twitter? Well firstly I wanted people to know my side of the story, I have not included names or linking people because well you can work it out for yourself. My story is written, it\\'s a good life lesson that some humans still prove TRASH to me! PT22\\nNow I am not saying unfollow, unsub this Individual, your old enough to make your own mind up. But just THINK before you support this person! If someone can abandon their K9, they will fuck you over for less. I have unfriended this person! PT23\\nI could never forgive this kind of behavior. It\\'s childish, its a cowardly way because all it would take was to talk to me and we could have sorted it like Adults. I\\'m sorry for the Rant Tweets but again I had to get this off my chest and vent! P24\\nI won\\'t be talking to anyone today, not in the mood, an emotional wreck right now. I will however be trying to Stream on Tues but will let you all know if I need to cancel. Thank you for reading this, REPLY/RT if you want, forgive me if I don\\'t reply back. END!',\n",
       " 'Oh hey.  Sorry for the delay.  Not on twitter all the time, Congressman.  This may take a while and I know how busy you must be but let\\'s start with substance then move to process. Shall we? 1/ https://t.co/SUwGMdH43t\\nOn substance, I think you know the answer.  And if you listened to the one person who is your colleague and who actually knows the border (and is from your party), you would understand why the dynamics of border security are fluid and require a layered, not static, response. 2/\\nThat would be Will Hurd so just read this first.  https://t.co/Wz0kLrBBA6\\nIf viewing better than reading, how about this:\\nhttps://t.co/bckDsvHkQh 3/\\nSo, why would anyone who lives, works or actually spent a career (I think you know my bio by now. . . ) in homeland security and border management not favor a wall?  The alternatives -- man/women power, technology, barriers (yes, lest you forget, the Obama Administration built\\nnearly 800 miles of barriers, drones, dogs, etc. -- are so much better.  See unlike a war zone (I\\'ll defer to you on that), a port of entry must permit flow.  It is how we function as a market economy. So us \"experts\" think about it in terms of how do we better \"secure flow\" 5/\\nbuild a wall.  So let\\'s take your example of the fentanyl arrest.  Think about it: it was stopped because it wasn\\'t a wall.  It was intelligence, man/women power, technology and DOGS that led to the arrest.  That\\'s how it should work; it\\'s not a sign that there is a better 6/\\nalternative with a static solution.  So I suspect you get this but I\"m happy to explain.  On process, though, you are the congressman.  And you know that your job is to weigh priorities with funding.  7/\\nSo let\\'s assume you have 100 pennies to spend across competing priorities.  And so let\\'s say you want ALL of them to be spent on border enforcement (not sure how your constituencies would feel about that).   8/\\nHow would you spend them? No one, not even CBP until last few months, ever even thought a wall made sense because it would take years (tell me how that solves a crisis, but as you know there isn\\'t one), require eminent domain (your Texas colleagues have thoughts on that), and 9/\\nwould pull from the dynamic security that does work.  So that us \"experts\" oppose the wall is just an unbecoming comment.  Us experts include your Republican colleagues and those of us who have worked border issues in government.  And, again, CBP.  10/\\nAnyway, I feel silly writing this. You know this and if you don\\'t happy to continue the conversation but one final thing.   . . about that mansplaining thing. 11/\\nI wasn\\'t going to re-engage it.  I don\\'t want to be know as the \"expert\" who accused you of mansplaining any more than you want to be known for an SNL skit.  It\\'s not why we do what we do; it\\'s personal and I took to heart what you said in response to the SNL skit. Civility. 12/\\nAnd as a graduate of Harvard, your odd mentions of it in every tweet to me (this is the first time I have mentioned it) suggests its a dig. I\\'m sorry you feel that way about what you may or may not have learned here. We try to teach responsible bipartisan leadership.  13/\\nSome of us have spent a career in and out of government, or media, or private sector, and the academy (she is me).  But I would take your interest in my opinions more seriously if they didn\\'t include such odd personal attacks.  14/\\nIt\\'s not becoming of your position.  \\nI wish you best as you assess this and your role.  And you engage with women and men whom you disagree with in a much less personal manner.  I believe the facts, history, economics and policy are against building a wall. You don\\'t. 15/\\nSupport your point with facts, history, economics and policy.  Not with mocking a woman.  Because, well, she is me.  And you will lose that one.  16/16\\nHi. So I\\'m back online and thanks for all these responses.  I was rushed when I wrote this so I think I\\'m allowed to continue because in the responses it occurred to me that the basic tenets of security were relatively new to folks and I\"ll try to arm you all with what I know 17/\\nto help in this debate. So back to substance.  Earlier I mentioned how we want fluid responses to support the (sometimes competing) goal of \"secure flow.\" It\\'s how we think about movement in our homeland.  (I\\'ll leave the moral and legal issues about a wall to others). 18/\\nBut there is also a second tenet for how we think about complex security challenges: layered security.  The basic goal here is to ensure that you don\\'t build a system around, what we call, a \"single point of failure.\" 19/\\nA \"single point of failure\" is to be avoided at all costs because if it is penetrated, then the whole system goes down.  9/11 and cockpit doors; Sony hack and a single system administrator; BP oil spill and a blowout preventer.  So, ideally we build systems that have multiple 20/\\nbarriers so that the access point is either avoided (i.e. you can\\'t get into a system through cyber attack because the system is layered and bifurcated) or difficult to access (i.e. lock the cockpit door, but have multiple security layers before entry to plane.) 21/\\nSo, on substance, the \"wall\" defeats those two primary tenets of protecting a complex system: balancing security with flow (the border and points of entry) and avoiding the single point of failure (the wall can be overcome by a ladder or tunnel).  22/\\nIt\\'s just a way to think about the substantive arguments about real security.  Moral debates are important; legal ones as well.  But it\\'s important that critics of the wall also have the tools to explain why we aren\\'t \"soft\" on security, but actually take it quite seriously. 23/\\nOk, I think I may have violated some unwritten rule of twitter and threads, but my objection to the wall (even assuming I could get it for free and in a day, which I can\\'t) are not just \"that\\'s not who we are\" or \"immigrants are good for America.\"  24/\\nI\\'m not known for being soft on security, border or otherwise.  And so in the realm of policy options, the wall fails every standard that we have learned in homeland security for the last 20 years.  Now, I say good night. 25/25',\n",
       " '1. THREAD: Did James Comey have the Wikileaks emails in March of 2016?\\n\\nYesterday, @15poundstogo asked an interesting question of @ProfMJCleveland: https://t.co/4qQogOFVZq This was something I had completely forgotten about. Let’s go through some background.\\n2. Back in 2017, Comey had testified, and a NY Times article had reinforced, that James Comey made the decision to announce that the FBI would not be charging Clinton in the email case (cont)\\n3. (cont) , in part because of “Russian intelligence” in the form of emails between the DNC/DOJ and Open Society that proved Lynch was attempting to stifle the case. https://t.co/XmM2rdJuKO https://t.co/kynAFg8mKt\\n4. In this “Russian Intelligence Memo” (Comey states he never saw an email, just intelligence) it states that there was an email between DWS and Leonard Bernardo of Open Society which read that Lynch had been in touch with Renteria (a senior Clinton campaign staffer) (cont)\\n5. (cont)  and told her she wouldn’t let the investigation into Clinton “go too far”. https://t.co/63czX3RU3z https://t.co/Ju5l6CGY8T\\n6. Timeline: James Comey receives “intelligence” from a “source” in March of 2016: https://t.co/gmMtc7QZIv https://t.co/uCYXEY29ZB\\n7. The DNC announced that it had been “hacked” by the “Russians” the week of 6/15/16 and relies on information from it’s “cybersecurity firm” Crowdstrike: https://t.co/a7yKNvJlzE https://t.co/owGLHW5dK4\\n8.  The story makes its way into the MSM in May of 2017. This may all be repeating old and tired news for you. I am about to add a really interesting piece here. This is where the lightbulb went off for me. Enter one @MichaelRCaputo\\n9. On May 22, 2018, Caputo did a spree of interviews that threw me for a massive loop. He began talking about informants who were approaching him throughout the campaign. This one in particular really grabbed my attention.\\n10. Caputo says that in the first week of May, 2016 he was approached by an intermediary, a former government official, who told him they had Clinton related emails at that government organization and they wanted to get to the Trump campaign  https://t.co/Fe92x0Hkd7\\n11. He states that this conversation occurred on May 6th, and would continue for several days. He states that this intermediary is willing to go on the record about these interactions and the facts behind them. He states that staff members of “the agency” (cont)\\n12. (cont) (which he can not name) said they had Clinton related emails which at the time he believes to be the deleted emails.\\n13. After Caputo leaves the campaign in June, the intermediary returns AGAIN, wanting to provide the information. Caputo does not want to take posession of these emails, and so he declines to work with the intermediary.\\n14. When this story broke, there was a big back and forth, with the contractor denying and walking back information- that is a sub story we wont get into here.\\n15. The real kicker comes at the end of the interview with Cavuto. Caputo states, that at the time, the intermediary spoke about the content of some of the emails, and that one of them dealt with a Swedish waiver on Iran that was given at the time $26m was delivered to the CF.\\n16. Caputo was STUNNED when that information was released in a wikileaks Podesta drop in Late October.\\n17. Caputo states he went back to the HPSCI to clarify answers he had already given to the committee about Russians approaching him with emails, and that he shared the details of these encounters with Mueller, the HPSCI, Huber, etc. to no avail- no one wanted to touch it.\\n18. I spoke with Michael Caputo yesterday to hammer down some details of this story and he informed me that his attorney, Dennis Vacco, who is a former US Attorney for the Western District of NY and former NY AG shared the details of this with Durham yesterday.\\n19. Why is this important? Because it lends further confirmation to the fact that the US IC was IN POSSESSION of the “hacked” emails taken from the DNC and Podesta as early as March of 2016.\\n20.  It brings further confirmation to the fact that Comey was in possession of the ACTUAL emails and NOT a “Russian” intelligence document- meaning he likely knew back then what the \"hack\" really was.\\n21. It lends further confirmation that the US IC KNEW that these “hacked” documents would be released, and that a cover of “Russian interference and hacking” was placed on this leak to further perpetuate the narrative.\\n22. It insinuates that Comey knew and had in his posession at least some of the DNC emails before their publication, and I will leave the rest of the possible speculation to you. So to answer the original question? YES. Mueller SHOULD have investigated this.\\n23. To watch the video I did at the time explaining the story and lending more detail, please watch: https://t.co/hnS9U7gTou\\nI want to add to this - I am aware that the last dated email is May 25, 2016. However, this is too compelling to deny the fact that there is a possibility that the IC knew these emails were being taken the entire time, and since it WAS NOT a hack, couldn’t close the leak.\\nOf course, this is speculation on my part, but the corroboration between the stories is so compelling (as I said) that I’m willing to rethink the timeline. I think we have to be willing to rethink k established narratives and timelines. For that reason, my thread will stand',\n",
       " 'STUFF PEOPLE GET WRONG ABOUT ABORIGINAL HISTORY A THREAD\\nNo, we didn\\'t kill any pygmy people. There were no pygmy people here. I feel like that\\'s probably a very offensive term but I see this one doing the rounds quite a lot and it\\'s completely false. We are not the \"second Australians\" who usurped the land from pygmies.\\nWe didn\\'t arrive here four thousand years ago, or even forty thousand years. Every few years they find earlier and older evidence of our occupation here. Count is currently at 65k, significantly older than any living culture. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/sbUUeDRwrj\\nMany Aboriginal people, including myself, don\\'t believe in so called \"migration theories\" and believe that we were created here on this land. We have creation songlines which link many different language groups together with shared ancestral beings.\\nSpeaking of language - we had a lot of them. Around up to 700 dialects from around 250 different language groups. These languages were and are geographically situated and mob would be familiar with/able to communicate in multiple. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/82zVMYSNOw\\nThere is no cultural/spiritual origin for sexual abuse, cannibalism, or infanticide.\\n1788 was an invasion. Phillip had orders from King George to avoid causing harm to local Aboriginal people if at all possible, and was instructed to try to negotiate with locals so as to better acquire land and resources.\\nThere were multiple military expeditions/raids throughout NSW in the decades following invasion. MacArthur gave instructions to soldiers in 1795 to drive away \"the natives\", ie kill them and clear the land. That\\'s what the term \"dispersed\" means in many colonial records.\\nAboriginal people did resist invasion and did organise against settlers, attacking farms, stealing back resources, killing settlers etc. The punishment for these actions was typically far harsher from settlers and regularly involved the killing of women and children.\\nAboriginal people did help settlers on multiple occasions. Sometimes they were rewarded for this with land packets, money, and breast plates. Often enough, as in the case of Galmarra/Jackey Jackey and the Cape York expedition, they rejected these offerings.\\nDisease spread often before settlers. Disease accounts for significant losses even before some communities had ever seen a white person. It is almost certainly true that smallpox was spread willfully through the distribution of infected blankets, as had been done in the US.\\nMissions and reserves were usually terrible and oppressive places for Aboriginal people and many people died of poor sanitation and starvation. Missions = religious control, reserve = welfare/protection board. Aboriginal people typically didn\\'t have freedom of movement.\\nWelfare/protection boards were managed on state authority until 1967 and there was significant inconsistency in policy/practice. Aboriginal people were mostly considered wards of the state under the authority of these boards up until the mid 20th century.\\nBoards had the power to regulate residence, marriage, force unpaid employment, remove children, etc. In late 19thC the movement towards assimilation began and families were separated on the basis of \"blood quantum\", an imprecise science (it wasn\\'t science).\\nSpeaking of remains, stolen Aboriginal remains were being passed around in anthropology classes as late as the 1960s. There are no laws for repatriation of Aboriginal remains in Australia.\\nAustralia did have a slave trade, commonly referred to as Black Birding https://t.co/goruqoaQZZ\\nIn the 20thC after being institutionalised many Aboriginal boys were forced into unpaid manual/station work while girls were forced into unpaid domestic apprenticeships. Protection board knew girls were being raped in these positions but felt it was beneficial for assimilation.\\nLand Rights didn\\'t begin with Mabo, it began with Invasion. There was the handover of land to the Gurindji peoples in 1975 after almost a decade of political organising which preceded Mabo.\\nThe 1967 didn\\'t give us the right to vote or to be citizens, those rights came in gradually in the 20thC depending on state, but voting wasn\\'t encouraged or accessible. 67 gave us the right to be counted in the census, and for the federal gov to make laws regarding us.\\nThe gov has a bad history in its use of these powers, often operating alongside the repeal of the Racial Discrimination Act in cases such as Hindmarsh Bridge and the NT Intervention.\\nWe were never considered flora and fauna. Honestly a lot of the time we had less rights than that. Altho the management of Aboriginal affairs did at one stage come under a flora and fauna portfolio, which is probably where that myth comes from.\\nAboriginal people have been writing for a long time. First western-recognised form of authorship comes in the form of Bennelong\\'s 1796 letter to Lord Sydney\\'s steward. First written petition for land was in 1832 from Maria Lock. First book from David Unaipon in 1928.\\nThis one’s a biggun: YES WE DID HAVE AGRICULTURE! The denial of systems of farming and land cultivation is central to the denial of our rights and sovereignty to the land BUT we totally cultivated the land and still practice things like fire stick farming \\nhttps://t.co/Hh6KtaAHL7\\nTerra nullius was never “declared”, it only appeared in legal usage/documentation in the 20th century. The notion that Aboriginal people didn’t sufficiently fulfil western criteria for land possession was certainly around at invasion but it wasn’t formalised as a doctrine\\nAboriginal is a demonym which means it must be capitalised. The preferred language is humanising - so Aboriginal people vs Aborigines etc. We have over 200ys of being called black and we have reclaimed that language for our use - ie black, blackfellas, Blak (see Destiny Deacon)',\n",

       " 'Thread: A picture is worth a thousand words, and your brain needs billions of neurons to process it. Why do we need so many neurons? To find out, we recorded thousands of them in mouse visual cortex. Here’s some data, and a link to the paper:\\nhttps://t.co/XsrxRsLzS1 https://t.co/fnfySyoEH0\\n2. One reason to have so many neurons may be that they each have different jobs: \\nNeuron A recognizes the pointedness of a fox’s ears,\\nNeuron B recognizes the color of the fox’s fur. \\nNeuron C recognizes a fox nose, \\netc https://t.co/1t5hOn1WKn\\n3. When enough of these neurons activate, the brain as a whole can recognize a fox. https://t.co/ZVk3zPj0YS\\n4. What if some neurons “fall asleep” on the job and don’t respond to the image? This actually happens very often, and yet the brain is remarkably robust to these failures.\\n5. Even if 90% of the neurons don’t do their job, we can still recognize the fox. Even if we randomly change 90% of the pixels, we can still recognize the fox. The brain is robust to a lot of manipulations like that. https://t.co/7oi9bOm9UL\\n6. Artificial neural networks also use millions of neurons to recognize images. https://t.co/sOY5Emm3Qa\\n7. Unlike brains, machines are not so robust to small aberrations. Here is our fox and next to it the same fox very slightly modified and now the machine thinks it’s a puffer fish! https://t.co/Bd9ZDyY7QJ\\n8. These are called “adversarial images”, because we devised them to fool the machine. How does the brain protect against these perturbations and others?\\n9. One protection could be to make many slightly different copies of the neurons that represent foxes. Even if some neurons fall asleep on the job, their copies might still activate.\\n10. However, if the brain used so many neurons for every single image, we would quickly run out of neurons!\\n11. This results in an evolutionary pressure: it’s good to have many neurons do very different jobs so we can recognize lots of objects in images, but it’s also good if they share some responsibilities, so they can pick up the slack when necessary.\\n12. We found evidence for this by investigating the main dimensions of variation in the responses of 10,000 neurons. Below, each column is one neuron’s responses to several of our images. https://t.co/UZqDjTaKv4\\n13. The largest two dimensions were distributed broadly across all neurons, as you see below. Any neuron could contribute to these and pick up the slack if the other neurons did not respond. https://t.co/AtES0KSNR1\\n14. The next 8 dimensions each were smaller and distributed more sparsely across neurons. If a neuron was asleep, it was still likely a few others could represent these dimensions in its place. https://t.co/7Dqnes6lUQ\\n15. The next 30 dimensions revealed ever more intricate structure... https://t.co/v8dZtUJgbp\\n16. And so did the next 160 dimensions... https://t.co/rlEpkoOIMi\\n17. And so on, this kept on going, with the N-th dimension being about N times smaller than the biggest dimension.\\n18. This distribution of activity is called a “power-law”. https://t.co/IiWTda0nwI\\n19. However, this was not just any power-law, it had a special exponent of approx 1. We did some math and showed that a power-law with this exponent must be borderline fractal.\\n20. A fractal is a mathematical object that has structure at many different spatial scales, like the Mandelbrot set below: https://t.co/WTARMWiym4\\n21. This Inceptionism movie is also a kind of fractal: https://t.co/icQEakUayT\\n22. The neural activity was so close to being a fractal, and just barely avoided it because it’s exponent was 1.04, not 1 or smaller.\\n23. An exponent of 1.04 is the sweet spot: as high-dimensional as possible without being a fractal.\\n24. Not being a fractal allows neural responses to be continuous and smooth, which are the minimal protections neurons need so that we don’t confuse a fox with a puffer fish!\\nAll the neural data is available here: https://t.co/5Qr0Ry8rY7\\n\\nAnd the code is here: https://t.co/zGfNMUEy7m',\n",

       " '1. Knowing Trump’s path to the presidency may provide much needed prologue for what is going to happen with the circle of filth and other pressing issues. President Trump didn’t wake up one morning and decide to run. He has planned his ascent to presidency for a long time.\\n2. He does nothing without knowing its eventual consequences, regardless of how it may look on the outside. The first recorded “presidential speech” given by Trump occurred on October 22 1987. Yes its not a typo. https://t.co/Q2SPgT8UF2\\n3. His speech was remarkably similar to what currently says, on that day he said: “I\\'m not here because I\\'m running for President. I\\'m here because I\\'m tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across.\\'\\'\\n4. He was tired of the United States being kicked around by allies like Japan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. These countries had become \\'\\'the world\\'s greatest money machines\\'\\' because the United States paid for their defense. He was 41 years old then  https://t.co/rDL3GllYho\\n5. On Oct 7, 1999 edition of Larry King Live Trump announced announced creation of a presidential exploratory committee. Jesse Ventura persuaded Trump to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party. Trump eventually dropped out, citing party\\'s inability to unite.\\n6. He called Pat Buchanan, another reform party candidate a “Hitler-Lover” in response to Pat’s contention that Hilter presented no serious threat to the United States in WW 2. \\nhttps://t.co/PaJaHgvCyh\\n7. On Jan 1 2000 he released his book “ the America we deserve” he said “I really am convinced we\\'re in danger of sort of terrorist attacks that will make 1993 bombing of WTO look like kids playing with firecrackers\"\\n8.\"A liberal policy of immigration may reflect confidence and generosity. But our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.”\\n9. February 14, 2000, Trump withdrew from race citing infighting in Reform Party knowing he couldn\\'t win both because of its direction and membership, including David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani who he described as Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively.\\n10. Trump wrote an editorial in NYT entitled “What I saw at the revolution”,  he wrote: “I seriously thought that America might be ready for a businessman president, someone with an eye for the bottom line, someone who has created thousands of jobs”\\n11. \"I felt confident that I could sell the American people if I could get into the debate I preferred race against Bush and Gore, two establishment politicians whose nominations looked certain and whose issue positions seemed virtually indistinguishable”\\n12. I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep” “I Saw VP Gore trudging through the snow in subzero temperatures, knocking on doors in New Hampshire, a look of drudgery on his face.\\n13. My experience was quite different. I had enormous fun thinking about a presidential candidacy and count it as one of my great life experiences.” “I cannot rule out another bid for the presidency in 2004.”\\nhttps://t.co/Z9DWm34VB4\\n14. In 2003 Trump began hosting The Apprentice, he thought about a presidential run in 2004, decided not to join the race. During 2012 presidential race, he once again considered running. Few polls even put Trump in second place in the GOP presidential field, behind Mitt Romney.\\n14. He decided not to run saying “I maintain strong conviction that if I were to run, I would be able to win the primary and general election” \"I have spent the past several months unofficially campaigning and recognize that running for public office cannot be done half-heartedly\\n16. Ultimately, however, business is my greatest passion and I am not ready to leave the private sector”\\nhttps://t.co/MrE4nTRRG5\\n17. Most people took these statements as Trump only promoting himself. In retrospect, he did exactly what he said he would, matter of factly, but with Trump braggadocio. Without the benefit of his past, most people discount Trump as too undisciplined and prone to verbal outbursts\\n18. Not many predicted that Trump would ever be the president: however one  curious thing did happen. The Band “Rage agains the machine” in their 2000 video “Sleep now in the fire” show a person holding up a Trump president poster. Go to 1:03 \\nhttps://t.co/P0R3CK165E\\n19. Trump did predict that Brexit would happen \\nhttps://t.co/RV9UAW1V8i\\n20. On 1/26/16 Trump went on a tirade and mentioned Brussels several times during the interview with Maria Bartiromo, On the morning of 22 March 2016, three coordinated suicide bombings occurred in Belgium\\nhttps://t.co/qYat4PVy5H\\n21. Trump does everything with a keen eye on results. His methods are unorthodox, making them difficult to follow or interpret. It is also why people underestimate his abilities. Being underestimated is a superpower very few can lay claim to.\\n22. For those now entertaining doubts about what the future is going to bring, read carefully. I hope that a picture emerges of a man who\\'s always sculpted his future carefully, deliberately &amp; with little regard to what others think about him. Watch his roast on Comedy Central.\\n23. I also like to point out that Trump occasionally will tweet plain and pure facts. Sometimes these facts can seem fantastical in the present but matter of fact when viewed through the benefit of hindsight. I think this is one such example. \\n-Fin \\nhttps://t.co/x1osVasC8f\\n24. PS: Trumps life and career have included The Who\\'s who of Media, Hollywood, Real estate &amp; politics. He not only survived, he thrived in this constantly swirling toilet of depravity &amp; turpitude. He knows how to put pressure on everyones \"trigger points\"\\nhttps://t.co/Hgja2eaPwM\\n25. If you remember my previous thread: I had predicted that this would happen and that the lobotomized Hansel and Gretel of US politics would push for a DACA fix. Well that is exactly what is happening.

       " \"1. Oh, the Democrats are scandalized! They are outraged by the treatment of immigrant kids in concentration camps on the southern border!\\n2. How can this happen? they tell us. How can the United States, land of the free, the home of the brave, treat the poor and the tired and the hungry as if they were political prisoners remanded to the Gulag?\\n3. Well, I’ll tell you. It’s not only because the president and his administration are fascist. To be sure, the Democrats did not launch a “zero tolerance” policy that belies federal law and the human right to asylum.\\n4. No, the Democrats are not building walls. No, the Democrats did not unleash, as Donald Trump did, the closeted Aryans of US Customs and Border Patrol. But the Democrats have done plenty to contribute to this debacle.\\n5. The Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, once believed the Republicans were dealing in good faith when they demanded security in exchange for supporting immigration reform.\\n6. To that end, the Obama administration, with the blessing of congressional Democrats, spent billions and billions to secure the southern border. (This was in keeping with the previous administration’s post-9/11 military buildup.)\\n7. The Obama administration, moreover, deported more people than all presidents combined (up to that point). Sure, the Democrats were splitting up immigrant families but the hope was from pain would come reform, specifically a pathway to citizenship.\\n8. The Republican leadership, however, never intended to work with the administration on immigration reform. To be sure, some “moderates” like US Senators Lindsey Graham and the late John McCain tried and succeeded in crafting deals with Senate Democrats.\\n9. But even they surely knew it didn’t matter what they did. Every time the Senate passed an immigration package, the House killed it.\\n10. Why? By 2013, the Republican base had decided anything short of a border lock-down was dangerously insecure. The party’s base had decided anything smacking of reform smacked of amnesty. These were and are impossible standards, and the Republicans knew it.\\n11. But as long as the Democrats kept thinking they could satisfy those standards, as long as the Democrats kept throwing money at the border while waiting for the right-wing fever to break, the GOP was happy. It took pleasure in its advantage.\\n12. And it continues to, even though it is establishing concentration camps to shelter what can only be called political prisoners, people jailed not for doing something wrong—they have the legal right to seek asylum per law—but for being disliked by the current president.\\n13. None of this would have been possible if the Democratic Party had not accepted for years for the sake of political expediency the Republican Party’s utter and toxic bad faith.\\n14. None of this would have been possible without the billions and billions that went into securing the border over the last two decades.\\n15. Concentration camps and the criminal treatment of innocent kids scandalized the Democrats this week but none of it would have been possible without complicity on the part of the Democrats.\\n16. Borders do not define a nation. Borders reflect a nation, meaning that problems on the border tend to reflect problems elsewhere in the body politic so that the more attention paid to the nation’s borders, the less attention is paid to the nation's real problems.\\n17. Put another way, the Democrats, in playing along with the Republicans, are not only surrendering their political leverage; they are drawing attention away from issues where they have a much stronger hand.\\n18. Imagine if instead of spending billions on “border security,” the Democrats fought instead to deregulate the southern border in the name of openness, free labor and free enterprise.\\n19. Here’s how Manlio Graziano put it in his short book, What Is a Border? He said:\\n20. Each proposed false solution to a real problem only ends up creating new problems. The real problem ... has opened the floodgates to the excessive passion for borders is the shifting of power, that is, the shifting of the economic ... geopolitical axis of the world.\\n21. Graziano: Thinking the problem can be resolved by strengthening borders is like thinking that one can lose weight by breaking the scale. Indeed, it’s much worse: breaking the scale at the most leads to a false good conscience and a few more pounds;\\n22. Graziano: coming up with false solutions to real political problems allows us to have a good conscience for only a bit longer because there will inevitably be new and more serious problems, setting off a dangerous downward spiral.\\n23. The Republicans, in making a fetish of the southern border, have been leading the way in America’s downward spiral, because the party has no good new ideas proportional to the political and economic challenges awaiting us in the 21st century.\\n24. That wouldn’t be so bad if the Democrats weren’t so eager to prove they too stand for security, thus contributing to a false solution to a real problem that’s only making things worse.\\n25. As in the past, the Democrats continue to accept the GOP's bad faith. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/MwwYeGfO5k\",\n",
       " '#Tweetorial time! 🚨 Looks like there’s another misconception about #cholesterol and #atherosclerosis making rounds again. This one has to do with the process of #LDL particles entering the arterial wall. So gather round friends and let me science the s*it out of this 🤓 (1/24) https://t.co/62dcEc6pR8\\nFor background, here’s a widely cited series of figures by Nakashima et al. (2007). They performed autopsies on 38 people aged 7-49, who died of non-#cardiovascular causes (2/24)\\nhttps://t.co/qMSuPNagwC https://t.co/cyiyu6OkYp\\nNakashima et al. looked for atherosclerotic lesions at different stages, according to a previously published morphological classification scheme. They found them, took slices, stained them to find #lipids and #macrophages and organized them nicely (3/24)\\n(It should be noted that even though the famous figure series now looks like it could depict actual progression of a single plaque, individual figures are obviously from different subjects and different lesions at various stages) (4/24)\\nThey present an elegant “time-series” of how lipids first appear in the vessel wall and then progress deeper and deeper eventually pooling into one great big mass. Lipids are followed by macrophages - cells that eat them (5/24)\\nThis is a GREAT illustration of the current paradigm of atherogenesis (“response to retention”), meaning that LDL particles enter the arterial wall, get trapped, aggregate &amp; become inflammatory. NOT some other sequence of events: https://t.co/Q1jL20flKf (6/24)\\nSo here’s the topic of this tweetorial: according to some, there’s something fishy in this series! Let’s look at the first image. Notice how the lipid stains appear quite far from the inner layer of the wall (endothelium)? OMG HOW DO THEY “JUMP” THERE!? (7/24) https://t.co/MFSyVX01AW\\nNow, if you’re the arrogant type at the peak of #DunningKruger Effect (AKA “Mount Stupid”), you might think “Gotcha!! I read this and now I know better than all the experts in the world! Clearly this disproves 100 years of CVD research!”. And you’d be wrong (8/24) https://t.co/zBd7EsPwwK\\nOn the other hand, if you’re a more moderate, critical thinker but a curious person, you might go “Huh, that’s interesting but I’m probably I’m missing something. I’m sure these folks who do this for a living have thought about this”. And then you’d be right! 😊 (9/24) https://t.co/HgioPmjBKO\\nSo what is the explanation? Before we get there, let’s take a quick poll: without checking, what do you think is the *scale* of the Nakashima images? (10/24)\\nNow, what do you think is the size scale of #LDL lipoproteins?\\n(11/24)\\nNow that we’re done polling, let’s get back to the paper and take a look at the scale bar in the corner of each fig. It’s 100 MICRO meters. Then, let’s remember that LDL particles are in the 20-30 NANO meter range. There’s a THOUSAND fold difference in scale! (12/24) https://t.co/6RFWwsfEzW\\nSo the short answer to the “jump mystery\" is simply image resolution. There ARE indeed #LDL particles in the area just below endothelium but they’re just too small to be seen. If Nakashima et al. had used a microscope with 800x magnification, they might have caught those! (13/24) https://t.co/JLlDjpukCi\\nThink of it this way: essentially the situation is analogous to looking at a satellite image of a city at a scale of individual blocks. At best, the resolution allows you to see large aggregate masses of people but not individual humans (14/24) https://t.co/3gLwZRNo1t\\nSpeaking of mass, back to red stuff. The authors are using a stain called Sudan IV, which turns neutral lipids (triglycerides etc) red. The accumulating redness is the build-up and fusion of nm-sized LDL particles to such a degree it starts to show up in micrometer-scale (15/24) https://t.co/xFCOh41711\\n“But why does it build up like that?” Great question, glad you asked! Aside from the scale bars, we now have to note the little arrows. They indicate something called Internal Elastic Lamina (IEL). It’s right at the border between two layers of the wall (intima and media) (16/24) https://t.co/sEs6HqCXEy\\nFor many macromolecules, IEL is an impermeable barrier. It has holes which are small enough for some HDL particles or albumin to squeeze through but LDLs simply don’t fit. This was shown in seminal work already in the 80’s: https://t.co/c80eK3Mzme (17/24) https://t.co/NGCuaytnFQ\\n(BTW, that paper is related to a line of research showing how the concentration of LDL particles in the wall is more than two-fold to their concentration in blood. The wall is a sticky environment to them and that’s why we don’t want them getting there in the first place) (18/24)\\nSo the red mass shown by Nakashima is essentially a massive amount of LDL particles hitting a wall and forming one great big pile of lipid that stains red! Any questions? Yes, you in the back (19/24) https://t.co/irK0qBvZ3S\\n“But how can we be sure that there REALLY are individual LDLs in the layer just under the endothelium? Are there any studies that HAVE used a sufficiently big magnification that would reveal them?” Another great question! Answer is: yes (20/24) https://t.co/Ewc6d2cyOd\\n@Salehti et al. have used a 3D electron microscope to study small LDL deposits and cholesterol crystals in human carotid arteries. It’s a very nice paper with heaps of interesting data! https://t.co/v2jZUIdPfQ (21/24)\\nAmong others, the paper contains this supplemental figure that clearly shows actual cholesterol CRYSTALS just over 100um from the endothelium (in the Nakashima paper, the red starts to build up around 300-400um) (22/24) https://t.co/njCdWuGQMo\\nSo, in conclusion, the people who look at the Nakashima figure and think there’s something dubious about it that scientists haven’t noticed, are missing the scale difference of plaques and lipoproteins. Scientists investigating atherosclerosis are not stupid (23/24)\\nApoB-containing lipoproteins are travelling in the bloodstream and end up into the arterial walls from there. The more particles, the higher the risk of a build-up over time. That’s what’s shown again and again in multiple lines of evidence that you should believe (24/24)\\nBig thanks to @Salehti for clarifying a few things related to this! Please give her a follow if you’re interested in following an actual expert in lipoprotein infiltration to the arterial wall.\\n\\n/END tweetorial (25/Bonus)',\n",

That’s about as nuts-and-bolts as it gets in the military. (THREAD) https://t.co/GFX5sF0LLY\\nInfantry training is ongoing. Infantry units train constantly. All the time. It’s always something. To the point of being monotonous. If we weren’t at the firing range, we were doing hands-on tactical training. If not tactical, then classroom prep. Always. Something.\\nThousands of hours of training and learning how to kill other people. I am a trained killer. That’s what an infantryman does. They kill. Other soldiers will laugh this off. “Okay, killer.” But they know I’m right. Deep down, that’s your purpose as an infantryman: to kill.\\nIt starts early. Basic training is psychological. You’re supposed to get comfortable with killing. You’re prepared to face this reality. In my barracks at basic training, there was a giant mural of a skull-and-crossbones on the floor. Our official nickname: “Death Dealers”.\\nWe were taught call-and-response chants. Ex: “What makes the grass grow?” “Blood, blood, blood makes the grass grow!”\\n\\nSo many drills have the cry “Kill!” in them. I’m surprised we weren’t required to shout it after eating a meal. Hell, we probably were.\\nI’m not here to tell you military training is bad. I am not a pacifist. Evil threats exist, and violence--as a last resort--is sometimes required. Someone has to kill. But that power has been frequently been abused by our government and held unaccountable in day-to-day life.\\nBecause someone has to kill and the killing falls to the military, psychological training like that makes killing easier. But regardless of where you happen to fall on this method of training, we need to take better accountability of it in the civilian world.\\nThousands of hours of learning how to kill other human beings. Day after day, month after month, year after year. Rewiring of the brain. It becomes second nature. Your body becomes fluent in the language of killing.\\nI’m a flaming liberal. I’m a gun owner but don’t collect them. My idea of “fun” is singing karaoke in a tiara, not a day shooting guns. But there is no doubt in my mind that, if needed, I could kill other human beings efficiently. Tactically. Without hesitation. That\\'s training.\\nI haven’t worn a uniform in almost seven years, but it would be like riding a bike. It’s ingrained. I doubt it’ll ever go away. That’s the point of military training: muscle memory, acting without hesitation, resorting to a part of your brain on autopilot.\\nIn April 2009, Homeland Security released a report warning of the recruitment of veterans by radical groups: https://t.co/Lahh8xZgrn https://t.co/B5w5bZBcJd\\nWhite supremacy tied to military training was noted as a catalyst for a heightened national security risk, which is basically what we’ve seen come to fruition a decade later: https://t.co/mdEB59eVA3\\nPredictably, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano was derided as disrespecting the troops.

Never mind that Napolitano had only ever demonstrated the utmost respect for our folks in uniform.\\nNever mind that a 2008 FBI report identified 203 military veterans in white supremacist terrorist groups: https://t.co/wwaNe9t6D8 https://t.co/1tAS90V9Vo\\nNever mind Charlottesville and the mix of military vets among the little boys playing soldier: https://t.co/kFDqERjGkc\\nNever mind that a Marine killed JFK or that an Army infantryman was behind the Oklahoma City Bombing or the numerous instances of war veterans committing violent crimes using their training. Example: U.S. Army Rangers robbing a bank. https://t.co/Vft4mNumAu\\nOr the higher rate of violence against women (in this case: IPV) among Active Duty military and veterans versus civilians: https://t.co/TcSoFGHDJ7\\nOr that the higher rate of IPV in the military is linked to PTSD and traumatic brain injuries: https://t.co/9ei4CHp0DA\\nOr—and this is important—the well-established relationship between mass shootings and violence against women. A great piece on that subject by Rebeca Traister can be found here: https://t.co/TRdgM1iMc2 https://t.co/QfusLscxTV\\nSurely, that link between violence against women and subsequent mass shootings must count as evidence of terrorism. This is how the FBI defines domestic terrorism: https://t.co/mFOgrDWyB1 https://t.co/uACnt7uPhd\\nNot sure why a mass shooting inspired by hatred of women doesn’t qualify as terrorism… unless, maybe, we don’t respect women as people? Not exactly the most comfortable truth in the national discourse.\\nWhite men are seeing a loss of power, feel victimized, have that irrational entitlement radicalized through white supremacist propaganda, and commit acts of terrorism.\\nBut because they’re white and not shouting “Allahu Akbar”, they’re dismissed as \"nuts\", or more charitably: “nice guys gone wrong.” To admit to “terrorism” by ordinary white men would require asking deeper questions of ourselves, especially those of us in power, i.e. White House.\\nTo admit to “terrorism” by military veterans would require a vast reworking of our systems of recruitment, training, and mental health. Instead, we grant an access of powerful weaponry to those most trained to use it and most likely to do so in brutal acts of terrorism.\\nAn irony of all this is that though we fall back solely on the excuse of “mental health” to wave away acts of terrorism by white men, we neither 1) attempt to comprehensively address mental health in our country nor 2) effectively restrict access to weapons due to it. /thread',\n",
       " \"Libra whitepaper initial analysis: The only digital currency other than bitcoin that matters, and it could succeed massively. But it does not compete with bitcoin, it reinforces bitcoin's value proposition, and will likely need to rely on bitcoin if it succeeds. Thread👇\\nFacebook has some 2 billion accounts, and extremely detailed data on them. Its extensive data mining &amp; identity verification capabilities mean it has the potential to build by far the largest platform by user number of any financial institution.\\nTo on-board billions, Visa or Paypal need to go through people's banks to verify their identity, which is highly expensive, manual and unscalable. FB tracks your every move &amp; knows you better than you or your mom do. They don't need a bank &amp; can scale much faster.\\nAn international transaction on the Visa network has to go through clearance &amp; settlement through many financial institutions and central banks, entailing costs &amp; risks. On Libra, users can transact peer-to-peer through only one institution. The perks of 2b+ users!\\nLibra being backed by national currencies means it is backed by the USD, since all other national currencies at this point are backed by USD and managed by central banks to try to stay stable against the dollar. Other government coins are just dollars + issuer risk.\\nFor billions of people, a dollar-backed Libra on your phone globally is infinitely superior to national currency in market depth &amp; maintaining value. If it succeeds, Libra will likely destroy most 3rd world currencies, or force them to be fully pegged to &amp; backed by the US dollar\\nFor billions of people, a FB-based payment network will offer more and cheaper transactions than any other KYC/AML platforms. If it succeeds, Libra will likely eat most fiat payment processors like Visa, Paypal, and Western Union, particularly those functioning in the third world\\nDot not underestimate how powerful and beneficial such a network could be. If access to global finance &amp; the USD were as easy as access to a FB account, billions of people's lives would be improved drastically.\\nHaving said that, it's important to remember all of this is far easier said than done. Regulatory approval internationally is the main hurdle to overcome. But given the money, power &amp; influence FB has, they might pull this off.\\nBut to be clear, Facebook is building a centralized payment processor on the US dollar and calling it a blockchain. Like all centralized shitcoins, they've set up a 'Foundation' to pretend the thing is independent. They're even pretending its development will be open source.\\nAs shitcoins amply demonstrate, these pretenses are far easier to maintain in the whitepaper stage. Good luck to the Libra team keeping your development and blockchain open when people try to use them to send money to Iran.\\nThe foundation will remain independent until it tries to do something against FB's wishes. Will FB just allow its billions of users to seamlessly shift to a Libra they don't like? FB users' access to Libra can be turned off by FB, utterly subjugating the foundation to FB's will.\\nThe only functional advantage of calling this centralized system a blockchain is arguably in regulation. Easier to get things by regulators by using crypto buzzwords than admitting to just running a bank. Otherwise, everything would be more efficient if centralized.\\nFB's comparative advantage is in processing peer-to-peer payments between its members, not in building the monetary system on which these payments are based. As long as government currencies rule, FB are beholden by their regulators.\\nIn search of bribes, political favors, and attention-whoring, every politician worldwide will want to put barriers in the face of Libra. The French are already leading the way: https://t.co/AYwQJcYk4H\\nA global payment network governed by dozens of governments is unworkable in the long run. The 'monetary nationalism' problem Hayek identified in 1930s can't be solved with payment processors, it needs a global free market money free from government control https://t.co/NC1dpXntPG\\nNo amount of cryptography, blockchains, or independent foundations will stop you from being politically controlled, unless you are bitcoin, for reasons explained in detail in my book's last chapter: https://t.co/v0r3uJB3XR\\nFurther, no amount of appeals to 'decentralization' or 'blockchain' buzzwords will mask the fact that the system will be completely authoritarian, with FB maintaining full surveillance and censorship capabilities.\\nSo if it is to succeed, FB has to become the executive arm of the US Government's financial, intelligence &amp; foreign policies. And its decentralized foundation will have to do USG's bidding on everything from monetary policy to banking regulations and sanctions.\\nBut by increasing people's financial freedom while remaining politically controlled, Libra would be digging its own grave. All the problems of political money in the 20th century would remain, but people would find it much easier to opt out from than regular govt moneys.\\nThere are no armies forcing you to accept Libra, but a world in which everyone has their money on an app is a world in which everyone is a click away from bitcoin. History shows us hard moneys tend to kill easy moneys when the two are exchangeable: https://t.co/v0r3uJB3XR\\nBitcoin is hard money, it is apolitical, neutral, censorship free, and it can't even spy on you if it wanted to. All of these are things FB can never install on Libra.\\nFB shouldn't think of itself as competing with Bitcoin, as that's how they'll becoming an irrelevant stupid shitcoin like the thousands we have. In the long-run, Bitcoin represents the only chance for FB to build Libra on a global neutral protocol, and not on a political currency\\nSo, if govts let it, Libra will likely kill most KYC/AML fiat processors &amp; currencies, producing a global digital payment system based on USD. The problems it'll face then are the same problems faced by any political monetary system, to which bitcoin is the only working solution.\\nIn the short-run, Libra will only survive by being subservient to the USD &amp; pegged to it. In the long-run, it will only survive by being subservient to bitcoin and pegged to it. The only other fate possible is the life &amp; inevitable death of yet another irrelevant stupid shitcoin.\",\n",
       " 'Attorney General Barr has deliberately misrepresented key aspects of Mueller’s report and decisions in the investigation, which has helped further the president’s false narrative about the investigation.\\nAfter receiving Mueller’s report, Barr wrote and released a letter on March 24 describing Barr’s own decision not to indict the president for obstruction of justice. That letter selectively quotes and summarizes points in Mueller’s report in misleading ways.\\nMueller’s report says he chose not to decide whether Trump broke the law because there’s an official DoJ opinion that indicting a sitting president is unconstitutional, and because of concerns about impacting the president’s ability to govern and pre-empting possible impeachment.\\nBarr’s letter doesn’t mention those issues when explaining why Mueller chose not to make a prosecutorial decision. He instead selectively quotes Mueller in a way that makes it sound—falsely—as if Mueller’s decision stemmed from legal/factual issues specific to Trump’s actions.\\nBut, in fact, Mueller finds considerable evidence that several of Trump’s actions detailed in the report meet the elements of obstruction, and Mueller’s constitutional and prudential issues with indicting a sitting president would preclude indictment regardless of what he found.\\nIn noting why Barr thought the president’s intent in impeding the investigation was insufficient to establish obstruction, Barr selectively quotes Mueller to make it sound as if his analysis was much closer to Barr’s analysis than it actually was:\\nBarr quotes Mueller saying the evidence didn’t establish that Trump was personally involved in crimes related to Russian election interference, and Barr then claims that Mueller found that fact relevant to whether the president had the intent to obstruct justice.\\nBut Mueller’s quote is taken from a section in which he describes other improper motives Trump could have had and notes: “The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.” None of that is in Barr’s letter.\\nAs a result of Barr’s March 24 letter, the public and Congress were misled. Mueller himself notes this in a March 27 letter to Barr, saying that Barr’s letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.”\\nMueller: “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”\\nTo “alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen,” Mueller urged the release of the report’s introductions and executive summaries, which he had told Barr “accurately summarize [Mueller’s] Office’s work and conclusions.”\\nBarr declined; he allowed the confusion to fester and only released the materials three weeks later with the full redacted report. In the interim, Barr testified before a House committee and was misleading about his knowledge of Mueller’s concerns:\\nBarr was asked about reports “that members of [Mueller’s] team are frustrated…with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?”\\nBarr absurdly replied: “No, I don’t…I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.” Yet Mueller had directly raised those concerns to Barr, and Barr says he “suspect[s]” they “probably” wanted more materials put out, as if Mueller hadn’t directly told him that.\\nIn subsequent statements and testimony, Barr used further misrepresentations to help build the president’s false narrative that the investigation was unjustified.\\nBarr notes that Mueller did not “find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.” He then declares that Mueller found “no collusion” and implies falsely that the investigation was baseless.\\nBut whether there’s enough evidence for a conviction of a specific crime which Mueller thought was appropriate to charge is a different and much higher standard than whether the people whom Mueller investigated had done anything worthy of investigation.\\nIn truth, Mueller’s report describes concerning contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and people in or connected to the Russian government.\\nFor instance, Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner took a meeting with a Russian lawyer whom Trump Jr. had been told worked for the Russian government and would provide documents to “incriminate Hillary,” as part of the Russian government’s “support for Mr. Trump.”\\nIt’s wrong to suggest that the fact that Mueller did not choose to indict anyone for this means there wasn’t a basis to investigate whether it amounted to a crime or “collusion,” or whether it was in fact part of Russia’s efforts to help Trump’s candidacy.\\nBarr says the White House “fully cooperated” with the investigation and that Mueller “never sought” or “pushed” to get more from the president, but the report says Mueller unsuccessfully sought an interview with the president for over a year.\\nThe report says the president’s counsel was told that interviewing him was “vital” to Mueller’s investigation and that it would be in the interest of the public and the presidency. Still Trump refused.\\nThe president instead gave written answers to questions submitted by the special counsel. Those answers are often incomplete or unresponsive. Mueller found them “inadequate” and again sought to interview the president.\\nUltimately, the special counsel “recogniz[ed] that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily” and chose not to subpoena him because of concerns that the resulting “potentially lengthy constitutional litigation” would delay completion of the investigation.\\nBarr has so far successfully used his position to sell the president’s false narrative to the American people. This will continue if those who have read the report do not start pushing back on his misrepresentations and share the truth.',\n",
       " '1. THREAD  Himpathy: An unsympathetic but fair-minded assessment. \\n\\nHimpathy, forwarded by the philosopher Kate Manne, is either completely wrong or partially correct but poorly named and misleading.\\n2. Himpathy is the hypothesis that either (1) people generally sympathize with men more than women (hence the name), or (2) people generally sympathize with *powerful* men more than low status women (or \"their low status victims\").\\n3. Version 1 of the hypothesis, one that I often see people forward, is almost certainly false. So, let\\'s focus on that version before moving to version 2. \\n\\nFirst, it contradicts everyday experience. Women much more than men are used as victims PRECISELY because we sympathize.\\n4. In movies, harm to women is used to illustrate that somebody is truly heinous. The saying \"women and children first,\" although not always practiced, certainly suggests more concern for potential women victims. Our reluctance to allow women into battle, the same.\\n5. Furthermore, a priori evolutionary logic suggests that society would sympathize more with female victims than male victims (of equal status). I can\\'t go through all of sexual selection theory here, but the important thing is this: Females have the more \"valuable\" sex cell.\\n6. Think of extreme case. One group with 100 women and 25 men. The men could get all the women pregnant. The reverse, though, 100 men and 25 women, would be a reproductive problem for a social group, and a recipe for coalitional collapse.\\n7. Men\\'s sex cells are cheap; therefore, men are more disposable, especially low status men. This is why men have almost always been forced to die more often than women (in war, in dangerous jobs, et cetera). \\n\\nhttps://t.co/JtzD9AzlH5\\n8. Research supports this. Women are seen as more sympathetic victims. People want to punish male perpetrators more harshly. People believe women victims will experience more pain. And people support policies that help only women more than those that help only men.\\n9. To my knowledge, Manne\\'s only real response to this is to point to studies that show that people believe that men (boys) experience more pain than women (e.g., https://t.co/SYnLCdcPyI). However, as @ImHardcory and others have noted, there is a rather obvious explanation.\\n10. People believe that boys/men are more tolerant of pain and are more likely to suppress expressions of pain. Indeed, in the study cited by the WaPo, the effect disappeared when researchers controlled for perceptions of \"stoicism.\"\\n11. Think of an obvious analogy. If shown a film of an adult and a child getting pricked and displaying the same expression, most viewers would believe the adult is experiencing MORE pain. Why? Because adults generally react more stoically to pain.\\n12. Of course, nobody would print moralistic headlines \"Americans take adults\\' pain more seriously than children\\'s!\" And nobody would contend this supported a theory that people sympathize more with adult victims than with children victims.\\n13. Hypothesis version 1, therefore, seems completely untenable to me. In fact, I think observation, theory, and evidence all suggest that it is exactly the opposite of the truth; and likely it would be ignored if not ideologically useful.\\n14. Version 2, however, is a bit more plausible, if stripped of its sex-based formulation so that it reads, \"People value high status people more than low status people; and they sometimes let high status people get away with heinous crimes if the victims are low status people.\"\\n15. Of course, this ruins \"himpathy\" and makes the \"sympathy\" not a manifestation of the background misogyny of society, but rather of a natural propensity to favor high status people over others. In fact, the effect is almost certainly stronger if the victims are men, not women\\n16. In an interview with Vox, Manne forwarded two examples that support the notion that society is \"pathologically\" sympathetic to powerful men: The Kavanaugh hearings and Brock Turner. Yes, you read that correctly, Brock Turner. But we\\'ll get to that.\\n17. Manne uses Trump\\'s dismissals of Ford\\'s testimony about Kavanaugh as evidence of himpathy. Ford, according to Manne, was \"totally erased from the discourse.\" \\n\\nhttps://t.co/wZt6vASsuu\\n18. Trump is callous and boorish, so unsurprisingly he did not handle the situation well. \\n\\nBut (1) Ford testified and many, many people believed her (she was certainly not erased); and (2) attitudes about Kavanaugh were largely partisan, so this example is not useful.\\n19. The Brock Turner example was shocking to me since he is nearly universally reviled. Here is what Manne said, \"And what we saw, from his father and his friends, was this wave of sympathy over what the whole ordeal was costing him.\"\\n20. This is called kin-selection and tribalism, not himpathy. Of course his friends sympathized with him. And they would have if he were a woman as well. I\\'m sure many family members have sympathized with ruthless, cold-blooded women. \\n\\nHow does the rest of society feel?\\n21. So far as I can tell, very few people sympathized with him. He is generally depicted as a spoiled, privileged asshole who got a lucky break from an asshole judge. And many were outraged at his lenient sentence. Judge for yourself. Do a Google search.\\n22. Now, ask yourself this: If I used an example this ludicrous to support a theory that Vox and other progressives disagreed with, would they ever let it pass? Is there any evidence that most normal Americans experienced a wave of sympathy for Brock Turner??\\n23. What is true, however, is that HIGH STATUS PEOPLE probably do and have for a long time received preferential treatment. In many ancient law codes, including Anglo-Saxon and Roman among others, high status people were explicitly treated differently from low status people.\\n24. Although our law codes discarded this preferential treatment, it stems from a natural human propensity to admire and defer to high status people. So, in this very circumscribed sense, Manne\\'s hypothesis is probably 60% true. BUT, it\\'s not about sex.\\n25. It\\'s about status. It\\'s not himpathy. It\\'s hierarchy. And, my guess is that there would be an interaction such that a female victim would increase not decrease our hatred of a powerful perpetrator and increase not decrease our sympathy for the victim.

       " '(1) The story of #RubyRidge is nothing but heartbreaking.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a moment to discuss a story the Federal Government would rather be forgotten. A story of a family that only wanted to worship their God, raise their children, and be left alone. https://t.co/fJpOr5160X\\n(2) #StoryTime. Ruby Ridge is an outstretch of mountains in the northernmost part of Idaho, in a county named Boundary, as it rests right along the Canadian border, between the Washington and Montana borders.\\n\\nWhen someone wants to be left alone, Ruby Ridge is one place they go. https://t.co/tOI7Ey0qz0\\n(3) One person who wished nothing more than to be left alone was Randy Weaver. Weaver was a devout Christian &amp; US Army vet who had become disillusioned with his government; in the early 1980\\'s, he moved his family to a 20-acre plot of land on Ruby Ridge and built himself a home. https://t.co/hgIuTAYyQG\\n(4) He had no electricity. He had no running water. But he had his family, his faith, and the work of his hands, and with these he created a life for himself.\\n\\nBut about ten miles from where Randy chose to build his home was an Aryan Nations compound.\\n(5) Now, there is no evidence to suggest that Randy Weaver or his family harboured any white supremacist thoughts, despite what reports these days would say. But the Aryan Nations people were the only people around, with whom Randy could trade.\\n\\nAnd on rare occasion, he did.\\n(6) The Aryan Nations compound near Randy\\'s home had been, for a couple years, a target of the FBI. And when Randy showed up, he stuck out like a sore thumb.\\n\\nThis made Randy and his family a ripe target for the FBI to use. An undercover informant took advantage of Randy\\'s needs.\\n(7) When the informant learned that Randy was looking for work at the compound, he saw opportunity. So he asked Randy to saw off a couple shotguns.\\n\\nThis was entrapment, pure and simple. If Randy made these illegal weapons, the FBI/ATF would be justified to get a warrant. https://t.co/NBVC0LZMMn\\n(8) And they did get their warrant. They must have been thinking, \"If we can arrest this man, we can use him to get to bigger and more dangerous people in the Aryan Nations.\"\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what they got. The ATF arrested Randy in July of 1990.\\n(9) The FBI immediately asked Randy to turn State\\'s Witness against the Aryan Nations, and he refused -- not because he held sympathies for white separatists, but because he had once before been lied about and pursued by the government, in 1985. https://t.co/FcU6M2xboo\\n(10) In fact, the Secret Service, ATF, and FBI did nothing to assuage Weaver\\'s distrust of the government. They doubled down on their accusations of him being a white supremacist, a bank robber and wished to kill the president.\\n\\nIt was all untrue. And Weaver vehemently denied it.\\n(11) They could not hold Randy for long, and he eventually returned to his home in Ruby Ridge. But in December of 1990, a grand jury dismissed the bank robbery and treason charges, and indicted Weaver on charges of making illegal firearms.\\n(12) By this time, the ATF had built up this image in their mind. They thought of Randy Weaver in the same way we think of terrorists today: bunkered down with thousands of bullets at their disposal.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t just walk up to his house and arrest him,\" they convinced themselves.\\n(13) So instead, they waited. They knew Randy Weaver wouldn\\'t show up for his trial, and when he inevitably didn\\'t, they gained the help of the Marshals Service.\\n\\nSurveillance was set up all around the Weaver home. Snipers took up position at all angles. They watched and waited.\\n(14) When the Marshals were brought in on the case, they had not been informed of WHY Randy Weaver was being sought. No one told them about the shotguns. No one told them about the attempts to solicit a State\\'s Witness.\\n\\nAll they knew was this man was evading the law. https://t.co/3Zew363gIi\\n(15) There were three units. Two surveillance units set up a good distance away with sniper rifles, spotting and surveillance equipment, and one ground unit which happened to be trespassing on the Weaver property by a good distance.\\n\\nAnd Randy\\'s dog could smell them.\\n(16) Randy\\'s dog went after the ground unit. Very little information is known about what happened during the early stages, but what is known is that shots were fired by both sides, starting with the Marshals shooting Randy\\'s dog.\\n\\nAnd then Randy\\'s son, Sammy Weaver. https://t.co/Qr8kdCrdGK\\n(17) These were people of the forest. They didn\\'t get their food from the grocery store; they hunted and grew their food right there around their property. Every one of the Weavers was handy with a gun.\\n\\nAnd they fought back. US Marshal William Degan was shot &amp; killed.\\n(18) This drove the federal officers into a frenzy. Suddenly, dozens of FBI, ATF, and US Marshal units are being deployed in this remote mountain forest in northern Idaho. They\\'re ready to get revenge for their fallen brother in arms.\\n\\nThey think this is another Robert Matthews.\\n(19) And because they think this is another Robert Matthews, they decide that a surrender order does not need to be given. Instead, the federal officers are told they can open fire as soon as they see any armed adult.\\n\\nBut the Weavers are hunters. They\\'re always armed.\\n(20) The federal agents were prepared for war. Roadblocks were set up. Helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, humvees were brought out in an overwhelming display of force.\\n\\nAnd on the morning of August 22, 1992, all the Weavers wanted to do was see the body of their son.\\n(21) They head to the shed where Sammy\\'s body had been stored, and they take with them their weapons. A shot rings out.\\n\\nCRACKKK. Randy is hit in the shoulder. They run back to the house.\\n\\nCRACKKKK. Another shot goes right through Vicki Weaver\\'s face. https://t.co/InFlSnItQn\\n(22) Word came down the mountain quickly after Vicki\\'s death. Neighbors, friends of the Weavers, supporters, news crews had gathered down at the road up to Ruby Ridge, and her death drove them to riot.\\n\\nTheir worst fears had come true. A tyrannical force was killing Americans. https://t.co/Qbb1psJZe0\\n(23) Again, the history is skewed. People like to say that the roadblock was filled with skinheads and racists -- but they were a tiny minority.\\n\\nMost were just proud Americans, like you see in the picture above. Of 200-300 people, maybe 10 people were  from the Aryan Nations.\\n(24) After 11 days of stand-off, Randy Weaver eventually surrendered to the FBI. He was terribly wounded from the bullet in his shoulder.\\n\\nIt could have been avoided at so many points. The entrapment. The falsifying of charges. Shooting the dog. Foregoing the surrender order. https://t.co/WrjNKR0zHH\\n(25) But even now, more than 25 years later, the government cannot be honest about its failures at Ruby Ridge. \"They were white separatists,\" they say. \"It wasn\\'t our fault,\" they tell themselves.\\n\\nThe history is tweaked to give the government excuse. But we know better.\\n(26) All the Weavers wanted was to be left alone. And because of that, the government grew suspicious of them. Lied about them. Used entrapment to try and use them.\\n\\nThe scariest words in the English language really are, \"I\\'m from the government and I\\'m here to help.\" https://t.co/QNRL8fEPAj',\n",
       " '1. I want to talk about ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 13-years-old. To say it\\'s misunderstood (both by people who have ADHD and people who don\\'t have it) is an understatement. What people need to understand about those of us who have ADHD is we are not homogeneous\\n2. Because many people think those with ADHD all have similar symptoms and challenges, we don\\'t often get the empathy and support we need. ADHD is something we live with every day, hour, minute. It can ravage our lives and you may not even be aware of it.\\n3. When people have asked me in the past to describe what ADHD feels like I get into details about how it impacts my life every day but I always add that for me that ADHD has caused me a great deal of emotional pain. It\\'s a frustrating, infuriating disorder.\\n4. I want to be clear, I don\\'t speak for everyone with ADHD but I have spoken to enough people over the last two years with ADHD that I feel comfortable speaking about it publicly.\\n5. People who don\\'t have ADHD often oversimplify what it means to have ADHD. I don\\'t blame them, they\\'re not living with ADHD. But that\\'s one of the reasons ADHD is so misunderstood because it\\'s anything but simple. That\\'s why it\\'s so hurtful when people jokingly say \"squirrel\"\\n6. Whenever someone brings up ADHD. It makes it seem like it\\'s is just an issue of distraction. Wrong! For example, I read 2-3 books a week! I don\\'t know many people with ADHD can do that. But for me taking clothes out of the dryer &amp; folding them, that\\'s like climbing Mt. Everest\\n7. Those of us with ADHD don\\'t need your sympathy, we need your empathy. We need you to understand that we are capable of so much but just need you to understand what our limits and challenges are. We don\\'t want you to see our limits/challenges as excuses...they\\'re explanations\\n8. For example, people will often say that people with ADHD tend to procrastinate. That is a total misunderstanding of what ADHD is about. Procrastination has a connotation of intentionally putting something off for various reasons. We don\\'t want to be this way.\\n9. For people with ADHD the issue is often the difficulty starting things. It is enormously challenging for us in certain categories. The simplest things can be exhausting and feel impossible to begin/finish. It\\'s stuff that doesn\\'t make sense to people without ADHD.\\n10. Which is often why we hide these things that we find challenging because they can be embarrassing. I once had someone with ADHD, who made a good living, tell me that for years they would pay bills when things got shut off. It was a cycle they found nearly impossible\\n11. To get out of, it destroyed their credit, and it was only when they got married and their wife took over that they fixed their bill paying issue. People with ADHD hide a lot of shame in this and we hold it in because people don\\'t understand our diagnosis.\\n12. Because of this shame, we don\\'t talk about ADHD generally. We may talk about it with close family members or a psychiatrist but we don\\'t talk about it with our friends &amp; certainly don\\'t talk about it at work (I know this is a generalization and may not be true for you)\\n13. As egotistical as this may sound, I really hope to change that. I\\'ve been thinking about talking about ADHD for a few months and finally acknowledged how misunderstood it is among adults. Because we don\\'t talk about it, ADHD has a big impact at work and home.\\n14. Now, I realize that being able to talk about it is a privilege. People rightly fear that they could be seen differently at work or may not get assignments they deserve. This is a step-by-step process that will take a while...but it\\'s so important because ADHD has an impact\\n15. On people being successful at work and even getting a job. Some people think ADHD is over diagnosed...I don\\'t know if it is or isn\\'t, but I can tell you if it is, it\\'s over diagnosed in kids. It\\'s under diagnosed among adults. We know that if someone isn\\'t diagnosed\\n16. As child, they\\'re less likely to be diagnosed as an adult. Many people see ADHD (because of the hyperactivity component...which not all people with ADHD have) as a boy/man\\'s disorder...which leads many women to not be diagnosed.\\n17. At home ADHD can have a big impact on relationships, we have a hard time staying organized and tidy. This can have an impact on relationships. I have taught myself many tricks over the years but many people with ADHD aren\\'t taught to be mindful of their ADHD.\\n18. Want to know why I have so many towels? Yes, I can be bougie...I\\'ll admit it. But its because it allows me to keep my bathroom organized. I found that it was very hard for me, especially when I have a lot of things going on in my life, to lay my towel over the bar.\\n19. My towel would often end up on the floor and I didn\\'t want to live that way anymore. So I realized that if I just put a basket in my bathroom I could toss towels in there. Is it crazy to use a towel once and wash it? No doubt...but the alternative wasn\\'t very attractive\\n20. What I have learned about ADHD is that it can ravage ones life if you let little things slip. I knew if I kept dropping the towel on the floor, I wouldn\\'t make my bed, I wouldn\\'t put my clothes away. Then, that would lead me to get depressed with the state of my home\\n21. And that would then bleed into my work, etc. I have had mixed success explaining my triggers to people. Some think I\\'m making excuses or they just don\\'t understand why a simple thing like hanging a towel is a challenge. But I\\'m not going to stop explaining it\\n22. Last year I was meeting with a company that wanted to hire me and I told them I have ADHD and would find it challenging to work in an open office environment..the people I was speaking to understood that and were happy to accommodate it. But it hasn\\'t always been easy\\n23. One of the challenges for me is in order to focus on something like writing, unless I have the adrenaline that comes with not wanting to get scooped, I have to really shut out everything. But people don\\'t understand that I can\\'t do a back and forth when I\\'m in that zone.\\n24. In the past (before I learned what systems I needed in place) I would see an email come in from a friend or colleague asking to chat. I would tell them I was focused on work and they would often say \"it\\'ll just take a minute!\" They didn\\'t get if I gave them that minute\\n25. That there was a good chance I wouldn\\'t be able to get back to my work. People would get annoyed and think I was being difficult. That\\'s the reason I\\'m talking about ADHD now, I hope people on both sides of ADHD can be more mindful of what works and doesn\\'t work. (cont)\\n26. The best way I heard ADHD symptoms described was \"a Venn diagram with many circles.\" But it all boils down to this: we have things that challenge us, things that may seem simple/silly to you, but they\\'re things that can quite  take over and destroy our lives if not addressed.',\n",

Tried to vilify the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Cut off media access. Only held town hall meetings that allowed vetted CPC supporters... 13/25\\nFired and vilified whistle-blowers like Linda Keen and Richard Colvin.

Wasted our money on Economic Action Plan billboards and ads... 14/25\\nNot to mention ads bought in Eastern Europe to tell Roma people they were not welcome in Canada.  And ads in the US to promote the CPC and the pipelines. 15/25\\nHe locked himself in a bathroom in a fit of pique while on an international trip.

Apparently to satisfy a primal urge for vengeance among his base. 17/25\\nHe brought in boutique tax credits to pander to people who already had money and ignored those who didn\\'t. He brought in a taxable child benefit. He suggested a \"barbaric cultural practices tip-line\" \"Hey Old Stock Canadians!

When it comes down to it, that is a trademark of the current conservative parties. A callous disregard for the value of life unless the person is someone they... 20/25\\nApprove of or could be useful to them. And if you think the CPC is under new management, well, conservative insiders say Harper is still pulling the strings and running things from an un-elected position behind the scene. 21/25 https://t.co/gdMtEurvBB\\nAndrew Scheer hired Hamish Marshall, co-founder of the racist hate-propaganda site, The Rebel, as his campaign manager. Georgette Burke, founder of an anti-Islam group is one of his advisors, A Trump campaigner is running as a CPC candidate. 22/25\\nThe CPC freely associate with racist/misogynist/homophobic groups. They want US gun laws and US nukes on our land. They cheat in elections. They show no regard for the environment. They pander to their base and their donors. No one else matters. 23/25\\nIf you can know all this and still say you vote CPC because you are only fiscally conservative, you are saying one of two things. Hint: neither reflects well on you. 24/25\\nYou are either saying you actually are a racist/homophobe/misogynist and it just makes you mad when other people know it, or you care more about money than people. There\\'s no way around that. That\\'s really sad. 25/25\\nEssentially, in case I did not make it clear earlier. if you vote CPC you are complicit. You don\\'t get to cherry-pick parts of a platform.

Ever.\\nThe lunch in question was shrimp fried rice which means this escalates from a misdemeanor to felony no doubt\\nCase facts:\\nLunch was in fridge for less than an hour before it vanished. No shrimp smell remnants in the microwave or kitchen area. This was a professional hit no doubt\\nHOLY SHIT. He’s back. He watched the tape. He knows who did it.\\nSo the man who’s lunch was stolen sits across from me. The person who  stole his lunch sits RIGHT NEXT TO ME! She left for the day before the investigation started\\nAccording to the video, this psychopath DIDNT EVEN EAT THE FOOD. She took it out of the fridge and threw and buried it in the trash\\nHer motives remain completely unknown. In lieu of what he saw on the tape he has decided to not to press the matter anymore. I can’t say I blame him. We don’t know what this women’s fully capable of\\nPoints to clarify: he bought the shrimp fried rice around 11:30am (carry out) and put it in the fridge to chill until he takes lunch at noon. So she had exactly a 30min window of time to do what she did. There was no intention of microwaving the food\\nUpdate: Ok so when dude watched the video with HR they asked “what do you want to do about it?” he told them he was solely interested in who did it and that he didn’t want to be responsible for someone getting fired\\nAfter charges were dropped, HR sent a company wide email about not stealing people’s lunches. She is scheduled to arrive at work in 20min.  My blood is on cocaine\\nShe has walked into the room. And the room is dead silent. Dead fucking silent yet there is a palpable explosive energy pulsing through everyone but her\\nFrom the moment she walked in, I’ve just been staring at her. Watched her open her email and now she clicked on the goddamn HR email! Holy fuck strap in - here we go!\\nI can’t move. I simply cannot move, anything could happen right now\\n!!!! After seeing the HR email she says out loud “woah. Someone stole a lunch? Who would do something like that?” !!! I may have to run out of this room\\nAfter she said that, shrimp guy responds “well yea it’s not ok to throw someone’s food away” we’re all about to start screaming\\nThis shits about to get crazier. After he says that she goes “oh it was your lunch?” BEAT she continues “well why would you go to HR about that?!”\\nShe has simultaneously denied her involvement AND called the guy who saved her job a snitch!!!!!!!!!\\nDude just sighed and went back to work after she said what she said. She looks frightwningly calm\\nI’ll keep updating if anything else occurs but all I can say is that EVERYONE in the office from the janitor to the founder knows what she did. She now carries an invisible scarlet letter\\nThis is real. This is happening. We know who did it but we don’t know why. It’s a post production company so we’re in fact open today. She’s been sitting 3ft from me this whole time\\nUnbeknownst to the guy and the woman, I just ordered 3 shrimp fried rice plates for lunch and will be hand delivering them\\nShe took the fried rice from me with a big smile on her face. She’s eating it and loving it. This is utter ruthlessness\\n“I LOVE shrimp fried rice” - the thief\\nI wish I could close this up with a neat little bow, but, it appears that we may never know why she did it. Maybe she doesn’t know she did it. Either way I’m now forced to work 40hrs a week next to a cold blooded individual\\nMonday Morning Update: I was the first one into the office. She was the second. Just her and I, sitting 3ft away from each other in an empty room for over an hour. Every breath felt borrowed.\\nShe has not seen any of this. OR she is thoroughly and convincingly pretending not that have seen it. Either way I’m still alive. Thank you for reading.',\n",

hints of Trump\\'s knowledge of the mtg &amp; involvement in the false story Don Jr. initially put out. https://t.co/h17V9rYd7w\\n2A) Senate Judiciary Democrats released an Interim Report on the #TrumpRussia investigation. https://t.co/OsmPB5KDyN\\n2B) The minority report lays out inconsistencies in details &amp; testimony re: the Trump Tower meeting &amp; areas that need more investigation.\\n\\nIts intriguing that it says there are docs suggesting Russia funneled money to the Trump campaign through the @NRA. https://t.co/eJBh0hhnlm\\n3A) @SenatorBurr &amp; @MarkWarner announced the Senate Intel Committee has completed the first part of its investigation , which deals with Russian interference in our election, &amp; have written a report to be released after it\\'s cleared by the intel community. https://t.co/wKfxBjxXvP\\n3B) The bipartisan Senate Intel report will, contrary to the Republican House Intel report, confirm that Russia interfered on behalf of Trump and that U.S. intel agencies did an excellent assessment in January 2017. https://t.co/4wbvw8Xgzx\\n4A) @NewYorker reported that a law enforcement whistleblower gave the Michael Cohen SAR (suspicious activity report) to @MichaelAvenatti. https://t.co/iL1l3ctrkk\\n4B) The whistleblower leaked the SAR because two previous SARs it referenced had disappeared from the FinCEN database and he/she feared they were being suppressed by the Trump administration. https://t.co/UqgG8ww0a1\\n4C) Closely related, @RepMaxineWaters said on @MSNBC that she wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin in January to inquire if he was ever asked to destroy records related to Trump or his associates.\\n\\nShe never got an answer. https://t.co/8fCqtaplnf\\n5A) Rudy Giuliani asserted that #Mueller\\'s team had told him they will not indict Trump while he is president. https://t.co/F88UWlYYp8\\n5B) This is not surprising because #Mueller is subject to DOJ rules &amp; they provide that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\\n\\nHowever, it does suggest Mueller has moved beyond \"was a crime committed?\" to \"can I indict Trump?\"\\n\\n https://t.co/7wgNwkrAOC\\n6A) The former head of Qatar\\'s Investment Authority, Ahmed al Rumaihi, (who attended a 12/12/16 Trump Tower meeting) said Michael Cohen asked him for a $1 million payment for access to administration/infrastructure projects. https://t.co/IKu9RXK3oC\\n6B) This is the same al-Ramaihi who is said in a sworn court affidavit in the \"Ice Cube\" lawsuit to have told a Bannon friend that Qatar wanted to offer funding to Bannon after the WH fired him, &amp; when rebuffed, offered that Flynn had taken Qatar\\'s money. https://t.co/UAO9huaKk1\\n7A) Trump filed his annual financial disclosure, and it disclosed the loan from Michael Cohen (now repaid) to fund the $130k #StormyDaniels payment. \\n\\nTrump had previously denied knowledge of the payment, both directly &amp; via his attorneys. https://t.co/drc7P2qLJh\\n7B) @OfficeGovEthics referred the #StormyDaniels payment matter to #Mueller as potentially relating to one of his investigations.\\n\\nThe filing should have been made last year and various disclosure/FEC laws were likely broken. https://t.co/rCeJDJaJmC\\n8A) It was reported that #Mueller has subpoenaed Roger Stone\\'s social media consultant, Jason Sullivan, who worked on the Trump campaign. \\nhttps://t.co/IY8JWuUnrL\\n8B) #Mueller\\'s subpoena of Sullivan suggests Stone may be a target of his investigation and that Mueller is looking into his possible coordination with Wikileaks and/or hackers. https://t.co/iiD2b8Vc8i\\n9A) @nytimes had a major story assessing what was going on at the FBI during the months before the election, and how it affected the Times\\' coverage. https://t.co/n3sd6po3rc\\n9B) The FBI assumed HRC would win &amp; was paranoid that Trump would paint it as partisan.\\n\\nThus, the FBI threw cold water on the story a week before the election, resulting in the headline \"Investigating Donald Trump, FBI finds no clear link to Russia.\" \\nhttps://t.co/dzqEcui2MT\\n10A) @chrisinsilico, the #CambridgeAnalytica whistleblower, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/2U6f4fLvHb\\n10B) Wylie testified that Steve Bannon was extremely interested in using psychographic data to suppress voting, especially among minorities more likely to vote for Democrats. https://t.co/GsBhP7Sawj\\n11A) Michael Cohen was working on a Trump Tower Moscow deal until very close to Trump\\'s nomination. https://t.co/rUVVZMTJhe\\n11B) Cohen previously claimed the Trump Moscow Tower project was dropped in January 2016, but texts &amp; emails between Cohen and Felix Sater show it continued into the 2nd half of 2016.\\n\\nTrump at the time was claiming he had no ties to Russia. https://t.co/C61Y9cVg7u\\n12) So now you\\'re caught up on the double digit #TrumpRussia developments from Wed.\\n\\nNext question is, \"What can YOU do to help?\"\\n\\nStep 1 - Sign up at https://t.co/U6JcNSOxpL for \\'rapid response.\\'\\n\\nVolume of sign-ups (now 350k+) is a deterrent to Trump crossing our red lines. https://t.co/WJnrgE7vjB\\n13) Step 2 - Call your senators &amp;

       " 'THREAD. What is Theresa May’s legacy on immigration? Given she quoted Nicolas Winton, who saved hundreds of child refugees before WW2 I’ll start with refugees.\\nBack in 2015, May said in a big speech “I want us to work to reduce the asylum claims made in Britain.” She did everything she could to deliver on that but claims actually went up https://t.co/738mr9s2eN\\nShe claimed in that speech it was immoral not to resettle more refugees. But failed to expand the number of resettlement places as Home Sec or as PM.\\nShe ended automatic settlement for refugees after five years, deliberately leaving refugees uncertain whether they would eventually be kicked out. https://t.co/HGqPuE3fyd\\nShe introduced a new policy in 2014 that prevents some recognised refugees from getting British citizenship because of the way they entered the UK in the first place https://t.co/BirzfJX8tU\\nPerhaps her main legacy is the quiet revolution in immigration policy that is the hostile environment: citizen on citizen immigration checks. https://t.co/UKvAe21xos\\nOne of the most obvious direct effects of the hostile environment was the Windrush scandal, where legally resident BME people lost their jobs, health care and dignity. \\n\\nThat rests squarely on Theresa May’s shoulders.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/DZmGV7fBy3\\nThen there was the huge increase in citizenship stripping under Theresa May, much of which was later found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/NoUMmpO7Ri https://t.co/nQH6KfEy8r\\nHow about the thousands of “Skype families” created by her harsh new family immigration rules introduced in 2012? Children are forced abroad or separated from one of their parents by the £18,600 earnings rule.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/YPrzMba6eM\\nLet’s not forgot how discriminatory that rule is, because women, ethnic minorities and those outside London are less likely to earn enough to live with their loved ones.\\n\\nThat’s squarely on Theresa May’s shoulders as well.\\nWhile we’re on discrimination, the High Court recently found one of the key planks of Theresa May’s hostile environment, the “right to rent” policy, caused landlords to discriminate against ethnic minority tenants when they otherwise would not. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/rrwDPFcwbG\\nThe 2012 family immigration rules also included the cruel effective closure of the immigration route for parents, forcing British citizens to move abroad to look after their elderly parents https://t.co/2wfhesqfXq\\nThere’s also what I can only describe as plain spitefulness to migrants. She seemed to be obsessed. Take the “go home” vans, for example. https://t.co/oaGJCeASOR\\nOr the “deport first, appeal later” law. You can only appeal after you’ve been removed, making it far harder to fight your case. The Supreme Court found it to be implemented unlawfully.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/052C9w9AbC\\nOr the English language testing scandal. Today, the National Audit Office found the Home Office presumed guilt and lacked expertise to verify cases. The Court of Appeal recently said the same.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/jmVhcpK7TX\\nShe took away rights of appeal for family visitors coming to the UK, preventing many from attending weddings, funerals, graduations and celebrations. \\n\\nSpiteful.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/rS4irVX017\\nShe did whatever she could to prevent child refugees in Calais or in the UK being reunited with their family members. \\n\\nCruel.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/nD2ZHi6Eb5\\nAlso on children, she ramped up the cost of citizenship applications for children, almost certainly denying many children the British citizenship to which they should have been entitled. https://t.co/7xCFbwAFW0 https://t.co/8XXvDuwyHz\\nThe cost of immigration and citizenship applications in general skyrocketed, forcing migrants to leave the UK, borrow, scrimp and save or go illegal \\n\\nhttps://t.co/F2aph2ovg1 https://t.co/8d5b4pgjL3\\nThe complexity of immigration law became infamous under Theresa May. Judge after judge has criticised the state of the law. Ordinary people simply cannot understand how the law affects them now. https://t.co/FhawMRoKcw\\nThe rules are such a mess now, due to changes in 2012, that an experienced immigration lawyer can barely get through an application for their own spouse.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/h8kmUHVfYb\\nShe introduced a cap on skilled migrants. That’s right, she stopped skilled migrants like doctors and IT specialists from coming to the UK even when they could not be recruited locally. \\n\\nNuts.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/wbBHtMIfFp\\nOne of her most lasting and damning legacies may be from forcing EU citizens to apply to the Home Office for permission to remain in the UK after Brexit, which will leave probably hundreds of thousands illegal after the deadline. https://t.co/ODaW3nPQ8a\\nThere was a huge increase in the number of EU citizens detained in the UK, due to Theresa May’s illegal policy of rounding up suspected homeless EU citizens https://t.co/Z3CbxhIbUG\\nEU citizens were also forced to complete additional paperwork to qualify for British citizenship from 2015 onwards. The added complexity caused many to be refused and loose the huge application fee. https://t.co/bEO2bF2S1Y\\nYet, despite all that, Theresa May never came close to meeting the net migration target she clung to. \\n\\nThe policies were never based on evidence.\\n\\nThey were never going to “work” on her terms. \\n\\nThe public was never going to be reassured.\\n\\nThey were little more than spite.\\nFinally, I leave you with The Cat. Theresa May falsely claimed a migrant was not deported because of a pet cat. It was nonsense but was used to justify harsh new deportation laws leading to the removal of even those who came to the UK as kids. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/uHvLOf3pBt',\n",
       " 'Thread: While Mueller is investigating stuff everybody already knows, Trump has committed at least 116 clear impeachable violations of the Constitution in full public view. 1/X\\n2. The Constitution was written a long time ago. Some of the words have fallen into disuse. In particular, \"emoluments\" is not a word one often encounters in everyday conversation.\\n3. But it\\'s really quite simple: it means pay for services, work, or position. Wages. Here: https://t.co/oQ2d7A59i6\\n4. Gain from employment or position.\\nPayment for work.\\nSalary, wages, fees, etc.\\nSee? It\\'s not that hard.\\n5. There are two places in the Constitution where the President is forbidden from receiving emoluments. From receiving money for his position as, say, owner of a hotel, golf course, or facility.\\n6. The best known one, strangely enough, is the \"foreign emoluments\" clause. The media (remember them? Think \"emails\".) mostly likes to talk about this one. It\\'s muddy.\\n7. It provides that no member of our federal government, implicitly including the President, may take any money \"of any  kind whatever\" for himself from any \"King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\\n8. So - not *that* muddy. When Saudi Princes stay at Trump International Hotel, money goes directly from their pockets into his privately owned bank account.\\nSo these weasels play this \"well if it\\'s not 👉 profit 👈 it\\'s not really an Emolument...\"\\n\"_of_any_kind_\".\\n9. So actually, yes, he violates the Constitution every time any agent of any foreign government checks out of his hotel, assuming they don\\'t walk the check.\\n10. But the other one is even easier, even more obvious, even more blatant, and involves more direct harm to the American people. He routinely transfers money out of the United States Treasury into his bank account, ignoring the Constitution.\\nHere is what it says: https://t.co/t1jZcNE3O7\\n8. This is the second paragraph down from where it says that only a natural born citizen can be President. The paragraph after the one that says if the President dies the Vice President takes over.\\n9. People, I have seen this referred to by our media (remember the media? Think \"emails.\" Yeah, them.) \\nI have seen this paragraph referred to as a \"technicality.\"\\n10. If it\\'s a technicality that the President has to be over 35 years old and a natural born citizen, if it\\'s a technicality that the Vice President is second in line, then it\\'s a technicality that he can\\'t rent golf carts to the Secret Service.\\n11. It is *NOT* a technicality. It is a FUNDAMENTAL PROVISION OF OUR CONSTITUTION.\\nTHE PRESIDENT IS FORBIDDEN FROM SELLING OR RENTING GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT or from any state. It absolutely could not be any plainer.\\n12. On 116 occasions, as of this writing, the President* has taken the Secret Service to his private properties and sold and rented goods to them. \\nThis is ABSOLUTELY, EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN under our Constitution. https://t.co/0Jn07RlxvI\\n13. Yes, I care that the Republicoup sold our country to Vladimir Putin for a bowl of pottage. I care a lot.\\nBut meanwhile, the crookedest man in America is scamming your money every weekend.\\nAnd the rules say he can\\'t.\\n14. It doesn\\'t say, \"he can trade his salary for all he can steal from the treasury.\"\\nHe doesn\\'t have to keep his salary. We have to pay it to him.\\nAnd whether he keeps it or not, HE CAN\\'T SELL OR RENT SHIT TO ANY AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL OR ANY STATE GOVERNMENT.\\n15. The language of the Constitution is as plain as the everyday language I use in my tweets. Old words are as meaningful as new ones.\\nNo wages, rents, fees, returns from property or position - owning a golf course is a \"position.\"\\n16. Two critical, Constitutionally provided entities are screwing you 7 days of every week, and have been since January 20th, 2017.\\nThe United States Congress, and the (allegedly) Free Press.\\n17. The rat bastard rented space in Trump Tower to the Secret Service while he was still President-Elect. So they could guard him and the First Bimbo. And that was legal. Nothing says the President-Elect can\\'t scam money out of the treasury.\\n18. But the minute he fouled that Bible with his filthy hand and took the Oath of Office he was in violation of the Constitution he just swore to uphold.\\n19. If our vaunted Checks and Balances worked - if the Republicoup Congress wasn\\'t corrupt and complicit - they would have begun Impeachment proceedings the following Monday.\\n20. Yes, literally.\\nSay they found incontrovertible proof on Saturday that Donald Trump was born in Kenya. Would they have blown it off, said, \"Oh, that\\'s just a technicality\"?\\nWell, this crooked Congress, maybe. &lt;sigh&gt;\\n21. Say they found out on Saturday afternoon that he\\'s a victim of progeria, not really 71 years old but actually 27. Does anybody think they\\'d have shrugged it off?\\n22.

There is this conceptual black hole in the genderists thinking in which they cannot acknowledge that sex could exist without gender, and which relies on maintaining that to abolish gender we must abolish sex... which is to say, they are the exact mirror\\nimage of the \\'conservative\\' position they purportedly oppose (sex=gender), and their thought *depends* on erasing, or misconstruing, the gender critical position (sex =/= gender).\\n4.

This is not entirely egregious, but won\\'t acknowledge that the next move made will, by abolishing sex, actually erase the distinction it purports to recognise here.\\n\\nBonus mandatory faux-sophisticate implication that \\'ppl who think sex exists are a bit simple aren\\'t they?\\' https://t.co/fZCpzZ7ygr\\n6. What I want to point to here is the constant error that is made by conflating the claim that sex does not necessarily determine gender, and the claim that sex does not historically determine gender. \\n\\nBeauvoir, along with *all* feminists, believes that sex-role are not https://t.co/DxAPKz4VF6\\na *necessary* feature of sex (we can talk about bimodal personality distributions, but the point is, that does not change the fact that the vast majority of gendering is social construction). That does not mean that the way gender has been constructed in patriarchy has *nothing*\\nto do with sex, and that we can just pretend that sex doesn\\'t exist and is socially irrelevant, because under these conditions, its fucking relevant. If you want to abolish sex-based oppression, you actually need to abolish sex-based oppression, not just play make-believe.\\n7. Okay, so now get to the intersex appropriation. I\\'ll spare you most of this, you all know the drill...\\n\\nBut it\\'s kind of interesting that she notes that although in this case sex is not a given, it is determined inside a biological framework... and then asks, what framework https://t.co/179S6RyZVx\\nis used to make that determination? Um. You just said. A biological one.\\n\\nThat is, a framework that aims to determine whether an individual has gone down the developmental pathway which would make them a member of the sperm-making class or the ova-making class. \\n\\nAnd no one is\\nsuggesting that that should lead to IGM. And to leverage the horror of historic IGM in order to support your ideology that sex is in some sense vastly indeterminate is morally egregious instrumentalization.\\n8. This is a totally classic Judy sleight-of-hand. At this point sex and gender start being run together and it\\'s implied they are both historically determined in the same kind of way. And viola! The determination of sex becomes both \\'constructed\\' and an \\'existential choice.\\' https://t.co/LkShghln6a\\n9. More fantastical bullshit about how gender ideology is a form of freedom and no one is imposing their views on anyone. \\n\\nGo and talk to the young women in universities right now who don\\'t agree with this crap and find out how much freedom they feel like they have. Hypocrite. https://t.co/CbZuzbE6VV\\n10. Back to erasing feminists and claiming anyone who opposes this is a conservative Christian. That\\'s right Judy, radical lesbian feminists are really pro-life and think homosexuality is a sin. We have no problem with how people perform their gender. It just doesn\\'t change sex. https://t.co/gVX3aDNQh5\\n11. No, we have no problem with teaching people about the diversity of how people can live a \\'spectrum of gendered lives.\\' We have a problem with teaching people that that means they are in the wrong body and their bodies need to be changed to match their \\'gender.\\' We have a https://t.co/uIy1VB4S4T\\na problem with spreading a thought system which leads gender non conforming kids into a lifetime of possibly unnecessary medicalization. And we have a problem with essentialising gender, which you should also have, if you had a shred of intellectual honesty left in you.\\n12. Having entirely failed to address any of the substantive issues or the persistent authoritarianism I\\'m now going to finish with a load more disingenuous BS about \\'freedom\\' and \\'diversity\\' and \\'possibility\\' and \\'complexity\\' which all sounds lovely and is fucking meaningless. https://t.co/w9394lpOfb\\nThank you and good night.\\n\\n*UGH*\\n\\n&lt;Ends&gt; https://t.co/ks0THVw1NV',\n",

       " '1. I am about to blow your minds with this thread. It is massive. You will want to pay VERY close attention. The Senate Intelligence Committee released a lot of documents last week and I touched upon this but didn\\'t put two and two together until now.\\n2. There is a lawsuit ongoing right now in the UK. Orbis and Steele are being sued by Aleksej Gubarev, Webzilla, and XBT based off of memos in the dossier.\\n3. We know that McCain received the dossier via David Kramer back in November of 2016, and then he handed it over to the FBI. I just chose a random article to have it out of his own mouth.  https://t.co/2slRiQDBaB https://t.co/auBJZnbwV0\\n4. We know that during this time, he met with Sir Andrew Wood (former UK diplomat) to receive it. https://t.co/bGdNPWmzaR The \"Senator\" referenced, is John McCain. https://t.co/PGoEFYQz2J\\n5. So we know that McCain was involved with Fusion GPS and Steele/Orbis for what we will now call the \"pre-election\" dossier. But, although alluded to several times, we also now have in our possession a memo written by Steele in DECEMBER. AFTER the election.\\n6. When the Senate released their docs the other day, inside was a full copy of the dossier, including the December memo, as well as some of the responses written by Orbis/Steele in the lawsuit. Let\\'s first examine the Memo. My gosh hold on to your hats folks...\\n7. Here is the memo. This memo basically states, that Cohen, in Prague, made cash payments to Russian FSB connected hackers to target the DNC and other connected players. https://t.co/i7IDTNgLpJ\\n8. In this part here, they cover \"Guccifer 2.0\". https://t.co/oCWUMlPveA\\n9. In this part, they cover the phishing and malware that the establishment contends targeted members of the DNC and Podesta: https://t.co/N7rvtNfmR3\\n10. The problem?? MICHAEL COHEN HAS NEVER BEEN TO PRAGUE. It was debunked back after the dossier was released, when Cohen provided his passport, and receipts to prove he wasn\\'t in Prague at the time of this report, or EVER. https://t.co/5zsoV8gYfN https://t.co/kGbcZ3Uikk\\n11. We all scratched our heads a few weeks ago, in mid April, when the \"Cohen in Prague\" story was trotted out again in front of the media. Why would they be bringing this up again, with such fervor? Oh I know why! Part II: https://t.co/SgDYquc2tU\\n12. The media was trying to get in front of this story, because of the massive implications it has. We learn in this lawsuit (included in what the Senate Intel Committee dropped) that McCain received this memo, along with a SENIOR LEVEL UK INTELLIGENCE official.\\n13. Lets go through the lawsuit together, and I will tie everything up in a moment. Kramer asked that McCain be briefed with anything further in re: to Russian interference in the election. https://t.co/GHcdLbXXQK\\n14. This entire page needs to be read- remember this is Orbis/Steele answering. It states here the Dec memo was given to McCain through Fusion, and then Kramer, encrypted- three hands to get this to him-- https://t.co/qau930k1Fa\\n15. \"We had to send this along because it was important. They should have known they shouldn\\'t publish it or share it\" https://t.co/JiEmobLnAw\\n16. Here, they basically say that Fusion should have known not to disperse the December memo under a previous NDA (aka- Fusion may have leaked it) https://t.co/Ip6EiefgJo\\n17. \"We were providing the December memo to McCain and Kramer under their official capacity- that is how it was presented to us\" https://t.co/9x7N5ouMoK\\n18. This is interesting, because it states that this intelligence was delivered to Steele without him even asking for it. The question? Who brought it to him. I would be speculating if I answered that question, so I am going to wait until the end to do that. https://t.co/iKEfAgENIL\\n19. And finally, the big enchilada, they couldn\\'t even PROVE the contents of the memo were true! So again, we have unverified information, which was provided to McCain and Kramer through FusionGPS in December, and was then used for something amazing. LOOK AT THIS. https://t.co/UCRXFPLsLL\\n20. Remember the contents of the memo? Russian and \"Romanian\" hacking financed by Cohen? Is it sheer coincidence that Crowdstrike happened to come out in December with their \"proof\" that Russia did the hacking, along with some of the language found in this memo?\\n21. Well it did. Take a look. https://t.co/MQr8DYgrPl https://t.co/ZCEsBWueER\\n22. It appears that Crowdstrike obtained this memo, either via Fusion GPS (as insinuated in the lawsuit, by Orbis) or via McCain, and then used this memo as the foundation for the charges that \"Russia hacked the DNC\".https://t.co/Uf6iqp4o5g https://t.co/Bohz3AhreV\\n23. As a matter of fact, not two weeks later, the official intelligence report concluding the Russian hacking was released. Was it all based on this unverified, now provably false, intelligence memo which was handed to Steele unprovoked?\\n\\nhttps://t.co/GyMLHBx6Tl\\n24. One more: https://t.co/HuOCejvpj1 https://t.co/Pi8KQrYfk0\\n25. So it appears, that select folks in the IC, who had used the unverified dossier already to obtain FISA warrants, etc, via Fusion and McCain/Kramer, used this bogus December memo as the proof that the hacking was done by Russia, and then someone passed it on to Crowdstrike...\\n26. My question is, who provided the intelligence to Steele? What did McCain have to do with it? Did Fusion provide it to Crowdstrike? Did they even ANALYZE the DNC Servers? did the IC report use this memo as its basis?? IS THIS ALL THEY HAD!?!?!?!\\n27. Here is a video report. Please share and add comments below. https://t.co/QYP3ZMjVPv\\nAND! It makes it worse that they KNOW THIS in the Senate Intel Committee and they STILL said that there was Russian interference. That committee is biased, conflicted, and useless. First Warner, then Jones (Feinstein) and now this? Wow.',\n",
       " \"Quick, brief refresher on my understanding of how we got here: \\n\\n1. During 2016 primaries, Trump knows Obama/HRC did lots of sweet under the table deals with Russians/Iranians.  To troll them, he starts bragging how he's going to be Putin's BFF once he's elected.\\n2. Hillary &amp; her team hatch a dirty trick to play on Trump: they'll hire an political communications shop named FUSION GPS to create what will be passed off as a collection of intelligence reports 'proving' Trump &amp; his campaign team are in the pocket of the Russians.\\n3. A Fusion GPS team made up of Glenn Simpson, Nellie Ohr, Mary Jacoby [Simpson's spouse] and former MI6 spy Christopher Steele, begins producing the fiction that later becomes known as 'the Steele dossier'.\\n4. In these fake intel report summaries, the Fusion team center their creative writing around several people involved in Trump's campaign: Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\\n5. The best part of this dirty trick is the willing participation of many Obama holdover/Hillary sycophants sprinkled throughout the federal LEO/IC agencies only too willing to help launder this dossier &amp; pretend it's an intel product, not fiction from a political comms shop.\\n6. Simultaneously the dossier begins to have key details in it leaked to media allies such as David Corn of Mother Jones, strategic leaks that immediately place Carter Page and Paul Manafort under suspicion of being Russian agents.\\n7. While these strategic leaks are happening, people such as Sen. John McCain and Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie are being used to 'discover' the dossier &amp; bring it to the attention of the FBI, as well as to the attention of the Hillary campaign itself.\\n8. Thanks to the laundering of the dossier, the HRC campaign now has plausible deniability. Fed LEO/IC agencies are 'finding' the dossier on their own [wink wink!] &amp; reporters are 'finding' gov't sources who are 'independently' verifying the dossier by leaking it to them [wink!]\\n9. While that was going on, to give the Steele Dossier more credibility, Obama/Hillary sycophants inside the LEO/IC began actually SENDING spies to try to entrap Trump campaign staff. Carter Page, G. Papadopoulos &amp; others are targeted for fake 'recruitment' by 'Russians'.\\n10. While Page &amp; Papadopoulos are being set up by IC spies trying to entrap them, the plotters inside the LEO/IC agencies go to the FISA Court &amp; draw up a warrant to spy on Carter Page using the fake dossier as intel product. Reportedly, 1st warrant attempt is denied.\\n11. But they persisted! A subsequent warrant attempt on Page is granted. The plotters now have legal authority to begin intercepting all of the Trump campaign's electronic comms [EC's].\\n12. The two pronged approach appears to be paying off. They have strategic leaks in the media keeping Trump's campaign under constant suspicion of being a Russian subsidiary while fed. IC/LEO agents are furiously spying on them trying to find dirt to derail Trump's candidacy.\\n13.  AND IT DIDN'T MATTER. Hillary runs an inept campaign, Trump wins anyway. \\n\\nNow the real fun starts. https://t.co/Fmh8Z2eclm\\n14. Every action taken by the plotters prior to election day 2016 was based on Hillary winning. The Steele dossier was NEVER supposed to be thoroughly examined. It's careful laundering was to provide an excuse for leaks &amp; investigations. It CAN'T stand up to scrutiny.\\n15. So after this election disaster, the plotters now have to do two things: \\n\\na.  they have to keep HIDING their investigation into the Trump campaign [which they'd concealed from Congressional oversight] so they can find something to impeach him with.\\n16. and while doing that they must also\\n\\nb. they have to hide the real facts about where the Steele dossier came from and who paid for it.\\n17. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PLOTTERS, Democrats in Congress like Jerrold Nadler and Elijah Cummings were VERY VERY ANGRY at then-FBI Director James Comey for reopening the Clinton Email investigation after the Weiner laptop was discovered with 300,000 new HRC-related emails on it. https://t.co/LKRsQmiP6L\\n18. See, top Dems in Congress like Cummings &amp; Nadler were *convinced* Comey's reopening of that HRC email investigation played a huge part in Hillary's losing the election to Trump. \\n\\nSo they DEMAND an investigation by the DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into this.\\n19.  On Jan. 12, 2017, DOJ IG Horowitz GRANTS DEMOCRATS WHAT THEY WANTED.  He announces a review of the DOJ/FBI's handling of matters prior to the 2016 Presidential election [which includes the Hillary Email investigation]. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/U2IN69fy9k https://t.co/OT7W2ySMl5\\n20. During the course of his review of the investigations/actions the DOJ/FBI was engaged in leading up to the 2016 election, here's what Horowitz discovers: \\n\\nDespite the best efforts of the plotters to hide it, he discovers the truth about the Steele dossier.\\n21. HOROWITZ is the one who discovers the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the creation of the Steele dossier by tracking the funding for it through the law firm Perkins Coie.\\n22. While tracing the origins of the Steele Dossier &amp; how it was laundered through fed. LEO/IC agents misrepresenting it - even in FISA warrants! - Horowitz *also* happens upon the text messages on the official FBI phones of the lead agent in 'Crossfire Hurricane': Peter Strzok.\\n23. While tracking down the origins/laundering of the bogus Steele Dossier, &amp; perusing the unbelievably juvenile text messages of Strzok/Page, Horowitz &amp; his team of investigators also uncover a plethora of strategic leaking by Andrew McCabe, among others.\\n24. So here's what Horowitz has been tipping Congress off to since October 2017, when he first began rolling out all the evidence of what he'd found since he began his investigation on Jan 12, 2017:\\n25. \\n\\na. Bogus Steele dossier &amp; how it was created, paid for, laundered\\nb. Abuse of the FISA court system to start investigations based on it\\nc. Strategic leaks in media to 'back up' the dossier by top FBI/DOJ officials\\nd. Alteration of official DOJ/FBI records\\n26. Horowitz released his report on McCabe first, which led to McCabe's being terminated. Several weeks ago he released the MYE report on Clinton Democrats were so hot to get that referred 5 people to the FBI OPR for pro-Clinton bias.\\n\\nUp next? The FISA Abuse/Trump Spying report\\n27.

       " 'Let\\'s just NAIL THIS shall we?   Does the UK get value for money from the EU?\\n\\n\"We pay in more than we get back\" cry the Brexiteers... \\n\\n\"the UK could lose one hundred billion pounds from the economy and a million unemployed\" replies the CBI.   \\n\\nSo lets take a look at the FACTs https://t.co/pcSsErL20k\\n2/ CASH IN AND CASH OUT\\nAccording to Page 40 of Her Majesties Treasury report at December 2015 entitled “European Union Finances 2015”, the UKs contribution to the European Union (our ‘membership fee’) that Brexiteers tell us we could *save* and spend on building new hospitals,\\n3/ schools and the like is £12.36 billion in 2015.  *This figure is calculated as a percentage of Gross National Income, or GNI.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom received an ‘instant rebate’ of £4.86 billion. (not sent to the EU)\\n4/  This is calculated before we make any payment at all which means that the cash amount that we sent to Brussels last year was just £7.5 billion.   To put this in perspective, the Department for Communities and Local Government statistical dataset of December 3rd 2015,\\n5/  there are 27.4 million households in the UK.\\n\\nThe UK cash contribution therefore is £273 per household per year, or using an average of 2.34 people per household (DCLG figures) £116.97 per person.\\n\\nSo starting with £7.5 billion, lets look at some of what we get back:\\n6/ UK Farmers receive direct payments of just under £4 billion through the Common Agricultural Policy and Agriculture funding.\\n\\nThe European Social Fund which support charities across the UK with a variety of grants, and the UK Cohesion Fund that funds various infrastructure\\n7/ developments in the UK contribute around £1.96 billion (total of £11.8bn between 2014 and 2020).\\n\\nAnd a further £108 million is paid back to the UK in grants towards a number of other projects.\\n8/ So from the £7.5bn we pay, we get back around £6bn in direct cash payments, leaving a net cash difference of £1.5 billion per year.\\n9/ EU MEMBERSHIP EFFECT ON UK GDP\\nOf course, as EU members we are able to access the European Single Market which means we are able to sell unlimited products, and services made in the UK totally free of tariffs and duties.\\n10/ This means that the UK can import parts and raw materials relatively cheaply keep cost of production low and it also means that UK made goods are competitively priced in the largest bloc of customers on the planet.\\n11/ Combined, this makes the UK a great destination for UK and foreign manufacturers to invest and create British jobs, and help build the UK economy.   Without this unlimited free trade, it is guaranteed that investment in the UK economy would slow down.\\n12/ I’ve looked at some of the contributors to UK GDP.  I have made some assumptions that you should be aware of:  Firstly, the figures here are not the TOTAL contribution to the UK economy of each sector, but I have pared it back substantially and am only including the portion\\n13/  of GDP that is related to our EU membership.   For example, it is likely that cars will still be made in the UK, but not as many as today if we leave.\\n14/ Automotive sector: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and KPMG carried out extensive analysis of the UKs automotive sector.  Their conclusions from the final report entitled “An economic assessment of the UKs automotive industry with the European Union” are\\n15/ are that over 700,000 people in Britain are employed in the automotive sector, and the total contribution to the UK economy is in excess of £60 billion in 2013/14.  One example is Nissan in Sunderland who build 500,000 cars per year only sell 19% of their production in the UK\\n16/ For the contribution to the UK economy from the EU, I’ve deducted just 40% from the total GDP contribution here:\\n\\nThe UK automotive sector makes cars in the UK for the EU £36.3 billion per year.\\n17/ According to the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) report in conjunction with Deloittes, inward travel on business from other EU countries £0.95bn per year. (not tourists, just business).\\n18/ The UK Agri-Food sector employs over 3.5 million people in the UK and contributes over £103 billion in GVA to the UK economy in 2013.  Of this a significant proportion is exported all around the globe – I have used a figure here of £70.15bn per year.\\n19/ TheCityUK report “A practitioners guide to Brexit: exploring its consequences and alternatives to EU membership suggests that the UK financial and related services sector employs 2.2m people in the UK and of a total GDP contribution to UK GDP of £66bn in 2014/15.\\n20/ Exports to other EU countries from this sector were far in excess of the £19.7bn per year figure I am using.\\n\\nJust between those 4 sectors UK GDP is enhanced by £127.1 billion each year.\\n21/ Remembering that our net cash contribution to the EU was just £1.5 billion, and the UK economy benefits from just those four sectors by £127.1 billion, you would think that was already a pretty good deal eh?\\n\\nHowever, the benefits continue...\\n22/ FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT\\nAs a result of the UKs membership of the EU, we hold over one trillion pounds of money in UK bank deposits from the other 27 EU countries – it is impossible to think that they would leave all that here if we vote to Leave.\\n23/ Lets assume that we lost just 17% of that figure – that would be a loss of £170 billion out of the UK banking sector (around half the amount that UK Government bailed out the banks back in 2009).\\n24/ By 2014, the UK received £1,065 billion of foreign investment into the UK economy from countries all around the world.  A large portion of this is to build products in the UK to sell tariff free into the EU.\\n25/ A HUGE benefit to the UK of remaining members of the EU.  Of course we would not lose all that investment, but lets say that other EU countries withheld 40% their investment from the UK and put that money to use elsewhere in the EU.....  continued in next thread.....\\n26/ that would be loss of around £170.1 billion out of the UK economy.   If other countries around the world reduced their inward investment into the UK by 25%, that is further loss to the UK economy of another £150 billion.\\n27/ So the UK pays net £1.5 billion a year and we get back at least £127.1 billion into GDP from trade, and a further £320.1 billion in EU related FDI…. creating UK jobs.\\n\\nSo far that’s an annual benefit to the UK economy overall of £128.6 billion.\\n28/28 And Brexiteers continue to cry about our \\'membership fee\\'?   They just dont understand whats going on around them or where their jobs came from!',\n",
       " '1) My latest @EpochTimes\\n\\nTracing the Origins of Congressional Democrats\\' \\'Obstruction\\' Strategy\\nhttps://t.co/XFwkvv3LV1\\n2) Note: This post owes a thanks &amp; h/t to @Joestradamus91\\n\\nAlso a nod &amp; h/t to @willchamberlain\\n\\nLinks to articles from both will follow.\\n\\nThanks to @JasperFakkert for all his suggestions &amp; edit work on this one.\\n3) Efforts by Democrat members of Congress to advance the narrative that Trump ‘obstructed justice’ have now replaced the disproven claims of Trump-Russia collusion.\\n\\nHowever, the public narrative of obstruction actually originated prior to Mueller\\'s Report.\\n4) Less than 6-months after Mueller’s appointment—on October 10, 2017—the Brookings Institution published a report titled “Presidential Obstruction of Justice: The Case of Donald J. Trump,” which outlined a strategy whereby Mueller could refer his obstruction findings to Congress\\n5) Notably, two of the authors of the Brookings report were later retained by Rep. Jerry Nadler, House Judiciary Committee Chairman, on a consulting basis as special oversight counsels to the Democrat Majority Staff.\\n6) It was initially believed that the primary focus of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation centered around allegations of collusion, however, the release of Mueller’s report makes clear that substantial resources were dedicated to investigating potential obstruction charges.\\n7) The Mueller report stated that in regards to obstruction, several statutes could apply - including 1503 and 1505 - but the special counsel chose to focus primarily on Section 1512.\\n\\nMueller’s report dedicates a full section to defending the use of Section 1512.\\n8) Among the first mentions suggesting the use of Section 1512 was a June 2, 2017 article by the website Lawfare.\\n\\nThe article was written approximately two weeks after Mueller was first appointed as special counsel.\\nhttps://t.co/fbwQPpuKZZ\\n9) Wittes, himself a Senior Fellow at Brookings, was also the author of an article in October 2016 that discussed the need for an “insurance policy,” which according to Wittes was a “cross-ideological network of lawyers and philanthropists” dedicated to fighting Trump in court.\\n10) It wasn’t just Lawfare that had focused its attention on Section 1512.\\n\\nThe Brookings report, which was brought to my attention and initially covered in an article by @Joestradamus91, made Section 1512 a primary focus from an early start.\\nhttps://t.co/IsGdMlCtrt\\n11) It is unclear whether the Brookings Institute report was part of this effort suggested by Wittes, who is also a Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution.\\n12) Brookings produced its first 108 page report, authored by Barry Berke, Noah Bookbinder and Norman Eisen on Oct. 10, 2017.\\n\\nThey followed up with a 177 page 2nd Edition on Aug. 22, 2018 which also came with a lengthy 200 page appendix.\\nhttps://t.co/M46I41UnRh\\n13) In the 2nd Edition, the Brookings report dedicated an entire section solely to exploring the use of Section 1512—and as they note in their report, they did so specifically because 1512 could be applied towards “obstruction” of potential and possible future proceedings.\\n14) On page 148, the Brookings report discusses the issue of referring the Mueller report directly to Congress: https://t.co/47JPrXGKGs\\n15) Although the Brookings report strives to make its case regarding congressional referral, at each turn it is forced to acknowledge that any referral option would be subject to the authority and oversight of then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\\n16) Another problem exists.\\n\\n@realDonaldTrump was told on three separate occasions by Dir Comey that he was not personally under investigation by the FBI.\\n\\nTherefore, Trump could not obstruct an investigation of himself if he didn\\'t know there was an investigation to begin with.\\n17) Regarding claims that President Trump might have obstructed an investigation into individuals other than himself, there would need to be a rationalization against presidential pardon authority.\\n18) On Feb. 12, 2019, Nadler announced that two of the Brookings report authors, Eisen and Berke, had been retained as special oversight counsels to the Democrat Majority Staff.\\n\\nThey were appointed in advance of the April 18 release of the Mueller report.\\nhttps://t.co/GWnWRfGJ2w\\n19) It appears that Nadler had intended for Eisen and Burke to lead a hoped-for May 2 questioning of AG Barr personally.\\n\\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) commented on Barr’s absence and Berke\\'s &amp; Eisen\\'s planned involvement during an impromptu press conference on May 2: https://t.co/TlFAzCJmmA\\n20) Section 1512 is a rather obscure statute, a fact inadvertently highlighted in two separate letters sent by President Trump’s lawyers to SC Mueller.\\n\\nSection 1505, the standard for obstruction, is mentioned in the letters 39 times. Section 1512 is not mentioned once.\\n21) But apparently, there was one individual who had foreseen its possible use.\\n\\nOn June 8, 2018, William Barr, now the Attorney General but then a lawyer in private practice, sent a lengthy memo to DAG Rosenstein and AAG Steve Engel.\\nhttps://t.co/DXqM7uz4WO\\n22) Barr’s memo noted “It appears Mueller\\'s team is investigating a possible case of \"obstruction\" by the President.\\n\\nUnlike the president’s lawyers, Barr predicted the use of Section 1512, noting, “It appears Mueller is relying on 18 U.S.C. § 1512.\\n23) This quiet battle between Mueller and Barr over the use of Section 1512 was first highlighted in an excellent article by Will Chamberlain of Human Events.\\nhttps://t.co/KPUz3cPbk6\\n24) Barr appeared alarmed by the liberal application of Section 1512, observing that “any discretionary act by a President that influences a proceeding can become the subject of a criminal grand jury investigation, probing whether the President acted with an improper motive.”\\n25) Barr noted the spiralling outcomes that could come from use of the statute:\\n\\n“Simply by giving direction on a case, or class of cases, an official opens himself to the charge that he has acted with an \"improper\" motive and thus becomes subject to a criminal investigation.”\\n26) Mueller ultimately failed to provide a determination on obstruction directly, leaving the decision up to AG Barr, who along with then-Deputy AG Rosenstein, ruled that there was no obstruction by the president.\\n27) Barr said that he and Rosenstein did not agree with much of the legal analysis contained in the report and felt it represented the “views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law.”\\n28) Barr concluded:\\n\\n“The report itself points out that one of the likely motivations here was the president’s frustration with Comey saying something publicly and saying a different thing privately, and refusing to correct the record.”\\n\\n/End',\n",
       " 'AMERICA, WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE.\\n \\nYesterday, as Trump was ranting about “shithole countries,” I was in a county courthouse in Georgia looking at a death certificate for a black man who died in 1930. I watched the courthouse employees’ faces... 1/\\nclosely as they read the cause of death “Unlawful act.” Their confused looks confirmed what I suspected; they had never seen such a vague description listed as a cause of death. They clearly did not know about the incident that occurred there 88 years before, even though it 2/\\nhad been the focus of national news for weeks back in 1930. “It was a lynching” I explained, pointing to the word scribbled in parenthesis on the document. I had them pull another death certificate; this one for a white 16 year-old girl who had died one day prior to the man.  3/\\nHer cause of death was listed as “Murder.” The man was accused of raping &amp; murdering the girl the day before. He had fled into the woods after locals spotted him on the road not far away from her body. The sheriff arrived quickly &amp; immediately called for assistance from... 4/\\nneighboring law enforcement agencies. They began tracking him as soon as dogs arrived; first, along a creek through the woods, then across fields &amp; through more woods. It continued for eighteen hours, with more &amp; more men joining in from other counties, until the track ended 5/\\nat a cabin nearly 20 miles away. The posse, which had grown to nearly one thousand by that time, quickly surrounded the house. The owner told the sheriff that the suspect was not there. However, when the sheriff &amp; two deputies searched it, they discovered him hiding in the 6/\\nkitchen. The posse waited restlessly outside as the sheriff questioned the suspect. The restlessness quickly transformed the men from a posse into a mob. They rushed into the cabin &amp; grabbed the owner, intending to “teach him a lesson” for sheltering the suspect. Fortunately 7/\\nthe sheriff was able to calm them down. Unfortunately, their focus turned to the suspect. The heavily armed mob told the sheriff that he could maintain custody of the suspect, but instead of the county jail, they would be taking him to where the girl’s body was found. He was 8/\\nordered to follow a truck loaded with 15 armed men. Another 75 to 100 cars &amp; trucks followed closely behind the sheriff. When the caravan reached the city limits, the sheriff – knowing that the mob likely intended to lynch his suspect – attempted to get away when the lead... 9/\\ntruck made a turn. Dozens of shots were fired, disabling the sheriff\\'s car. The sheriff, deputies &amp; suspect were forced into another vehicle &amp; transported to mob’s intended destination. Upon arrival, the suspect was chained to a tree. A crowd of more than a thousand, ... 10/\\nincluding women &amp; children, watched as his fingers and toes were removed, “joint by joint.” A pole was jabbed into his mouth when he began to scream. It was removed only long enough to pull his teeth with pliers. More torture, to gruesome to describe, took place. In total, 11/\\nit lasted for more than an hour. He was still alive when the mob piled sticks &amp; logs under him, poured gas on &amp; ignited the fire. Several men fired their weapons at pointblank range. The body was left there for the day. Thousands of people “rode out to see the spectacle.” 12/\\nTwelve hours later, at sunset, the sheriff &amp; deputies removed &amp; buried the body. Details of the lynching were published in America’s newspapers from coast to coast. Despite an investigation, which included convening a grand jury, no one was ever charged. The reason I ... 13/\\ndecided to tweet about this is because of what happened next… not back in 1930, but YESTERDAY, both in that Georgia courthouse and in the White House. After I concluded providing them with the details, one employee nodded approvingly, “They knew how to 14/\\nhandle things back then.” “Good for them,” said another. The 1st began to expound on their opinion; \"You know, it\\'s about damn time we stopped being afraid to-\" when a black women walked into the office. The employee cheerfully greeted the lady with familiarity \"Hey, Betty.\" 15/\\nI watched as they exchanged pleasantries. The employees\\' tones &amp; demeanor had completely changed. It was both astonishing &amp; disturbing. It was as if I was watching a performance, done for an audience of one; Betty. I had the urge to shout, \"Don\\'t believe it Betty! It\\'s just 16/\\nan act! RUN!\" But of course I just stood there, for just long enough to not seem rude. Having concluded my business, I thanked them &amp; left. I started the car &amp; by habit, turned on the radio just in time to hear about Trump’s “shithole” remarks. I cringed. There was no doubt 17/\\nin my mind where the “It’s about damn time we stopped being afraid to-” remark was headed had the black lady not walked in at that time. I had heard that tone &amp; seen that sneer too many times before. Like when I was 9 years-old, &amp; a neighbor jubilantly exclaimed \"Somebody - 18/\\nfinally killed that nigger!\" The \\'somebody\\' he was referring to turned out to be James Earl Ray &amp; the \\'nigger\\' was Martin Luther King Jr. That was the day, the exact minute, when I realized how truly evil racism was. Yes, I had seen news stories showing protesters being - 19/\\nknocked down with fire hoses, attacked by dogs &amp; beat with clubs, but that was on TV, somewhere else far away. Seeing Farmer Jekyll transform into the demented Farmer Hyde right in front of me was traumatic. It scared the hell out of me &amp; I never forgot it. I never - 20/\\nrespected him again. I saw &amp; heard that same deep hatred in that courthouse yesterday and I felt that same sickness gnawing at my soul as it did on that terrible day in 1968. Listening to the news about Trump on the way home, I recalled other racist things he has said &amp; done. 21/\\nI also remembered how, during Obama\\'s presidency, Republicans had made absurd &amp; baseless claims that Obama was not only not a Christian; he was a Muslim &amp; a racist, intent on destroying America by dividing us. And look at those same Republicans today; practically worshiping 22/\\na pathetic excuse for a man who is doing exactly what they falsely accused Obama of doing. People like those I saw yesterday, who make up Trump’s base, key off of every hateful ignorant word Trump spits out, whether it’s through his foul mouth or by applying his pudgy little 23/\\nfingers to a keypad. And all it would take to send them into an uncontrollable rage is for Donald Trump to say something just as their inner hatred hits the boiling point. Donald Trump personifies everything that is WRONG with America today. He is greedy. He is a misogynist. 24/\\nDonald Trump is a bigot. He is a hypocrite, both religiously &amp; patriotically. He is hateful. Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump is un-American. Donald Trump has not only broken his oath &amp; trampled on our Constitution, he has pillaged &amp; profiteered like a pirate, all 25/\\nunder the protection of the GOP. Donald Trump has removed the name of Lincoln from the Republican party &amp; replaced it with his own. Donald Trump is that mob from 1930. Donald Trump will NEVER be my president. I am #TheResistance! #StrongerTogether #VoteBlue2018 #FireTheGOP 26/26\\n👉Post-tweet👈I\\'ve tried to respond to questions/criticisms, but I can\\'t keep up. The most frequent was that I SHOULD have \"called them out\" (courthouse employees) or \"reported\" them. Keep in mind that there is much more to this story than I\\'ve posted here. It is not over. PT1\\nThe focus of this is about something much bigger &amp; I will more than likely have to review more records in that office. There\\'s more than enough time to deal with them. The 2nd thing was that I should have \"warned\" Betty. Get real, folks. She was in no danger &amp; there\\'s NOTHING PT2\\nthat 👉I👈can \"teach\" a middle-aged black woman about spotting racists in her own hometown. In fact, Betty is the one that can teach me as well as a few others in this thread.',\n",

What follows is my feeble attempt to make sense of both the timeline of event and the actual information thus far publicly available. The media’s coverage has had the effect of muddying already murky waters.\\n3. Mueller’s SC was composed of many left leaning individuals, many who contributed to Hillary &amp; Obama’s campaign. The group has been under intense focus over last few weeks. I expect more negative information to unravel about this group in next few weeks\\nhttps://t.co/ZLFbAMwDO4\\n4. One focus of SC is the Trump-Russia or Steele dossier or the dossier as I will call it. In Oct 2015, during Republican primary The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump.\\n5. Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, The Free Beacon stopped funding this research\\n6. In April 2016, the investigation contract and funding were taken over by Marc Elias, a partner in Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie. Elias was the attorney of record for the DNC and the Clinton presidential campaign. (Yes, its not a typo.)\\n7. In total, Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, $168,000 from this payment was paid to Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, and used by them to produce the dossier.\\nhttps://t.co/9KyQek6QXU\\n8. June 2016, after DNC website hack, Fusion GPS hired Orbis to look into Russian connections. The investigation was undertaken by Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele, retired British MI6 officer with expertise in Russian matters.\\n9. He described the finding seriously troubling evidence that he decided to share it with the FBI in July 2016, without permission of Fusion GPS. Steele delivered his report as a series of two- or three-page memos, starting in June 2016 and continuing through December.\\n10. He continued his investigation even after the Democratic client stopped paying for it following Trump\\'s election. In October 2016, Steele compiled 33 pages and passed his findings to a reporter from Mother Jones magazine.\\nhttps://t.co/D2NgxeMw09\\n11. Shortly after presidential election, John McCain met with former British ambassador to Moscow Andrew Wood who vouched for Steele\\'s professionalism and integrity.\\n12.

Steele was familiar to the FBI, they had hired him to help a U.S. inquiry into alleged corruption in the world soccer organization FIFA. \\nhttps://t.co/SNJnSrodTK\\n14. January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump included allegations that Russian operatives possess compromising personal and financial information about Trump.\\n15. Following the CNN report, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier that it said was the basis of the briefing, including unverified claims that Russian operatives had collected \"embarrassing material\" involving Trump that could be used to blackmail him.\\n16. January 2017, Comey testified to Congress confirming Russian interference in 2016 election and confirmed ongoing investigation although he refused to comment on the Trump organization.\\n17. In March 2017 Comey finally confirmed that FBI was investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia and refuted Trump’s allegation that Obama administration that Obama Govt wiretapped him.\\nhttps://t.co/rNyO3L5jlv\\n18.

Boy, did the fairweather friends come out in force when he did that.\\n(11)  By now I had learned to stop and think before reacting, and to do my own research, with help from trusted commentators. Dealing with the naysayers was becoming easy, and even fun.\\n(12)  I knew Trump wouldn\\'t just give DACA recipients and their extended families amnesty, and certainly not without establishing such extensive measures and timeframes to make it all but impossible for people to obtain citizenship this way.\\n(13) I still trust him to do the best thing for Americans first on this matter. So seeing \"No DACA\" and \"No Amnesty\" was a dead giveaway as to whether someone was on my wavelength or not.\\n(14) When POTUS was leading the Tax Bill process in November and December 2017, there were confused worriers then, too. Occasionally I would give information to the nice ones; and troll the unpleasant ones, as if I was a cat repeatedly tossing a half dead mouse in the air.\\n(15)  I will never forget the remarks made and photos taken after that bill was signed. I realized Hatch, McConnell and even Ryan patently weren\\'t as determined to abuse GOP voters as the fairweather friends had convinced me they were in 2016.\\n(16)  Even Bob Corker smiled when someone thanked Trump for his part in the tax bill. I have the screenshot. All 50 GOP Senators in DC voted for it. Only McCain didn\\'t, since he was in Arizona. \\n\\nBut still the naysayers deny that some of them can ever do anything right.\\n(17) On December 12, Roy Moore lost the ALSen race. The usual suspects had been on his side, even in the primary when Trump had clearly preferred Luther Strange.\\n(18) Not enough AL GOP voters listened to Trump and trusted his judgment. End of story. I blocked an enormous number of people because of their irrational screeching about Roy Moore. Oh well.\\n(19) Other events occurred that reinforced my views about these self-proclaimed sometime Trump \"supporters.\" In short, they are either mistaken about the facts or, more likely, were never Trump supporters. (Continued)\\n(20) They come in various flavors, foreign and domestic. Some are literally Russian (you can tell by the broken English), or Russian-funded, or Russian-sympathetic.\\n(21) Russia wants to stoke division in the USA. If you don\\'t get that, then you clearly haven\\'t been paying attention lately, or learned the history Europe in the last 102 years. I\\'m not your research assistant so at this point you\\'ll need to find the information yourself.\\n(22) It\\'s actually easy to spot these fake Twitter accounts using a number of variables you can see on their profiles. A low follower count is the most obvious one, but occasionally you see them with &gt;1,000.\\n(23) The American public figures who whine, such as Laura Ingraham (who has even dined at Mar-a-Lago during Trump\\'s Presidency), are motivated by self interest. Playing the part of a contrarian garners TV ratings, online clicks, and book sales for them.\\n(24)  I\\'m no public figure, but I can write.  As I could never sell out my beliefs or be controlled by a boss or funder, I prefer to work for free. This is the best hobby ever.\\n(25) This week I\\'ve written about the budget bill several times, in the courteous, reasonable way I do for good-faith readers. Suffice to say, I understand and support Trump signing the bill. He has weighed the pros and cons, with what he knows (which is more than we do).\\n(26) His oath of office places protecting Americans and America as his highest priority. Military defense is not negotiable. Also, the bill only lasts for 6 months! And he can choose not to use all of the allowed budget in many of the line items, too.\\n(27) Every problem the naysayers have with this bill was caused by people other than Trump. You elected them or allowed them to beat candidates you wanted (or you were too young to vote). The solutions to the problems are also now in your hands, not Trump\\'s. Midterms coming up.\\n(28) What America now needs is your work to return the largest possible majorities in Nov. \\n\\nTo those laying on the floor having a tantrum: Every hour you waste helps the Dems, NeverTrumps, Russia, &amp; all the other countries threatening us &amp; stealing from us, with/without RU help.\\n(29) So think about that. \\n\\nAnd if you try to waste my time complaining to me, don\\'t expect much of a response. I\\'ve heard it all before. \\n\\nMy attention is a privilege not a right and must be earned. \\n\\nEND',\n",

I was the Supervisor over putting Chuckie Taylor away for torture &amp; war crimes, Wesame Deleame for killing American soldiers, Robert Levinson who I believe remains in Iran\\n(3) I believe Bob should have been home at least a decade ago and will not rest until I expose the reason why he was not a priority to McCabe’s best friend, NSB Chief Carl Ghattas. I have worked on the Holyland Foundation aka Hamas case as a case agent over the NJ office head\\n(4) I have been the Supervisory Special Agent over a groundbreaking case that changed the way the Intelligence Community hunted down terrorists. That’s how I met @GenFlynn and other true patriots.  The FBI now has a section in their Counterterrorism Dept based on the work of my\\n(5) team. Funny though not really funny, the only people not to get the Director’s Award for spearheading this op are myself, my analyst and the FBI Attorney who kept us on the right path. We three took beatings for two years to get this going. There is a sinister side to this\\nYou see, when McCabe signed off on the bogus OPR against me, he already knew and admitted he knew I had already filed an EEO complaint or was going to file one against the two individuals who wrote up the referral to OPR, five days after I filed my EEO. Six days after my SES boss\\n(7) six days after my boss told me he’d pull my timecards “if I took that route.” So I was involuntarily removed from my position of Senior Detailee to the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center.  Unbeknownst to the FBI, my direct supervisor praised my performance in an unclassified email\\n(8) Meanwhile, the GS-15 salary that you tax payers were paying the salary of was idled and given nothing to do for months.If I got an assignment, it was usually clerical. I had supervised multi-national operations against terrorists all over the world @ Washington Field Office’s\\n(9) Extraterritorial Counterterrorism Squad. I beat out 26 people to get selected for this post. Later, the FBI selected me #1 to represent them at a four month advanced security session (4 months) in Garmisch, Germany. 141 participants from 43 countries.\\n(10) I was the only native English speaking female in that class.  I represented the FBI proudly and even taught a couple classes since they used cases I had worked on in their curriculum.

I watched the twin towers come down in front of me, I had crucial  relationships all over the world and now I wanted to work together with the CIA to fight terror.  I was selected for the position and specialized in Yemen and Somalia.  But for only 4-5 months\\n(13) it was during this time that two FBI male agents were harassing me and an African American agent. I stood up for both of us. The harassment and undermining of my critical terrorism work by these two got worse. I tried to tell my Assistant Director Andrew McCabe but was told\\n(14) contacting him was inappropriate.  Mind you, I had worked with McCabe since 2005 and he had been my boss at Washington Field.  So I contacted EEO, since working through the Ombudsman was useless. I had been working on a major disruption of a bombing plot and ten days later\\n(15) I was involuntarily removed from my position. My Deputy Assistant Director told me the AD, McCabe, made the decision. So that’s where I ended up, in that administrative unit doing GS-4 work as a GS-15 step 4.

The narrative contained MY accomplishments but put someone else’s name as the recipient.  They even left in personal commendations from Gen McChrystal and now Gen Flynn, both who didn’t know the buddy of\\n(17) of McCabe’s who actually got the award and $10k as part of it.  Yes, this other person, now head of an office on the West Coast and a part of McCabe’s regime got the Director’s Award using my accomplishments.  Meanwhile, I was actively pursuing my EEO, paying about $57k in\\n(18) attorney fees in one year.  I was notified more than a month after I filed the EEO, that I was under OPR for time and attendance, insubordination and disruptive behavior while on duty.  These charges are used by people when they have nothing but want you out.\\n(19) The two brain surgeons who filed the OPR left their emails in my folder which I got to review.

       " 'THREAD. I want to talk to you about what it was like to grow up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a Roman Catholic, and what\\'s helpful or not helpful to say to folks/communities in times like there where yet another hideous ring of abuse has been exposed.\\nI grew up in Scranton. It\\'s a heavily Catholic town -- with parishes &amp; parish schools in every neighborhood (at least when I was still growing up), and with most families taking church really seriously. I know my family did. I missed church &lt;10x in my ENTIRE LIFE before college.\\nI was, myself, a very visibly Catholic kid (I\\'m now athiest). I served the televised masses at St. Anne\\'s Basilica, \"starred\" in the weekly children\\'s mass on TV, attended Catholic school, sang in Catholic youth choirs, won the Bishop\\'s Lay Award for my service to the church.\\nAnd ya\\'ll, I was around these men. Several of the listed men. And I loved them, and I trusted them. And while I will never excuse what they did, I need to explain to you why saying \"Screw these pedo priests\" is not only unhelpful (even to me, who disdains the church) but cruel.\\nIn Scranton, there\\'s no small amount of \"ethnic segregation.\" No, not referring to racism -- referring to ethnic tribalism. Neighborhoods are steeped in ethnicity: Minooka/Irish, West/Italian, South/German, East/Slovac, Moosic/Polish. Churches supported specific communities.\\nMy 1st church, St. Mary Czestochowa, is 1 block from my parents\\' house. 1 block the other direction is my dad\\'s childhood home. He attended SMC all his life until we switched to a nearby Irish parish (then St. Joe\\'s, now Divine Mercy) because I started singing the masses there.\\nThese ethnic churches are bastions of ties to Old World communities that represent so much more than any God. They were places old languages were kept alive. Old lullabyes from old countries. Traditional foods. Traditional customs. Ways of life that were carried across oceans.\\nI remember growing up in SMC. The smell of Polish foods cooking in the church basement during my Sunday classes. Learning about Poland. The soft sound of elderly Polish women singing and talking in Polish, teaching us Christmas Carols and Polish swear words. Keeping Poland alive.\\nThe Church made my family\\'s history real. We are nearly completely Polish, and my engagement in SMC even as a child blurred together my ethnicity, my identity and sense of history, my understanding of god, my understanding of my family. It was never just about \"the church.\"\\nThe church was both a spiritual \"Jesus\" community and a spiritual \"Polish\" community. It was a family that sustained itself and its members through lore, love, shared memory, a sense of purpose and identity that seemed frozen so beautifully in time amidst a modernized world.\\nWhen I wasn\\'t at my home church, I attended Catholic School. St. Mary\\'s Assumption, then Marian Catholic. I loved those schools, where nuns taught some of the classes &amp; priests were teachers, coaches, chaperones, mentors, friends. Religious people were the fabric of my education.\\nI sang in a Catholic School youth choir, and we performed each year in Cathedral Capers -- a cabaret showcasing the musical talents of nuns, priests, and various Catholics of the diocese. It. Was. SO. Fun. I can still remember how hard Fr. Altavilla made me laugh. He was so kind.\\nBetween Capers, and Catholic School, and my involvement at St. Anne\\'s doing the televised masses, I. Met. A. Lot. Of. Priests. I worked closely with them. Traveled with them. Laughed with them. Looked up to them. Loved them. In the trusting way that young people do.\\nAnd I know multiple men who have now been accused. And my heart breaks. Not for me -- they didn\\'t touch me -- but for the communities they served, and the sense of \"living church\" they destroyed. They traumatized children. They LIED. They covered up lies. They kept lying.\\nI grieve the sacred, historical groups they shattered -- no, not the Roman/Vatican kind -- the Polish kind, the German kind, the Irish kind. I grieve the shattered communities of lost languages, special foods, memories of safety and belonging. I grieve the loss of identity.\\nI grieve the warm, safe feeling I had about St. Mary Czestochowa\\'s summer picnic, running through the dark alleyway to my house with my little cousin, bellies full of halupki, excited to announce we won a raffle. I grieve saying \"Zimno!\" when it\\'s cold. I grieve, and grieve.\\nThese priests shattered children. They shattered communities, families, connections to worlds we rapidly lose each day we become a little more \"just American,\" &amp; a little less Polish, or Slovac, or German, etc -- those aspects of ethnicity that create identity, value, a home.\\nI lost some part of my stake in this when I saw Fr. Homer named. Fr. Homer was the last pastor I knew at St. Mary Czestochowa. I shook his hand every Sunday for years. I can\\'t look at those years the same. I wept when I saw Fr. Altavilla, Fr. Paulish. Men I knew and loved.\\nTo be clear: I don\\'t think my losses rival that of their victims. I don\\'t think explaining the Catholic Church\\'s cultural significance in a Blue Collar town will convince most of you that the Church matters. It\\'s OK if you don\\'t think that. But here\\'s what I do need you to know.\\nWhen you say \"The Church is disgusting,\" you are maligning more than pedophiles, more than corrupt Bishops like James Timlin. When you call all priests rapists, you malign more than those men who are. When you roll your eyes about another Catholic Church scandal, you hurt me.\\nWhen you roll your eyes at yet more hurt, you hurt me/others like me whose childhoods, adulthoods, souls, memories are wrapped up in the difficult/painful legacies these men left behind. You hurt my connection to Poland. You hurt my memories of Baptisms, Confirmations, funerals.\\nIt is too easy and too simple to think that the Catholic Church only keeps the god-souls of its flock alive. No. The Catholic Church I knew was a living god, a human collection of souls, a place of connection to one another and to a cultural identity we were losing in America.\\nThe Catholic Church I grew up in was representative of a human soul. Not just one that loved Jesus, but one that loved Polish carols and homemade pierogi and pascha bread and family crests and cursing in Yiddish and babcis and families and a home that was both here AND there.\\nI DO NOT EXCUSE THESE HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY MEN I LOVED. I don\\'t ask you to. But when you insult the church writ large in response to these crimes, know that the emotional EXPERIENCE of church is distinct from the ORGANIZATION of church, for many.\\nKnow that my sweet grandmothers knitting quilts in church basements and straightening their grandson\\'s ties are not the acts of Bishop Timlin nor his priests. Know that the church-as-community is where Catholicism lives, for Catholics, not the church-as-Vatican or church-as-law.\\nAnd know that no matter HOW many times another sexual violence ring is exposed, it is not \"old news\" to the children-now-grownups who have awoken to see their heroes dethroned and destroyed and unrecognizable. It\\'s not old news. It hurts fresh, it hurts raw, it hurts real.\\nSo in the rush to glibly deride Catholics, Catholicism, the Church, etc. in the wake of scandal, I just ask that you limit your vitriol to the criminals themselves and I ask that you consider how they\\'ve shattered children, yes, but communities too. And that there\\'s such grief.\\nIt isn\\'t old news to anyone who grew up in a Catholic town. Our very childhoods are pulverized, even if no priest laid his hands on us. Our hearts are broken. Spare us your glib vitriol long enough to let us grieve the loss of men we thought we knew, men we thought we loved.\\nThese priests and their enablers deserve the worst of what comes to them. I do not condone them. I do not forgive them. I am enraged by all they have broken. I am enraged by what we lose every time we drift further from communities where we should have felt safe.\\nI hope in your calls for justice, you can remember that their wreckage extends beyond known victims. Please. I hope you can know that when you malign Catholicism writ large, you\\'re maligning so much more than you intend.\\n\\nThe Church is bleeding out its poison. Allow us our grief.',\n",
       " '1. Clinton Dossier - \"Signals\".  Stuff no-one seems to ask themselves.... https://t.co/IYzUKkekKo\\n2. There\\'s a myriad of seemingly disconnected dots amid the story of the DOJ and FBI spying on candidate Trump.  But oddly no-one asks raw questions...\\n3. For instance.  Why did ODNI Dan Coats decide to declassify a FISA Court opinion in April and May 2017 ?..  What was Coats motivation for a historic shift in transparency of FISA court material ?... https://t.co/MdJqgpl6wh\\n4.  Why put this into the sunlight if there was not a bigger reason to do so? https://t.co/SvQRK9hzjv  Seriously.  Simple question.  Why declassify it? https://t.co/rFhbArP7CT\\n5.  Additionally...  How/Why do we discover Peter Strzok?  Why was there a media release about this FBI agent in December?   What\\'s the purpose?\\n\\nhttps://t.co/wvYGSZtDNj https://t.co/fsYytLCcky\\n6.  Where did this story originate, and why did the entity who released the story wish the public to know about it?  https://t.co/QhPmC8yHFh\\n7.  Why did an anonymous somebody tell the media Peter Strzok was the FBI agent who interviewed General Michael Flynn,  three days before Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators?  https://t.co/SV7E0sThml\\n8.  Why was it important to anonymous *somebodies* that we know about Peter Strzok and DOJ/FBI lawyer Lisa Page.  https://t.co/DQkjwAPrLN\\n9.  Why was it important for people inside the intelligence community to tell the public, anonymously, that Lisa Page and Peter Strzok were conspiring to assist Hillary Clinton and eliminate candidate Donald Trump?\\n10.  Why was it important for the public to know that Agent Peter Strzok and Attorney Lisa Page changed the wording on the FBI talking points that James Comey used to exonerate candidate Hillary Clinton?  https://t.co/2LaTSr8kaa\\n11.  Who, inside the intelligence community, was pushing out that information?  What was the intention of pushing out that information?  Why did they think the public needed to know about it? https://t.co/aja5618tFl\\n12. Why did they need to tell the American public that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were no longer in a position to influence current investigative events?   Why was that important to the intelligence community?\\n13. All reporting on Strzok and Page pushes the media to inquire back to the DOJ Public Information Officer for comment on the media reporting.  https://t.co/QhPmC8yHFh\\n14.  The DOJ responds to the questions from the media by referring all inquiry to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Michael Horowitz.  Who tells media: https://t.co/QhPmC8yHFh https://t.co/8npzFLRxh6\\n15. The response from the OIG, to the December 2017 media inquiry, forces THIS to the sunlight: https://t.co/YvZzIyDMfA https://t.co/wvuQH7vjFh\\n16.  Immediately following the news of a Michael Flynn indictment release, a blitzkrieg of parallel randomly stories surfaces.  Including https://t.co/8d3qHNaL6g\\n17.  Litterally at the same time an indictment against Flynn is announced.  Someone within the intelligence community hits back with information about more DOJ corruption; this time DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr:  https://t.co/8d3qHNaL6g https://t.co/vtDniv5nQg\\n18.  Why?  What\\'s going on?  Why is the IC hitting back hard against Robert Mueller\\'s team outcome, by releasing damaging information about those who have participated inside the Mueller investigation?   Who is punching back?  It\\'s not the media. This is insider justice stuff. https://t.co/j8ptMa3El3\\n19.  This part of the intelligence community is transparently pissed off.  They keep striking out pummeling the Mueller team.   Why?  Who are they?  And they don\\'t let up... https://t.co/7yCmAumkg1\\n20.  Whoever *they* are, inside this IC writ large, is not just hitting out - they are naming names. They\\'ve named: Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Andrew \"Andy\" McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, Glenn Simpson, and they don\\'t let up.  https://t.co/7yCmAumkg1\\n21. Not only do they name names, but they actually provide physical evidence that goes along with those names.  Text messages between the participants: https://t.co/ZXRGO3ngXH\\n22.  It just seems odd that no-one ever asked WHY?  Why is it important to these people to put this information out.  Up until December 2017 almost all leaks were against the office of the presidency.  These are against IC Officials.\\n23.  This series of coordinated stories distributed to the media are not random occurrences.  The frequency and timing is too well coordinated. The MSM are forced to cover them - even though they don\\'t want to.  But no-one in MSM asks WHY? Why are these IC reports coming out?\\n24.  And the deluge of IC push-back doesn\\'t let up.  Two days after James Baker accompanies Andrew McCabe to a House hearing BOOM he\\'s nailed too. https://t.co/ykkh7yZxz2\\n25.  Less than a day after Intel Chairman Nunes tells the media of his intention to question FBI lead counsel James Baker https://t.co/EWOWTFAMEp WHAMMO !!  Baker is defrocked, put in charge of counting staplers, and exposed as a leaker.  https://t.co/eWct9CxdM8 https://t.co/e0GqkqZ1Lj\\n26. All of this happens in a matter of a stunning two weeks +/- a few days.  Yet, no-one seems to ask why?  Why then?  Why was it important to *someone* to get this information out, get these people exposed, and get this into the media bloodstream.\\n27. Not a single one of the stories around Strzok, Page, Comey, B Ohr, or N Ohr, Simpson, McCabe, or Baker was real-time information attached to their current activity. All of the information was as they are quarantined. Yet it all came out in a two week period.  Why?\\n28.  I just find it interesting that no-one in MSM is looking at the reason we are able to put all of this together.  The story, and scale, of corruption inside the FBI and DOJ is obviously important to someone inside the FBI and DOJ. https://t.co/glBz1DOGCL\\n29.  And whoever it is, for whatever motive they have, they have presented a ton of evidence preparing us for something rather significant.  It\\'s remarkable how much the MSM is ignoring it. https://t.co/dhUVlXZxK1\\n30.  Goodnight. https://t.co/003xdG6lpP',\n",
       " 'I had a police officer stationed in my high school. At one point he got a warrant to investigate me for a stolen calculator, that I didn’t steal. He kicked down my door after school one day with 8 other cops in riot gear with guns drawn on my Grandma.\\nI ran upstairs and hid under the bed because I thought he was there to kill me. He took my computer, phone, and trashed my entire room as an officer held me and my grandmother in my kitchen at gun point.\\nI was expected to go to school the next day with him there. I had to hold it all in. I had nightmares about it for years. I couldn’t focus in class, I was always terrified. The white kids were getting stickers from him as I feared for my life.\\nI couldn’t get school work done the same as the other kids because I had no computer so I fell behind. This impacted which colleges I could go to.\\nAt one point he finally returned my items. I was obviously not charged. But he would constantly pull me out of class in a public manner and question me about the calculator. He would do so with my vice principle in the room.\\nEventually everyone knew I was always being talked to by the officer so it impacted my reputation and only enforced the stereotypes my white peers already held.\\nThen, as I was in contention to become the captain of the track team, despite his efforts, he showed up at practice and handcuffed me in front of my coaches and teammates.\\nHe took me to jail where I sat for hours. My parents were on vacation, there was no one I could call. He then told me I was not under arrest but that he was trying to teach me a lesson.\\nAfter that the coaches would not let me become captain, again impacting my college options. It also impacted which kids would risk associating with me. For some kids this means hanging out with kids who are actually committing crimes and falling into that life.\\nI cannot state enough how terrified I was in school at all times. Every morning I wondered if he would arrest me at school. I saw him everyday. Every night when I was supposed to do homework, I was worried he would kick my door in again.\\nEvery knock on the door terrified me my entire life, up until this day. The funny thing is, I was not political at all before this. But this and other experiences I had with police throughout my life pushed me into fighting for justice.\\nThe police didn’t just harass me and my high school friends at school. It was just part of life being black in a white neighborhood. Being stopped at the age of 14 and asked why I’m in my own neighborhood...\\nOr walking my dog and police pulling up and saying I was reported as a potential drug dealer by my own neighbors.\\nBeing thrown to the ground at 13 because I matched the description of someone who got in a fist fight.\\nBeing with my friend who was a recent rape victim when she saw her abuser and called the cops because she had a restraining order and police showing up and handcuffing me for their protection even though I wasn’t involved. I was 14. He Didn’t cuff the white kids around.\\nBeing stopped at 15 while walking down the street and drinking a water bottle because police said it looked like vodka. At 15...\\nBeing stopped at 16 while crossing the street because my pants were sagged and my backpack looked heavy so they thought I had a gun.\\nThis is just the life of a black kid. It’s just expected to be normal. It was the life of all my friends. We thought that was just life. We knew it didn’t happen to our white peers but we just thought it’s how it was. We thought we were flawed.\\nSo I say all this because these white school board members voting for more cops just don’t know what this all feels like. I will have this trauma for the rest of my life. It permanently messed me up. It ruined high school and narrowed my opportunities.\\nI was just a kid. People of color already have the entire deck stacked against us but to then throw salt in the wound and have those officers sit in the room next to us and expect us to learn? The same ones who harass us all day in and out of school?\\nAnd I didn’t even steal the damn calculator. I wasn’t the best kid. I smoked pot and cussed with my friends. But I knew white kids doing cocaine at 16. They had never had an interaction with police except when they got their damn stickers.\\nOur white students feared detention, I feared arrest. To hear white people tell me that Officer was there for my protection is laughable. He was there to oppress people of color.\\nAnd before you say I just had a bad cop, he quit being a police officer. He told me through a mutual friend that he quit because of me. He was horrified looking back at what he was forced to do to me. Idk what forced means in this context. Just what he said.\\nAnyways, just writing this thread really fucking hurts. I am one of the lucky ones. This isn’t about safety this is about trauma that you are giving little kids. Just please don’t.\\n@AmandaFritzRN @ChloeEudalyPDX @joannhardesty @tedwheeler please read this before you vote for more cops.\\nI only added commissioner elect Hardesty and Commissioner Eudaly because they can use these stories as more fuel to convince their colleagues, I trust them. I didn’t add Nick Fish cuz I couldn’t find his twitter handle lol. Someone tag him.\\nFuck I’m literally still crying I can’t believe writing that shit was so hard for me. I’m so used to talking about whatever even personal stuff and never being nervous but this really cuts deep. I was so damn young. I was good. They really fucked me up y’all. I don’t even cry lol\\nI didn’t expect this to blow up but since it did, there are things you can do.\\n- pressure your local officials to remove officers from schools\\n- uplift stories like these\\n- support PoC activists and businesses we need y’all to use your privilege to help offset these stories.\\nAnd when I say support I don’t just mean tweets. Buy from black owned businesses, donate to black and PoC orgs, compensate people for the work they are doing to change the world. My cash is $gregorymckelvey but there are people in your town too. Support them.\\nWe have to jump ten times higher to get to the same place. Help us with a boost.',\n",

Shout out to @Americanlll for his help. If you\\'re not following him you should be! #MemeWar and research master!\\n\\nSo, yesterday\\'s 911 system outage. Downplayed all over the place. Fact is folks, even those that are saying how \"significant\" of an attack it was, are not...\\n4. ...telling you the whole story! I just posted that this attack hit TONS of services throughout the ENTIRE United States. Emergency dispatch services, hospitals, prisons, schools, etc. Multiple \"victims\" in what CenturyLink called a \"network element\".\\n\\nhttps://t.co/dbNfWuoHQZ\\n5. But, realize just how CONTROLLED this hit was! It caused disruption to emergency services, but the emergency broadcast systems setup by POTUS early in his presidency worked just fine, notifying the majority of citizens of alternate numbers to 911 in case of emergency.\\n6. Hospitals weren\\'t shut down, they just had to use pen and paper for a little while. Prisons weren\\'t unlocked and gates opened, they just had to use radios instead of the phones. Schools had to have runners go to classrooms instead of using designated call systems. It was safe.\\n7. That\\'s a MAJOR tell folks. Do you imagine Russia, China, North Korea, or any of the rest of the \"enemies\" of America the fake news media tries to scare us about would\\'ve been that \\'reserved\\' in a hit on the US system? But, it won\\'t retract from eventually blaming them I bet!\\n8. I posted this thread on ties between HRC, BC, the CFoundation and the Chinese. The DJT wars against Huawei and ZTE spell out MAJOR EXPOSURE of #DeepState money, illegal campaign financing and a Chinese billionaire, James Riady and his LIPPO group.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/7yQatgtxvR\\n9. But man this is HUGE! CenturyLink, the group that got hit yesterday causing all of these outages, ARE MAJOR DEEP STATE! Folks, they have contracts for 911 services, hospital communications, prison systems and Dept of Defense (DOD) contracts for dark fiber communications.\\n10. They\\'re also tied into lottery systems, schools, banking communications and more. Do any of you think that one company, having all that oversight and control is a responsible thing to do? They have a monopoly on the biggest communications systems in this country!\\n11. But, how exactly did they get all that control? Well, hold onto your sneakers. They have been steadily increasing their footprint and their control over nearly every single internet, phone, and communications provider in the US! They\\'re massive! https://t.co/iKTqsd2F9A\\n12. But, who really controls them? Everybody knows, all decisions come from the top, right? Well...let\\'s look at who OWNS CenturyLink. You\\'re not going to believe this. Number one shareholder with 123+ million shares, worth $2.61 BILLION, is, Temasek holdings. Sound familiar?\\n13. It didn\\'t strike me right away either until I realized Temasek is basically a shell corporation. It has OWNERSHIP investments in...Alibaba Group Holdings! Any idea who that is? You should! Alibaba Group Holdings was started with money from LIPPO\\'s Riady family and friends.\\n14. Temasek also has ownership holdings in: CTL = CenturyLink. GILD = Gilead Sciences - a huge pharmaceutical corporation which is rumored to be tied to the tainted HIV medication the CFoundation and BC purchased with the help of Riady. It was sold to Africa and it killed people!\\n15. CenturyLink is co-controlled by Vanguard who have significant, if not controlling shares, of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Johnson and Johnson, and JP Morgan Chase bank! Are you getting the picture here folks? ALL DEEP STATE COMPANIES! CenturyLink is owned by our enemies!\\n16. Do you grasp what this means? The major and most vital communications systems in America. THE KESYTONE, is controlled by Deep State corporations!\\n\\nIf you care to look at the stocks, holdings, values, and what not of these companies, check it out here. https://t.co/vtCi4qB0Ck\\n17. How big is CenturyLink? For 50 years they\\'ve bought into and taken over parts of or, all of, tons of communications suppliers in America. A monopoly! Started 50 years ago? That\\'s when GHWB was liaison to China,  then became CIA director! Humm...\\nhttps://t.co/iKTqsd2F9A\\n18. Where did CenturyLink get all its government contracts and just how much do they control? This is where the monopolization gets scary. They\\'re not just controlling American communications anymore. It\\'s going worldwide! Look at this! They\\'re everywhere! https://t.co/Ob8ajGJ3u8\\n19. Truth be told, even with all of their control, all their contracts, and all of their assets, are they really performing well enough to continue this monopolization? Some experts say they\\'re not doing as well as regular investors like us would hope. https://t.co/W0R0nxGsKu\\n20. So, why in the world would they continue to be awarded contracts, move into bigger markets, and overtake more \"successful\" corporations like Verizon? Well, that\\'s where this \"alternative agenda\" comes in and suggests the Deep State is doing this for a reason. Look at this!\\n21. \"Alibaba is kicking off its annual Alifest conference in Hangzhou, China next week with a star-studded lineup of speakers to help celebrate its 10th anniversary....Keynote presenters at the SME Summit include President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J. CFoundation...\"\\n22. WHAT THE HELL? Did you get that? I could leave it all right here and you would know I\\'m telling you the truth! The big dog himself, old slick willy, is partnered with the group that controls the major and critical communication systems of the US! https://t.co/nfXvSjf5Nj\\n23. @Americanlll found that essential and critical link. I told you, if you\\'re not following him, you should be!\\n\\nThere\\'s a LOT of other big names in that line up including the CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz. I encourage more research into that if anyone has the time.\\n24. These massive corporations have fingers in nearly every country, working behind the scenes to control, to manipulate, and to MONITOR communications. What has POTUS and Q done? They\\'ve taken us to the back channels, they\\'re rescuing the keystone.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/7T9CcRYq7Y\\n25. There\\'s been a relentless effort to extend this monitoring and control by CenturyLink, aka, the Deep State, by our own government officials! CONGRESS issued the contracts to these players. EVERYTHING is monitored, recorded, controlled. Purposefully!\\n\\nhttps://t.co/T8BIa7PiMk\\n26. So what IS the keystone folks? It is our central ability to communicate, unrestricted. What does that sound like? Folks, the Keystone is...the 1st amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is the KEY that all other rights hinge on. It is our most precious right.\\n27. Those sons of bitches who control, manipulate, silence and otherwise prohibit our speech literally overtook our ability to communicate. The deep state infected the media which is no longer free speech, it is directed, controlled, and targeted to misinform and disrupt.\\n28. The #QAnon movement solidifies the backdoor channels to free speech lke what I\\'m doing right now. I\\'m doing my damnedest to research, learn, compile, and inform the rest of you. I will be shadow banned again, I will get hundreds of spam emails again. It shouldn\\'t be that way.\\n29. Our 1st amendment right is the Keystone. The Founders knew it must be protected. Let your voice be known! Stand for what\\'s free and what\\'s right!\\n\\nGod Bless!\\n\\n#WWG1WGA, #WAWY, #1stAmendment, #Keystone, #LibertyAtAllCosts\\n\\n- The End\\nOne of the greatest speeches ever made. I\\'m including the entire video, not just the usual shortened version. At about the 5:18 mark, close your eyes. Listen to the man.

       " '1/ Thread analyzing Judge O\\'Connor\\'s ACA decision https://t.co/hOWHPMhaSj\\n2/ The court found that the individual parties have standing, even though there is no penalty for going uninsured: there is no requirement to show economic injury to establish standing. The mandate, by itself, suffices. https://t.co/QGlVx6QQ6I\\n3/ Moreover, a decision for the Plaintiffs would \"free\" them from mandate, so causation and redressability are satisfied. https://t.co/KvBhWwqII1\\n4/ Next, the Court followed the reasoning of NFIB to conclude that the individual mandate, without the penalty, is unconstitutional. https://t.co/ZtcHFy0GVf\\n5/ The Court draws the important distinction: the mandate and the penalty are different statutory provisions. Cong exempted some ppl from penalty, but not mandate. This fact shows that the unpenalized mandate has force. Many critics of this decision do not recognize this fact https://t.co/QswIlmKpUZ\\n6/ Congress in 2010 (ACA) and 2017 (TCJA) treated mandate and penalty as separate provisions. https://t.co/PcV2Q8RoRr\\n7/ The Court also rejects the intervenor\\'s argument that the penalty from 2018 will continue to generate revenue for years to come, because people may delay paying that exaction. https://t.co/p4WtcFYxou\\n8/ Because the mandate no longer triggers a tax, it cannot be saved under the Taxing Power. https://t.co/tmzFquyniP\\n9/ Judge O\\'Connor also reaches an important point that many critics reject: a mandate, without a penalty, still \"has an enormous influence on social norms and individual conduct in society.\" https://t.co/bLO0HASZtx\\n10/ In conclusion, the Court found that \"the Individual Mandate, unmoored from a tax, is unconstitutional\" https://t.co/4plju6KVTz\\n11/ Next, the Court turns to severability--the most difficult aspect of the case. The parties disagree on which intent controls \"the 2010 Congress that passed the ACA or the 2017 Congress that passed the TCJA.\" I address this question in my new article: https://t.co/OZsgtyYHUS https://t.co/1XjVJnuer9\\n12/ The Court concludes that it doesn\\'t matter which Congress\\'s intent controls. \"the Court finds both Congresses manifested the same intent: The Individual Mandate is inseverable from the entire ACA\" https://t.co/VeeBouZ9LI\\n13/ The strongest indication of Congress\\'s 2010 intent was in the findings (part of the statute) which were not repealed. https://t.co/MtLfc9W7Dv\\n14/ J. O\\'Connor notes DOJ took same position here, as it did in NFIB: GI and CR are not severable from mandate. However, he notes that many NFIB amici now take a different position. \"But that was then, and this is now.\" https://t.co/cVzCECK5dP\\n15/ J. O\\'Connor cites NFIB and King v. Burwell to show that \"Individual Mandate is inseverable from the entirety of the ACA\" (with a citation to @RandyEBarnett) https://t.co/5EmePfTqAe\\n16/ The Court concludes that \"That requirement—the Individual Mandate— was essential to the ACA’s architecture.\" Therefore, it is inseverable from rest of law. Here, Judge O\\'Connor quotes from #Unprecedented about the death spiral that will result in a mandate-less ACA https://t.co/drb7ukKORZ\\n17/ The Court also notes that a mandate-less ACA is an entirely new law, which would shift costs for uncompensated care. (Here, he cites #Unprecedented again) https://t.co/RByrWi6dZP\\n18/ In sum, the Court finds that the 2010 Congress would not have enacted the ACA but for the ACAs. This conclusion is consistent with the NFIB joint dissent, and implied by the RBG opinion. https://t.co/vfGTVIxbiV\\n19/ The far more important aspect of the opinion focuses on the intent of Congress in 2017. J. O\\'Connor explains that due to the reconciliation process, Congress could not have had an intent about the mandate. https://t.co/V90oKd5Mvs\\n20/ In 2017, Congress did not repeal the individual mandate. Therefore, 2017 Congress \"intended to preserve the Individual Mandate because the 2017 Congress, like the 2010 Congress, knew that provision is essential to the ACA\" https://t.co/IdROACxLrA\\n21/ Second, 2017 Congress did not (and could not) repeal statutory findings that mandate was \"essential\" to ACA https://t.co/4leG8dXsbx\\n22/ Third, the Court recognizes the key limitation on the 2017-intent argument: because of the reconcliation rules, Congress could not--and did not--modify the intent of the 2010 Congress. https://t.co/47gPdkaFbV\\n23/ Finally, the Court rejects the intervenor\\'s alternative argument: if 2017 Tax Cut law rendered the mandate is unconstitutional, then the correct remedy is to declare the Tax Cut unconstitutional. Here, the court adopts my argument in #Undone https://t.co/OZsgtyYHUS https://t.co/uGNyfbcF7P\\n24/ Five points to respond to common criticisms. First, the text of the ACA distinguishes between the mandate and the shared responsibility payment. The law describes only the former as \"essential\" to the ACA. The mandate survives TCJA\\n25/ Second, Congress in 2017 could not, and did not repeal the individual mandate. If the Republicans had 60 votes, they would have taken that step, but couldn\\'t. This reality demonstrates that the intent was to leave the individual mandate in place.\\n26/ Third, the most intuitive answer is that the intent of Congress in 2017 matters, not the intent of Congress in 2010. Severability doctrine must consider whether, and how Congress in 2017 modified the law. See point #2 above.\\n27/ Fourth, the joint opinion in NFIB expressly found the mandate could not be severed from the rest of the ACA. The other opinions suggested as much. And King v. Burwell reaffirmed that linkage.\\n28/ Fifth, J. O\\'Connor stopped short of entering a nationwide injunction (a refreshing change of pace). We only have a grant of summary judgment. Now, this issue can percolate up to #SCOTUS in the usual course.\\n29/ One final point. President Trump quickly opined on the matter in two tweets: https://t.co/wfCDgOxFR2\\n30/ Here, we do not have an Obama Judge or a Trump judge, but a highly respected judge https://t.co/VqujmlynJv\\n31/ The third book in the Obamacare trilogy continues to write itself.

       " 'Trump Scores, Breaks Generals’ 50-Year War Record \\n\\nHis national security team had been trying to box him in like every other president. But he called their bluff.\\n https://t.co/3QaDZfv9be\\nThe mainstream media has attacked President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as impulsive, blindsiding his own national security team.\\nBut detailed, published accounts of the policy process over the course of the year tell a very different story.\\nThey show that senior national security officials and self-interested institutions have been playing a complicated political game for months aimed at keeping Trump from wavering on our indefinite presence on the ground in Syria.\\nThe entire episode thus represents a new variant of a familiar pattern dating back to Vietnam in which national security advisors put pressure on reluctant presidents to go along with existing or proposed military deployments in a war zone.\\nThe difference here is that Trump, by publicly choosing a different policy, has blown up their transparent schemes and offered the country a new course, one that does not involve a permanent war state.\\nThe relationship between Trump and his national security team has been tense since the beginning of his administration.\\nBy mid-summer 2017, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joseph Dunford had become so alarmed at Trump’s negative responses to their briefings justifying global U.S. military deployments that they decided to do a formal briefing at the Pentagon.\\nBut when Mattis and Dunford sang the praises of the “rules-based, international democratic order” that has “kept the peace for 70 years,” Trump simply shook his head in disbelief.\\nBy the end of that year, however, Mattis, Dunford, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed they’d succeeded in getting Trump to use U.S. troops not only to defeat ISIS but to “stabilize” the entire northeast sector of Syria and balance Russian and Iranian-sponsored forces.\\nYet they ignored warning signs of Trump’s continuing displeasure with their vision of a more or less permanent American military presence in Syria.\\nIn a March rally in Ohio ostensibly about health care reform, Trump suddenly blurted out, “We’re coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon—very soon we’re coming out.”\\nThen in early April 2018, Trump’s impatience with his advisors on Syria boiled over into a major confrontation at a National Security Council meeting, where he ordered them unequivocally to accept a fundamentally different Syria deployment policy.\\nTrump opened the meeting with his public stance that the United States must end its intervention in Syria and the Middle East more broadly. He argued repeatedly that the U.S. had gotten “nothing” for its efforts, according to an account published by the AP.\\nWhen Dunford asked him to state exactly what he wanted, Trump answered that he favored an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces and an end to the “stabilization” program in Syria.\\nMattis responded that an immediate withdrawal from Syria was impossible to carry out responsibly, would risk the return of Islamic State, and would play into the hands of Russia, Iran, and Turkey, whose interests ran counter to those of the United States.\\nTrump reportedly then relented and said they have could five or six months to destroy the Islamic State. But he also made it clear that he did not want them to come back to him in October and say that they had been unable to defeat ISIS and had to remain in Syria.\\nWhen his advisors reiterated that they didn’t think America could withdraw responsibly, Trump told them to “just get it done.” \\n\\nTrump’s national security team had prepared carefully for the meeting in order to steer him away from an explicit timetable for withdrawal.\\nThey brought papers that omitted any specific options for withdrawal timetables. Instead, as the detailed AP account shows, they framed the options as a binary choice—either an immediate pullout or an indefinite presence in order to ensure complete and permanent defeat of ISIS\\nThe leave option was described as risking a return of ISIS and leaving a power vacuum for Russia and Iran to fill.\\nSuch a binary strategy had worked in the past, according to admin sources. That would account for Trump’s long public silence on Syria during the early months of 2018 while then-SOS Tillerson and Mattis were articulating detailed arguments for a long-term military commitment.\\nAnother reason the approach had been so successful, however, was that Trump had made such a big issue out of Barack Obama giving the Pentagon a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan. As a result, he was hesitant to go public with a similar request for a Syria timetable.\\nA DoD official who had been briefed on the meeting “rejected that any sort of timeline was discussed.” Furthermore the official asserted that Mattis “was not asked to draw up withdrawal options….”\\nLieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Chiefs, also told reporters, “the president has actually been very good in not giving us a specific timeline.”\\nNevertheless, without referring to a timeline, the White House issued a short statement saying that the U.S. role in Syria was coming to a “rapid end.”\\nMattis and Dunford were consciously exploiting Trump’s defensiveness about a timeline to press ahead with their own strategy unless and until Trump publicly called them on it. That is what finally happened some weeks after Trump’s six month deadline had passed.\\nThe claim by Trump advisors that they were taken by surprise was indeed disingenuous. What happened last week was that Trump followed up on the clear policy he had laid down in April.\\nThe Syria withdrawal affair is a dramatic illustration of the fundamental quandary of the Trump presidency in regard to ending the state of permanent war that previous administrations created.\\nAlthough a solid majority of Americans want to rein in U.S. military deployments in the Middle East and Africa, Trump’s national security team is committed to doing the opposite.\\nTrump is now well aware that it is virtually impossible to carry out the foreign policy that he wants without advisors who are committed to the same objective.\\nThat means that he must find people who have remained outside the system during the permanent war years while being highly critical of its whole ideology and culture.\\nIf he can fill key positions with truly dissident figures, the last two years of this term in office could decisively clip the wings of the bureaucrats and generals who have created the permanent war state we find ourselves in today.',\n",

Instead, use de novo clustering algorithms to form OTUs 1/\\nOpen/closed reference methods were developed because people have the type of crappy data that you get when reads don\\'t fully overlap. High error rates increase the number of uniques making downstream processing more difficult 2/ https://t.co/TwQmAnJ4M8\\nSo why are open (and closed) reference clustering bad? Let\\'s look at closed reference first. I may self-plagiarize in some of the following tweets 3/ https://t.co/SV7G8C5M7v\\nObviously, you\\'re limited to seeing what is in the database. Considering we\\'re sequencing deeper than any of the studies that generated the reference sequences, we\\'re going to fail to classify many sequences 4/\\nUsing a mouse dataset we found 32,106 unique sequences. Using a 3% threshold we were able to map 27,876 w/ VSEARCH and 27,737 w/ USEARCH - both methods are heuristics, which help to speed things up, but cut corners 5/\\nWhen we calculated the actual distances between the mouse sequences and the database sequences, we were able to map 28,238 sequences to a reference 6/\\nWe then randomized the order of the database. We got different numbers of sequences to map to a reference with different randomizations. The default order is probably about as bad as you could do 7/ https://t.co/v5Txhea2US\\nThe XSEARCH heuristics cut corners and don\\'t have perfect sensitivity. But they also result in a loss of specificity - USEARCH was 0.73 and VSEARCH was 0.60 8/\\nBut that\\'s just the start. The reference that many use is based on the greengenes database (fwiw - greengenes is defunct and the database has not been updated) 9/\\nThe reference represents sequences that are not more than 97% similar to each other...  over the full length of the gene. We popped out the V4 region of those sequences 10/\\nAmong these V4 fragments, we found that 3,132 ref sequences had one duplicate, of those, 443 had discordant taxonomies. Among the 1,699 V4 reference sequences with two or more duplicates, 698 had discordant taxonomies 11/\\nWe found reference sequences that had 10, 30 and even 131 reference sequences that contained 7, 7, and 5 different taxonomies 12/\\nWe calculated the true distance between the mice &amp; ref seqs: 47% of the mouse seqs mapped to refs that were identical over the V4 region, 17% mapped equally well to 2+ refs that were not identical over the V4 region 13/\\n13% had a conflicted taxonomy *gulp* 14/\\nYes closed-reference OTUs are \"stable\", but only if you look at it from the samples\\' perspective. They aren\\'t from the references\\' perspective. This has consequences for people using Fast UniFrac, PICRUSt, etc 15/\\nSome of these problems could be solved w/ a ref where the V4 (or whatever region) sequences are not more than 97% similar to each other, but you\\'d also have to deal with conflicting taxonomies and the poor specificity of XSEARCH 16/\\nLet\\'s discuss one more thing before moving on to open reference clustering. With closed reference, if a seq is more than 97% similar (or whatever level) to a reference, the seq is assigned to that ref OTU 17/\\nWe\\'ve already discussed several problems with this. Another, is that two seqs might only be 94% similar to each other, but be in the same OTU - this isn\\'t what we typically think is going on when we talk about 97% OTUs. Right? 18/\\nNow open reference clustering... In this approach, sequences are first subjected to closed ref clustering and those that don\\'t map to a reference are run through a de novo clustering approach 19/\\nIn de novo clustering sequences that are more than 97% similar to each other are clustered. There are many ways to do this and I certainly have data/papers to support one over the field of methods 20/\\nWhen one uses open ref clustering, you get all the problems of closed reference clustering, but you are also mixing and matching OTU definitions 21/\\nYou get the possibility of sequences that are only 94% similar to each other in the same OTU (closed ref) and those that are at least 97% similar to each other (de novo) 22/\\nDepending on what type of samples you\\'re sequencing you\\'ll get different ratios of OTUs generated by closed ref and de novo clustering. Human/mouse are mostly closed, soil probably has more de novo 23/\\nWe developed using an objective, distance-based metric for assessing OTU clustering quality. It asks are the correct sequences included in the OTU and are there any sequences that should have been included in the OTU? It\\'s called MCC 24/\\nHere\\'s what we saw for a few datasets. This shows that the closed/open reference algorithms don\\'t measure up to de novo https://t.co/Gsg6C9hCfV 25/ https://t.co/1eyyurrXlg\\nLater we developed our own de novo heuristic that optimizes MCC as it forms the OTUs - OptiClust. This forms the best OTUs of any clustering method we\\'ve found https://t.co/1fEDtlt3x2 26/ https://t.co/ZQb9fZvSKi\\nOne nock against de novo methods is that you get different results for each iteration of the method. Yup. What we\\'ve found is that you get equally good clusterings - there is no one optimal method 27/\\nThere\\'s also the nock that we shouldn\\'t be using OTUs, but that\\'s a topic for another tweet storm 28/\\nAppendix: Here\\'s actual data showing what happens when reads don\\'t overlap.

Examples include EMP and AGP data where single reads or 2x150 nt reads were used to sequence the 250 nt V4 region 30/\\nAppendix: Other examples include people getting greedy and sequencing V3-V4 with 2x250 nt reads or 2x300 nt reads 31/\\nFootnote: I\\'ve been saying the same thing for years now.

       " '1. Remember that WH memo written by McGahn, confidential, that we discussed a while ago? The one detailing a timeline of events leading up to Flynn\\'s resignation? It\\'s in Mueller\\'s hands.Bloop! https://t.co/44TTOLhBoV\\n2.  The reporter for this story has been allowed to READ the memo in its entirety as well as other underlying WH records quoted in the memo, such as other notes and memos written by McGahn and other senior administration officials.\\n3. The reporter also interviewed a dozen former and current WH officials, attorneys who have interacted with Mueller\\'s team and witnesses questioned by Mueller.\\n4. Doowd and SEkulow quoted selectively from this memo to argue that Trump did not obstruct justice. THey also said (LOL) that even if Trump knew there had been FBI probe of Flynn, he believed Flynn had been cleared. Double LOL. Sure, that\\'s why he asked Comey to let it go.\\n5. Full review of the memo on part of the reporter \"flatly contradicts\" Dowd and Sekulow\\'s story. Memo states Trump WAS told Flynn was under FBI investigation: this statement is based in part on contemporaneous notes written by? Reince Priebus, ding ding, ding!\\n6. Priebus wrote notes after discussing the Flynn FBi probe matter with Trump. If that wasn\\'t enough?McGahn\\'s recollections to HIS STAFF (=more contemporaneous witnesses) about what he personally told Trump Re: Flynn are also included in materials used to write the memo.\\n7. The above statement is corroborated by other records that the reporter was able to review. ALSO: people familiar with the matter told the reporter that BOTH Priebus &amp; McGahn have confirmed in separate interviews with Mueller that they DID tell Trump about FBI probe into Flynn.\\n8. See why that McGahn interview smack in the middle of the Flynn flipping news went on in two separate sessions? BC EVIDENCE. ANd Mueller was probably all \"see your colleague Reince testified the opposite of what you tried to claim here. \"\\n9. Naturally, Trump was told that Flynn was under FBI investigation by BOTH Priebus and McGahn BEFORE he met with Comey and asked him to \"let it go\". So this is pure unadulterated obstruction of justice, confirmed by MULTIPLE contemporaneous witnesses. LOL\\n10. Yates on Jan. 24, 2017 met with McGahn to warn him that US intelligence agencies had intercepted calls between Flynn and Kislyak and that they had discussed sanctions.\\n11. Yates underlined how Flynn concealed the truth from Pence, making Flynn vulnerable to Ryssian blackmail as the Russians knew the truth. LATER THAT SAME DAY McGahn BRIEFED TRUMP about what Yates had told him, per confidential WH records and interviews.\\n12. PRIEBUS was also present at the meeting (hence why, as we always explained, them having same lawyer means SAME version of facts).  the McGahn timeline demonstrates that Trump was CLEARLY informed during that meeting that Flynn was under criminal FBI investigation.  Oops.\\n13. \"Trump directed McGahn to find out more, including any information about the criminal investigation of Flynn, before deciding on a course of action-\" Narrator: Trump decided the course of action was to pressure Comey to \"let it go\". Yeah, intent to obstruct.\\n14. \"A person with first-hand knowledge told me that during interviews with the special counsel, both McGahn and Priebus confirmed that they had informed Trump during this meeting that Flynn was being investigated by the FBI.\" TWO direct witnesses.\\n15. Please note: McGahn LIED in his account to defend Trump, meaning quite certainly he was then FORCED too cooperate with Mueller in order to avoid repercussions.\\n16. \"Further, according to three current and former administration officials, McGahn also relayed to President Trump that Flynn had told the FBI the same false story he’d earlier told Pence (that Flynn had never spoken to Kislyak about sanctions)\" Oh. OH.\\n17. This means Trump KNEW Flynn had lied to the FBI, which is a felony. And yeah, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI when he flipped. YET he kept on lying about Flynn AND not only didn\\'t immediately fire him, but also asked Comey to stop the investigation.\\n18. Reporter: \"Additionally, my sources say that the special counsel also interviewed the two White House attorneys, John Eisenberg and James Burnham, who helped draft the McGahn memo, in which they, too, concluded that Trump was told that Flynn was under FBI investigation. \"\\n19. So literally EVERY legal representative in the WH PLUS Priebus and aides KNOWS Trump willfully obstructed justice AND told Mueller sp. IN case we\\'re not clear. Jolly good.\\n20. BOTH WH attorneys \"said that they questioned McGahn while researching the timeline; one of them independently recalled McGahn’s contemporaneously telling the president that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI\".\\n21. McGahn then on Jan 27 tried to play the \"but if we take action vs Flynn we might interfere with FBI prob\" with Yates. Yates was all \"um no honey, we\\'re not informing you and then expecting you to sit on your hands\".\\n22. The reason why Trump\\'s knowledge of the criminal investigation into Flynn is central to Mueller\\'s obstruction case is bc it clearly reveals and shows Trump\\'s INTENT to obstruct when he told Comey on the night of Jan. 27 to \"let it go\".\\n23. Jan. 27 is when Trump called Comey to invited him to dinner that evening at the WH. Per Comey\\'s testimony, he did NOT understand they would b ALONE until he arrived at the WH. Which obviously constituted a MAJOR problem as it was fully inappropriate.\\n24. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that Trump suggested to him at the dinner that his job might not be secure, leading Comey to believe that Trump was attempting to \"create some sort of patronage relationship\". (which was obviously nowhere near OK).\\n25. Per Comey \"A few moments later the president said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. \"  As we now all know.\\n26. On Feb. 8 the WaPo broke story that Flynn had indeed spoken to Kislyak about sanctions and that OOPS, there were receipts. In attempting to formulate a response, Priebus, McGahn, and Eisenberg questioned Flynn. Flynn\\'s story broke down but he was all \"I don\\'t remember\".\\n27. Priebus then specifically asked Flynn whether he was interviewed by FBI (per memos). “Flynn stated that FBI agents met with him to inform him that their investigation was over.” LOL SERIOUSLY? LIE! So at THAT point, Pence, Priebus and McGahn recommended Flynn be fired.\\n28. The rest is history we know as Flynn resigned on Feb. 13 to avoid being fired. The day AFTER, after ALL that had happened and Trump being FULLY aware of Flynn\\'s total guilt AND of the FBI investigation into Flynn, Trump pressured Comey to shut down the FBI Flynn probe.\\n29. Per known reports, Trump told Comey: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy.” Trump then repeated: “I hope that you can let this go.”  Pure obstruction.\\n30. Let\\'s be clear: by that point not only Trump knew full well that Flynn was extra dirty and had lied to the FBI... Flynn was gone so this wasn\\'t about Flynn AT ALL. This was about Trump being scared of what the FBI would find out ABOUT HIM ordering Flynn to act like a traitor.\\n31. Seukolow and Dowd willfully and blatantly lied to Mueller by exploiting the lie that caused Flynn\\'s firing, which was Flynn telling Priebus McGahn et al that the FBI only spoke with him to tell him the investigation into him had been closed. Incredibly stupid AND sloppy.\\n32. Sekulow and Dowd tried to pretend that Flynn\\'s false assertions were reported to Trump but there is ZERO information OR evidence in that sense. (of course). And even if? They KNEW Flynn had lied and knew straight from Yates, so LOL.\\n33. Buried Lede: \"Aside from McGahn, Eisenberg, and Burnham, the special counsel has interviewed FIVE OTHER attorneys who currently work for the White House counselor or have previously done so, according to administration records\" .

       " 'What do you tell your kids about borders? Crossing into Canada a few days ago, I warned my 9-yr-old, Saira (not her real name), not to giggle. Crossing was a breeze. Coming back, I said, would take longer...\\nEntering U.S. involved a lot more questions. The guard questioned Saira. Who is, as I said, nine. But she smiled a lot and all was ok; then he told us to turn off the car, &amp; Saira gasped. Border patrol were surrounding car next to us, hands on their guns, shouting...\\nOur guard had his hand on his gun, too, &amp; his eyes on the car. \"Out of the car!\" a guard barked. I was confused. It\\'d pulled up after us. There\\'d been no search, no time for search. They couldn\\'t have found drugs. A woman emerged...\\n\"About 28,\" Saira later estimated. Wore a nice white tank top, glasses. Latinx. Hands in the air. Face stunned and scared. They made her walk backwards, grabbed her arms. \"Are they going to--\" Saira asked. They did. They cuffed her.\\nThey repeated the drill with the man in the passenger seat. He kept glancing over his shoulder as he walked back w/ hands in air, &amp; they kept yelling at him, but he didn\\'t want to fall. Not a time for any mistakes. That\\'s when I made mine...\\nI took pictures. There\\'s a sign on the border booth forbidding cameras, &amp; I didn\\'t notice, so that part\\'s on me. The prohibition of documentation of armed agents of the state? That\\'s on the U.S. government. The guard, tho, blamed me...\\nHe grabbed my phone. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I said. I was w/ my daughter; not a time to invoke journalism. He held up his hand &amp; then began scrolling. Well past the two pics I\\'d just taken. Which constitutes an illegal search, no? I was more worried about my daughter...\\n\"Daddy,\" she asked, \"are you going to get arrested, too?\" I sighed. \"No,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think so, but I might lose my phone.\" This distressed her, too -- it was filled w/ our vacation pictures. \"Pull over,\" the guard said. \"Go through the green door.\"\\nInside was a room crowded, mostly with families. Not detained; paused. Some longer than others. There was no line. \"You wait for them to call your name,\" another dad explained. I noticed something; Saira noticed, too. They kept calling the white people...\\nWhy were white people called before the many non-white families who\\'d been waiting longer? You can guess easily as my 9-yr-old did, but the journalist in me can\\'t say for sure. That\\'s part of power: evidence of discrimination without certainty. Everyone guessing.\\nI\\'m not suggesting that the U.S. border guards had a deliberate plan to favor white people over non-whites. They just appeared to do so. They weren\\'t all white themselves. That\\'s how power works, too: the uniform is that of white supremacy.\\nI was worried about my daughter, of course. And that concern shaped something ugly in me: A hope that our whiteness would keep us out of further trouble. One more aspect of power\\'s control: it plucks the strings of the ugliest chords within you...\\nSure enough, after awhile a guard called us -- ahead of the black family &amp; the Asian family in between which we\\'d been sitting, both waiting longer than us. I went to the counter, glad &amp; guilty &amp; furious. A guard held our passports &amp; my phone...\\nI said what I believed needed to be said, especially with my 9-yr-old holding my hand: \"I\\'m sorry. I was stupid.\" The guard nodded, &amp; handed over our passports &amp; my phone. \"We deleted the pictures you took,\" he said...\\nNow, I can imagine some folks saying, \"I can\\'t believe you apologized to those fascists!\" To which I\\'ll say: That\\'s how power works. It makes you complicit. It makes you craven. I\\'ve experienced it before...\\nI\\'ve reported in countries where men with guns forbid pictures, &amp; I\\'ve had men point their guns at me &amp; order me to delete my pictures. But before I was a journalist, when I was 20, I crossed the Sahara with my older sister. We ran into trouble in Algeria...\\nThis was in 1992. A civil war broke out while we were there. An Islamic party had won a fair election, &amp; the gov\\'t had responded w/ tanks. Some 100,000 would die, but we didn\\'t see any fighting: just a vast crowd, trying to flee, like us, at a remote desert crossing...\\nWe were visibly American. A soldier separated us from the crowd. His rifle strap was too big for his frame, &amp; as he walked the gun slapped his ass. Bap, bap, bap. I was 20, dumb, &amp; I laughed. Bad move. My sister began apologizing. Then she said something in Arabic; he laughed...\\nI asked her what she\\'d said. \"I said, \\'My brother\\'s an idiot,\\'\" she told me. Soon, more soldiers surrounded us: delighted by the young American woman fluent in Arabic. (She\\'s an Arabic lit scholar.) They let me stand, but they made her tea...\\nThey offered her sugar &amp; asked if she was married &amp; what kind of man she wanted to marry &amp; if she might marry an Algerian man. She smiled. After three hours, they let us cross. Everyone else remained, inside the country collapsing into war. That\\'s how power works...\\nThe power of gender, of the men w/ guns who demanded flirtation as the price of crossing the border, &amp; of empire, the American one, that brought us to the front of the line, &amp; of borders, that put little tyrants in charge of lines in the sand...\\nSo even with the guns &amp; the yelling &amp; the confiscated phone, crossing back into the U.S. was a lot easier than out of Algeria, &amp; for that I was glad, &amp; ashamed. \"What happened to the couple?\" my 9-yr-old asked. I had to her I didn\\'t know, that I was afraid we couldn\\'t know...\\nI\\'m not reporting here, I\\'m just talking about crossing the border yesterday, on vacation w/ my daughter. Maybe that couple was wanted for real crimes, for all I know. But their car wasn\\'t searched. \"Was it like the kids?\" my daughter asked. She meant on the Mexican border...\\n\"It might have been,\" I said. She asked if we\\'d done something wrong taking pictures. \"No,\" I said. She pointed out I\\'d said it was stupid. \"Stupid because I got caught,\" I said. \"Stupid because I was with you. I\\'m sorry.\" \"It\\'s not your fault,\" she said. Which was true...\\nThe night before we\\'d watched The Hunger Games. (I know, a little much for a 9-yr-old. But she\\'d read the books, so...) We both thought of the evil \"Peackeepers\" &amp; their white uniforms, &amp; the shouting border guards in their black uniforms...\\nWhen we got to St. Albans, VT, we pulled over and went for a walk. I asked my daughter if she\\'d been afraid. She surprised me. \"No,\" she said. She thought for a moment. \"Mostly, I was burning with anger.\"\\nMy daughter knew we were lucky. She knew if she weren\\'t 9, I might have had a harder time, that if we weren\\'t white we might still be there. But the anger was personal, too. It was all mixed up. That\\'s how power works.\\nLater we came to a covered bridge on which someone had chalked \"Love=Rage.\" That fit her mood, &amp; the chalk was still there, so she added her own message: \"Keep our country colorful.\" That helped, but she was still mad.\\nBecause here\\'s the thing: We got off \"easy,\" right? White privilege, right? *Yes.* &amp; still it sucked, because of what happened &amp; because of the slime of fear &amp; complicity it left on us. I hear white liberals talk sometimes as if they\\'ve nothing to fear...\\n...as if the power of authoritarianism threatens only people of color. It threatens POC more; but it threatens *everybody.* That\\'s what authoritarianism is. You do nobody any favors by imagining you\\'re immune.\\nAs my daughter saw at the border, authoritarianism targets POC first &amp; most severely; the secondary goal of white supremacy, tho, is to keep white subjects in line through a mix of privilege &amp; subtle punishment for questioning that privilege.\\nAuthoritarianism cultivates paranoia &amp; self-censorship. It depends on us to internalize the ways in which it pushes around; it wants us to feel guilty for being afraid. It wants us to speak in the passive voice.\\nAnyway, before we got back on the road, I looked at my phone. Yes, they\\'d deleted the pictures I\\'d taken of border guards surrounding a Latinx couple; and, it seemed, they\\'d also deleted two previous, a pic of a mural &amp; a pic of my daughter smiling over a stawberry smoothie...\\nSo here\\'s a new picture. I don\\'t put my kids\\' pictures on the public internet, but with my daughter\\'s approval -- this is part of her \"burning anger\" -- here she is, adding her slogan, #keepourcountrycolorful, to one of which she approves, not far south of the border. https://t.co/aQLniu1USF',\n",
       " 'So, Twitter. In light of the ongoing clusterfuck that is #brexit, let me tell you a little about my white, Australian experience of dealing with the UK visa authority, a complete shitshow of a bureaucracy that is in no way prepared to handle what\\'s coming.\\nMy husband and I first moved to the UK in January 2011. He\\'d been given a position at a good university there - however, because the Tories had slashed the number of visas any uni was allowed to sponsor, they were unable to sponsor him even though they\\'d hired him.\\nFortunately for us, my maternal grandfather was born in the UK, which meant I was eligible for an ancestry visa. A much more expensive visa than a sponsored one would\\'ve been, but it came with greater protections and my husband could work as my spouse. So we opted to do that.\\nOf course, in visa-language, \"spouse\" is code for \"woman who does not work,\" so there was no designated space on my husband\\'s spousal visa application to include his offer of work. We had to put all that info in as an extra detail and hope they noticed.\\nThe whole process was expensive, labrynthine &amp; nervewracking, but in the end, we got to the UK. Fast forward three years, and our son is born in England in 2014. Because the UK has no jus soli, he has no British citizenship; we have to apply to have him recognised as Australian.\\nThis also means that we need to get him a passport so that he can one day leave the country. Which means travelling, in person, to a far-distant visa authority office, which is basically a warehouse, with an infant in tow.\\nWe were there for about SEVEN HOURS.\\nFun fact about visa authority offices: even though it\\'s legally required for children and babies to attend under various circumstances, they contain absolutely zero provisions for people attending with small children. Seven hours in a warehouse with no baby change tables.\\nWe were only able to get hot water to mix with my son\\'s formula by asking to use the employee kitchen, and even then, the guards wouldn\\'t let us in there; they brought us the water, with several frowning and lowkey chiding us as though we had any say in being there with him.\\nI\\'ll note, too, that consulates are similarly restrictive about the needs of babies, but at least they have the excuse of actual security risks to consider and try to run smoothly and on time to compensate for it. The UK visa authority warehouses? Not so much.\\nFastforward again to 2015: we\\'re living in Scotland and considering applying for permanent residency, which means taking the UK citizenship test. The visa processing centre in Aberdeen had been closed, so we had to drive five hours to the one in Dundee after prepaying etc online.\\nWe get to the Dundee centre. It\\'s basically a fancy shed: the entire thing is basically one open room on several levels with office dividers put up. It\\'s freezing cold outside. We, like many other applicants, have our toddler with us of necessity. But \"no babies allowed\" inside.\\nThis is justified because, as stated, the whole place is just a shed - there\\'s no walls between the testing &amp; waiting areas, and they don\\'t want child-noise to distract the test-takers. So anyone with a small child has to wait with them outside. IN SCOTLAND. IN WINTER.\\nIf an adult showed up alone with a baby? They would\\'ve been turned away. Parents who came in pairs had to take turns with their kid outside, where there was no shelter and no place to sit. In 4C weather, I saw a frozen woman cradling a baby in arms as she paced in the wind.\\nMy husband and I were \"lucky\" - we\\'d driven there, so we had the car to sit in. My husband went first while I waited in the car with our son. Fifteen minutes passed. My husband came back, visibly shaking. He hadn\\'t been allowed to even sit the test. Why?\\nBecause on the dropdown form he\\'d filled out online, he\\'d accidentally clicked that he was bringing a different type of valid ID to the one he\\'d actually brought. So even though he had valid ID on him, even though it was the matter of a single mis-checked box, they refused him.\\nNext, it was my turn. Now, at that time, my passport was still in my maiden name, because I\\'d got it just in advance of our wedding to go on our overseas honeymoon. This had posed no issue when getting my visa to the UK, or in opening a bank account there in my married name.\\nAs I\\'d done in every other instance, I\\'d brought my original marriage certificate with me, because all my utilities, bank statements etc referred to me by my married name. Again: this documentation had been sufficient to get me INTO THE ACTUAL COUNTRY and to work and bank there.\\nBut to sit the fucking citizenship test in a shed in Dundee? Oh, no. For that, I was told, only BRITISH marriage certificates could be accepted. Never mind that I was from a Commonwealth country: I was likewise deemed to have insufficient ID and turned away.\\nI asked if I could speak to a supervisor; no, there wasn\\'t anyone higher around than the woman I was dealing with. Could I call the relevant office for help? No; it was Saturday, nobody would answer. The office was closed. So we had to turn around and drive right back home.\\nOn the basis of this, we decided we didn\\'t want to stay in the UK anymore, but we still needed to renew our expiring visas. Which, as they were ancestry visas, meant:\\na) paying around £2000 for the three of us; and\\nb) sending in huge quantities of original ID documents.\\nThese documents included: all our passports, original marriage certificate, all our original birth certificates, my MOTHER\\'S original birth certificate, my GRANDFATHER\\'S original long-form birth certificate, bank &amp; utility statements, original work contracts - EVERYTHING.\\nBy the time we came to send this all off in late November 2015, my husband had a job offer back in Australia, so we planned to leave the UK in April - we only need the visas extended for the next five months. So we send our stuff off, and we wait.\\nAnd wait.\\nAnd wait.\\nWe can see from our bank statements that the UK visa authority has taken the £2000-odd pounds processing fee from us, but we\\'re into 2016 and haven\\'t heard anything - until, in late January, we get a letter telling us that our application and all our documents have been lost.\\nSpecifically: having received our application at their first processing centre, the visa authority took our money, made NO OTHER RECORD OF OUR APPLICATION, and then send our docs on to their other centre, via the REGULAR-ASS UNPROTECTED MAIL SERVICE, whose post depot flooded.\\nOurs was not the only application thus affected. In fact, we were later told by the Australian consulate, fuckups of this nature are *common* to the UK visa authority, who are apparently known for being careless with documents, slow, &amp; generally incompetent by other governments.\\nSo: we need new passports in order to leave the country. But to get new passports, we need new supporting documentation. And all those documents WERE ALSO LOST. And me? My passport is my only photo ID. So we had to get my mother IN AUSTRALIA to get a new birth cert for me.\\nWe then had to organise, and pay out of pocket for, a two-day trip to London (where the consulate is) FROM ABERDEEN, to get new passports in an expedited, not-reliant-on-the-Royal-Mail fashion. Which, again, cost us about £2000 out of pocket. It KILLED our savings.\\nIn the end, the UK visa authority refunded us for the application they couldn\\'t process, and returned our \"lost\" documents (which evidently weren\\'t destroyed by water after all) to us. But by then, it was late in 2016, almost a full year after we\\'d applied, and we were in Aus.\\nWe never recovered or were compensated for the additional £2000 we lost having to sort things out, and because of THEIR ERROR, the UK visa authority now flags all our passports whenever we enter the UK, because for some reason, they need a re-explanation of what happened.\\nThe entire 5 years we lived in the UK - as well-off, white, English-speaking, Commonwealth citizens - the UK visa authority was a hostile, incomprehensible, unpleasant, stressful entity to deal with. That\\'s it\\'s baseline mode: it is profoundly more vile to anyone less privileged.\\nIt\\'s a cold, hard fact that dealing with the UK visa authority trashed both my husband\\'s and my mental health and left us in a financial hole which, without the support of solvent, caring family members, we would never have climbed out of. Years later, we\\'re only just recovering.\\nHow an entity so comprehensively dedicated to intransigence and bureaucratic pettifogging can possibly hope to deal with the hugely expanded workload necessitated by a hard #Brexit is beyond me. They simply won\\'t cope, and any UK citizens wanting visas should beware.\\nIn all respects, the UK visa authority almost perfectly fits the description that Douglas Adams famously gave to his Vogons: \"Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous\" - the \"almost\" is because these days, yeah: they actually ARE evil, too.\\nIn conclusion: the marriage of xenophobia and bureaucratic incompetence is one of the ugliest in the modern world, and that\\'s saying something. The UK isn\\'t alone in perpetuating this particular evil, so let it be a lesson to everyone on a similar path to FIX THAT SHIT NOW.\\n\\nFIN',\n",

       " 'All right. I just finished the Mueller Report. I\\'m going to combine the most shocking and important revelations in one thread. Long and short: there was collusion, there was obstruction, Donald Trump needs to be removed from office. Immediately. 1/\\nMueller found that Russia was actively interested in electing Trump president, as early as his announcement, if not earlier. Operations began just as Trump Campaign took off. Obvious the two are parallel organizations that occasionally worked together, had the same goals. 2/\\nMultiple members of the Trump Campaign were approached by Russia. They were receptive sometimes, other times they just proceeded with knowledge that Russia was interfering on their behalf. They were not ignorant of the fact that Russia was interfering, not at all. 3/\\nTrump and Cohen continued work on Trump Tower Moscow deal while actively misleading the public as to whether he had business in Russia. He knowingly lied to the American public while Cohen worked with people who seemingly thought the hotel and the election were intertwined. 4/\\nPerhaps the most critical piece of information is that the Trump Campaign knew that the DNC emails were going to be released before they were. They had an active, multi-pronged plan in place to capitalize off the communications stolen by the Russian government. 5/\\nMueller found that Donald Trump, himself, knew that Wikileaks had the DNC emails before they were released and was in contact with campaign members and people outside of campaign and planned how to capitalize off their release. 6/\\nTrump\\'s call for Russia to find Clinton\\'s emails was fruitful. Within hours they followed his call and worked to find them. Despite saying it was just a TV stunt, he repeated the call off-camera. It was collusion in real time and in the light of public. No other way to say it 7/\\nAs for the Trump Tower meeting, Mueller believed that Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner committed crimes, but worried that courts would lose the thread on legal definition of the crime and wasn\\'t sure what the $ value of Clinton dirt was and if it was enough. 8/\\nPaul Manafort was especially lousy in the collusion front. He obviously had financial incentive and discussed battleground states with Russian individual, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, leading to suspicion that there were targeted efforts or interference. 9/\\nManafort discussing battleground states with Russia is really, really unsettling. There\\'s a ton of new ground here to cover and who knows what it led to and what can be proven. You could make an argument that this is possible what turned the election. 10/\\nIn terms of obstruction, it is quite obvious that Mueller was communicating that there were SEVERAL instances of obstruction, SEVERAL instances of attempted obstruction, and that Congress should address the issue. 11/\\nTrump actively wanted Mueller out of the investigation, said as much repeatedly. He wanted to fire him and worried that his appointment would be \"the end\" of his presidency. 12/\\nTrump repeatedly told his subordinates to obstruct justice. He had them contact the principals, including Comey and Flynn, in order to take their temperature and communicate what Trump thought. It was a giant game of illegal telephone. 13/\\nTrump repeatedly would call Comey, take his temperature, and try and get him to take it easy on Flynn. He had Reince Priebus contact Flynn, take his temperature, seemingly try and work him in order to keep his loyalty. 14/\\nMultiple people in Trump\\'s orbit declined to perform actions they thought were obstruction, including Chris Christie, who counseled Trump on how to not obstruct justice and watched him do it anyway. 15/\\nAfter it was revealed that Mike Flynn had illicit contact with Russia, Trump shook his hand and told him he\\'d be taken care of. It seems as if the exchange was a promise that Trump would help him with the fallout. 16/\\nTrump continually and actively addressed those in his orbit to either lie or coverup what they\\'d done wrong. He was constantly worried people would roll on him and constantly sought to get their stories straight in case of investigation. 17/\\nIn a bizarre situation, Trump said outloud that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him. He said he believed the AG position wasn\\'t independent. He wanted an individual who would \"protect him\" and wouldn\\'t mind keeping him illegal informed of investigations 18/\\nTrump knew that false testimony had been provided, particularly in Cohen\\'s case. He was aware of a crime being committed and allowed it. 19/\\nTrump wanted to obstruct even more than he did, but the only thing keeping him from doing so was that those around him didn\\'t want to be accessories to a crime. Don McGahn said he wanted him to do \"crazy shit\" and refused. 20/\\nNow, the big, big, big takeaways. Mueller wrote this report in such a way as to send a message that the investigation was not the end all be all of this matter. It\\'s obvious he was keenly aware that there was still much work to do in regards to both collusion and obstruction 21/\\nIn collusion, Mueller repeatedly mentions that he was hindered by the Trump team either lying or else not providing information. He said they destroyed evidence and stonewalled him. That\\'s why he couldn\\'t establish the charge in totality. 22/\\nIn terms of obstruction, Mueller was clearly putting the matter in the hands of Congress. This is a full and explicit layout of impeachable, high crimes. He was not intending Barr to steamroll over this thing. Not at all. 23/\\nWhat\\'s more, Barr not only lied, it appears he actively obstructed justice by misrepresenting the report in his summary. This wasn\\'t just a partisan structuring, it was an attempt to try and save Donald Trump and the administration. 24/\\nWhat William Barr did here is beyond disgusting and beyond shameful. He should be removed from office and there should be ramifications. This is, to put it bluntly, a massive and indefensible act of cover-up a systematic and overwhelming crime. 25/\\nThe Trump Campaign and the Trump Organization are criminal enterprises. The only difference between them and the infamous \"mob\" is that their crimes are explicitly white collar and international in nature. They acted with an intention to commit crimes, over and over. 26/\\nIt\\'s impossible to read this report and not notice how careful they were to skirt the line of collusion and obstruction. They were obviously aware of what they were doing and that this is even a matter of discussion is an indictment of our political and judicial system. 27/\\nThis last thing, I want to preface by saying I don\\'t say this lightly. It makes me unbelievably sad and depressed that this has happened. But we have a criminal president and he must be removed. It has to happen. 28/\\nFrom the moment Donald Trump announced his campaign he engaged in one unethical and criminal act after another. It\\'s in black and white that he and the people around him are happy traitors who put their wealth and power above the country\\'s wellbeing. 29/\\nTrump and his cronies made a decision to put power and wealth above the country. They actively sought help in undermining our democratic process. They didn\\'t report constant Russian contacts or offers to help. They\\'re traitors. That\\'s it. They\\'re traitors. 30/\\nWe can sit here and parse out legal definitions, but I don\\'t know how you get to anything else. We can talk about the word collusion or obstruction, but they actively sought help from a foreign adversary to interfere in the election of the Presidency of the United States. 31/\\nThe House of Representatives must vote to impeach Donald Trump. I don\\'t care if it won\\'t carry out in the Senate. It\\'s what impeachment exists to do. It\\'s their constitutional obligation to impeach him for high crimes. 32/\\nRepublicans have a duty to remove Donald Trump from office. They can hide behind partisanship all they want, but it\\'s right here in the open that he\\'s betrayed the company and broken the laws. They need to realize that duty is higher than party. And it needs to happen now. 33/\\nWe are in a crisis. We have to recognize that. Right now, we have a criminally compromised president. If he\\'s allowed to get through this unscathed, we\\'re never, ever going back. This is a four-alarm fire and we have to treat it as such. \\n\\nRight. Now. 34/\\nThere\\'s no defending this. There\\'s no spinning it. There\\'s no rebuttal that can put this away. This is a massive and unbelievable crime on a scale before unseen. We need to get rid of the Trump Presidency before it destroys us, before it rots us from the inside out. 35/\\nI take literally no pleasure from this. I\\'m extremely, extremely disheartened that a crime like this could take place on a scale this large. I really, really wish this would\\'ve been a hoax or a witch hunt, but it\\'s massive in scope and consequence. Trump has to go. 36/36',\n",
       " '1) I’m amused to see @JonahNRO scrambling for higher ground amid the insane tide of nutjob conspiracism that has overtaken the Right in the age of Trump. Amused, because Goldberg had no small role in conjuring up that tide, and still does. Thread follows.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/P3c4Xr6jkI\\n2) In addition to his role as editor of National Review’s online presence, Goldberg also has been living, ideologically speaking, from his book written a decade ago, ‘Liberal Fascism.’ I had a brief to-and-fro with him regarding its veracity at the time:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Mnaq704Hqm\\n3) I also organized a group of historians who actually specialize in fascism and put their essays together in a project at History News Network, to which Goldberg also responded (see links to all pieces at bottom of this intro):\\n\\nhttps://t.co/BlYXY1VfRW\\n4) One of Goldberg’s favorites tactics in responding to critics was to affect a high-minded superiority to his interlocutors, who were simply too stupid to comprehend the profound intellectual heights to which he clearly believed he had climbed.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/YTEhNOV06l\\n5) His critics made clear that his thesis – that “fascism is a phenomenon of the left, not the right” – is rubbish, reflecting eagerness to embrace fascists’ own propaganda while ignoring the recorded history of their actions, distinct from their words.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/AUJ8qgFF4e\\n5) One of the points he loved to repeat when promoting the book was that, well, he wasn’t saying all liberals were fascists and all fascists liberals, but rather he was just making a point so convoluted it became a nonsequitur. It’s right in the text: https://t.co/utmbBEiSor\\n6) Yet even as he made these and similar claims, he was appearing on right-wing shows promoted by pundits who in fact were quite eager to claim that all liberals or progressives were fascists. Foremost among these was Glenn Beck.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/I9iSr7liyg\\n7) Goldberg appeared on Beck’s show multiple times to promote ‘Liberal Fascism.’ With Goldberg there in the studio, Beck proceeded to claim that the progressive movement was fascist in its origins and in its behavior today. Bailouts were fascist. Health-care reform was fascist.\\nAt no point did Jonah demur. Indeed, he joined right in.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/kPrPI8vlrr\\n8) Eventually Beck produced a ‘documentary’ based on Goldberg’s book he titled ‘Live Free or Die’ that called the progressive movement a ‘cancer’ and blamed progressives for every genocide of the 20th century.\\nhttps://t.co/xeHqk99S8E\\nhttps://t.co/LtHOPyjL9x\\n9) At one point, Goldberg and Beck got together and counted all the ways that progressives and fascists were the exact same thing:\\nhttps://t.co/F58HArJPoQ\\n10) Flash forward nine years, and guess what? @DineshDSouza has cobbled together another right-wing bestseller that essentially replicates and updates Goldberg’s thesis. It’s titled ‘The Big Lie,’ and it features antifascists on the cover because they’re the _real_ fascists. https://t.co/4eSS0a3cQe\\n11) D’Souza doesn’t even attempt to demur with high-mindedness as Goldberg does. He nakedly calls Democrats ‘the real fascists’ and equates today’s liberals with 1920s Klansmen, which even Goldberg knew better than to attempt. (He just dismissed the KKK as a crazy movie fan club.\\n12) It came out two weeks before Charlottesville. And of course, everyone on TV that weekend saw the real dynamic we face: White nationalists bearing swastikas and Dixie flags, chanting Nazi slogans and Trump’s name and wearing MAGA hats, all battling black-clad antifascists.\\n13) This year, rather hilariously, D’Souza is hoping he can convince everyone that’s not what they really saw. With a new movie (‘Death of a Nation’) out in theaters spouting his thesis that Democrats are the real Nazis, D’Souza is gaslighting us.\\n14) He’s actually attempting to persuade everyone that what they’re seeing in Charlottesville this weekend is just two warring leftist factions. Seriously.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/x827A31OTI\\n15) Which is kind of undermined by all the Confederate flags and MAGA hats the organizers’ side like to carry. This year in DC it was American flags. Oh, and the fact that they named it “Unite the Right.” https://t.co/E0qlbKyPJz\\n16) I’ve covered a number of the right-wing Patriot Prayer events here on the West Coast, which lately have been featuring the violently pro-Trump hate group Proud Boys as their main muscle. They carry Trump banners. They make right-wing pronouncements. They are NOT leftists. https://t.co/XeFE5YWPLc\\n17) All this comes back to the point I raised with Jonah lo these many years ago, to wit: If we’re going to discuss fascism in America, oughtn’t we consider and examine the organizations that are expressly fascist and have mostly existed on the fringe of our politics since WWII?\\n18) There were openly fascist groups that operated in the 1920s and ‘30s, such as William Dudley Pelley’s Silver Shirts. Their direct descendants included William Potter Gale and Mike Beach, founders of the Posse Comitatus, and early neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell. https://t.co/6jKyDxTA0K\\n19) This fringe remained very much alive through the 1970s and 1980s thanks to movements like the Klan revival led by David Duke and the violent neo-Nazi skinheads. https://t.co/EWLlXEwzvH\\n20] They reshaped themselves a couple of ways in the 1990s as Patriot militiamen (essentially a version of white supremacist ideology rebranding and remaking its image for mainstream consumption) and pseudo-academic white nationalists of the Jared Taylor/American Renaissance ilk.\\n21) Today’s alt-right and militia “III Percent” movements, as well as the Alex Jones conspiracism that fuels all of these elements and provides them with their shared epistemological bubble, are direct products of these movements.\\n22) All of them are, and always have been, definably right-wing movements. There is nothing remotely left-wing about them, and never has been. D’Souza’s risible claims to the contrary notwithstanding.\\n23) These are the shoals of hard factual and historical reality upon which these revisionist attempts to reimagine fascism as somehow a left-wing phenomenon run aground.  They look frankly ridiculous when confronted with the presence of actual American fascists today.\\n24) Example: Patriot Front, the neo-Nazis who’ve been spreading fliers in your neighborhoods. They are explicit fascists who even use a fasces as their symbol. One of the fliers reads: ‘Making America Safe For Fascism Again.’\\n\\nhttps://t.co/iVpLzzEMjW\\n(More here.)\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Jj7jLeyScf\\n26) When not promoting the idea of fascism, the rest of the Patriot Front agenda is straight out of D’Souza’s own list of top favorite subjects: Stopping immigration, defending “western civilization,” attacking LGBT rights, attacking nonwhite civil rights and hate-crime laws.\\n27) So when he tries to claim that these are somehow “radical leftists,” he just looks stupid and foolish. But you know, that’s his call.\\n28) 25) This is, in fact, the point I made to Goldberg in my original review of  ‘Liberal Fascism’ for The American Prospect:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/iCmXlkNEXh https://t.co/JevZpmBCda\\n29) Goldberg was never able to provide a good reply. Rather, he just dismissed it with the immortal line: “Who gives a rat’s ass about the Posse Comitatus?”\\n\\nhttps://t.co/ZfXIjW1ZEd\\n30) Now Goldberg wants us to believe that, while the rest of movement conservatism appears to have been inundated by the tide of Trumpist insanity, there are still a few good old reliable _real_ conservatives rising above it all.\\n31) Yet at the same time, he himself is responsible for having unleashed much of this same insanity. Indeed, he not only gave rise to D’Souza’s crackpottery, he continues to endorse it himself, quite avidly:\\nhttps://t.co/fuL04i6kDE\\n32) He’s been called out for it by other conservatives, too:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/5oULoDGf2H\\n33) So just remember, when you hear Jonah moan about the difficulty of being a “good” conservative these days, that this is the same man who actively made the ugly little bed in which he now has to sleep – and he still give it a nice plumping daily.',\n",

       " 'Thread: On @POTUS\\'s Upcoming State Visit and the UK\\n\\n1. There is much intrigue in the air as @POTUS’s state visit to the UK approaches. Will he pressure the Brits to come clean publicly on their #Spygate complicity?\\n2. Will the Queen attempt a “charm offensive” in order to persuade him to not release any declassified #Spygate-related information that may incriminate British intelligence?\\n3. I find it particularly interesting that the Conservative Party’s house organ, the Daily Telegraph, published an article to try to get out ahead of the #Spygate revelations before the state visit. \\n\\n&lt;quote&gt;\\n4. Theresa May’s spy chiefs were secretly briefed on an explosive dossier of claims about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia before the US president was made aware of its existence, The Telegraph can reveal.\\n5. The heads of MI5 and MI6 and one of Mrs. May’s most trusted security advisers were told about former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele’s memos on the Trump campaign in the weeks after his November 2016 election victory.\\n\\n&lt;unquote&gt;\\n\\nSource: https://t.co/26pOmXRpkJ\\n6. “The Telegraph can reveal.” Why do you supposed they waited until just last Sunday to publish this article when surely the facts were known months ago – if not from the very beginning?\\n7. Always remember: the UK Deep State has been at it MUCH longer that the US Deep State. They’ve perfected an “us-versus-them” mentality in a society that was never classless to begin with. The UK’s political class and Deep State are where our political class takes its clues.\\n8. The UK Deep State is globalist-minded; so is the American political class. The UK is for “free trade” at the expense of their own people; so is the American political class. The UK has “socialized medicine” – and the attendant shortages in care – for decades; ….\\n8A. … the American political class (esp. the Democrats) have pushed Obamacare down our throats as a waystation on the road to a US-version of government-run medicine.\\n9. The UK has been on the anthropogenic global warming bandwagon from the very beginning. That’s where many of the first bogus climate models and databases were developed to influence political discourse on the subject; the American political class has followed their lead.\\n10. The UK political class has been rolling over for the Muslim invasion for years due to foolishly handing out British passports to virtually anyone from the old British Empire; who can deny that that’s essentially what the American political class has been doing in recent yrs?\\n11. There are townships in the UK that are no-go zones in which Sharia law dictates local rules. Here is one consequence of that invasion:\\n\\n&lt;quote&gt;\\n12. The UK tops even Sweden in Europe’s sexual assault and rape statistics. At 130.96 per 100,000 for sexual assaults and 50.68 per 100,000 for rapes, the United Kingdom is the most dangerous place for women in Europe.\\n13. One analysis claims that 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted and that 3.1% of women were assaulted in just the last year.\\n14. But then why do the numbers for nearby Ireland look so strikingly different? Like Finland, Ireland’s numbers are high, but nowhere near as high as those in the United Kingdom.\\n15. The UK’s sexual assault and rape rates are roughly four times as high as those of Ireland. And at 6.3% versus 1.4%, the difference in Muslim population percentages is in almost perfect proportion.\\n16. London, with its great diversity, has the highest rape rate within the United Kingdom.\\n\\n&lt;unquote&gt;\\n\\nRead the rest here: https://t.co/nx1stLEdUK\\n17. We’re moving in that direction in Somali-controlled areas of St. Paul, MN. Ask yourself how in the world did their come to be 74,000 Somalis in the Twin Cities area in the middle of America – except by Deep State design? One consequence? Ilhan Omar!\\nhttps://t.co/Zy9aUP6xIy\\n18. All the manifestations of the UK Deep State are mirrored and imitated by the American political class, including the implementation of double standards in the application of the rule of law, as well as the weaponization of government institutions against the people.\\n19. UK disdain for the US, as well as British meddling in US politics is not a new phenomenon. For example, Winston Churchill has been glorified in recent movies (The Darkest Hour is a really good picture, and Gary Oldman gave his best performance ever!).\\nhttps://t.co/xXvCNhmN5h\\n20. But there is another side of Churchill that has been hidden from public view to perpetuate the myth – his deep-seated enmity toward the US. A recent biographer of his was the first person to gain access to King George VI\\'s wartime diaries in the Royal Archives.\\n\\n&lt;quote&gt;\\n21. Although he had enjoyed his first trip to the United States in 1895, at age 20, Churchill’s initial attitude toward Anglo-American unity was sarcastic, bordering on the facetious.\\n22. In the 1920s, Churchill was highly critical of the United States’ determination to build a fleet equal in power and tonnage to the Royal Navy’s.\\n23. “There can really be no parity between a power whose navy is its life and a power whose navy is only for prestige,” he wrote in a secret cabinet memorandum in June 1927, while he was chancellor of the exchequer.\\n24. “It always seems to be assumed that it is our duty to humour the United States and minister to their vanity. They do nothing for us in return but exact their last pound of flesh.”\\n25. [H]is hostility to America was not known beyond the cognoscenti inside government, as he assiduously kept it out of his many speeches.\\n26. Churchill was clearly jealous of the leading position the Americans had assumed through their vastly superior production of war materiel by the spring of 1943.\\n27. “Winston is keen on an Imperial Conference,” the king noted that April, “so as to discuss the question of putting up a united British Commonwealth and Empire front to show the world and USA that we are one unity.”\\n28. “The Americans are always saying they are going to lead the postwar world.” \\n\\n&lt;unquote&gt;\\n\\nThere is more here: https://t.co/ezjJJ3KdKp\\n29. This secret bias perhaps begins to explain Churchill\\'s unqualified backing for the hyper-egotist and flaming asshole Field Marshal Montgomery against American Supreme Allied Commander GEN Dwight Eisenhower in major decision points for the prosecution of the War.\\n30. Churchill also appears to have had strong opinions about FDR’s socialist domestic politics and naive fondness for the \"heroic\" Stalin and the USSR.\\n31. Churchill also is controversial and less than fondly remembered by many Australians, who deeply resent the mass slaughter of their troops in Churchill\\'s flawed strategy and incompetent execution of the Gallipoli campaign against the Turkish Straits in 1915.\\n32. Some Aussies to this day call senior levels of British military and political leadership \"Pompies\" – a diminutive pejorative for \"Pompous Assholes\" (or \"Buffoons\").\\n33. The point of this is to remind us that the Brits may be long-standing allies, but they are not necessarily our friends. They have practiced realpolitick for centuries and are motivated by what best serves Britain (frequently at America’s expense!).\\n34. Getting back to @POTUS’s upcoming state visit, I have no doubt that the Brits wish to keep their intel agencies’ involvement in #Spygate secret, as that would blow the roof off both countries’ Deep State and political class collectives.\\n35. The Brit Deep State is trying desperately to keep the UK inside the EU, and an eruption of the complicity of UK intel agencies meddling in US politics would be an unwelcome diversion (to say the least!).\\n36. Prime Minister Theresa May has already been forced to resign (effective 7 June), and there are at least five candidates who are angling to be her replacement. I strongly believe that she will become the scapegoat for “UK Spygate” if/when the whole story goes public.\\n37. That will be her penance for having been the UK Deep State’s PM since 2016. And the UK will attempt preserve the “special relationship” with the US as best they can.\\n38. I’m not so sure that @POTUS will be very forgiving. In my opinion, he has a very welcome streak of vengeance and payback in him. I look forward to seeing how Trumpenfreude will be visited on the Brits, don’t you?  ///The end.',\n",
       " \"Let’s talk about Russia, because I think there’s a real cultural difference in how we in the West understand surveillance and what’s actually happening with Russian efforts so we have a hard time believing the depth of what’s going on.\\nMy parents are diplomats and they were posted to Russia. Before they left they deleted all social media and told my sister and I that the Russians would be watching us. My mum does property management stuff and my dad does tech and communications stuff.\\nIt sounds fancy, but basically my dad is the guy that you call when your printer isn’t working, and he does things like make sure firewalls are up and people are trained on new software. Mum figures out who’s gonna live where and gets them their furniture. Not high ranking stuff.\\nOne day mum looked up and saw a new smoke detector in the bedroom of their apartment in Moscow. Since she’s the property person, she would’ve known about a new smoke detector being installed in anyone’s unit. She would’ve organized it. This one was different from the others.\\nIt appeared magically. She had never organized this new smoke detector. There was no reason for it to be there. Cause it was installed by Russian surveillance. It wasn’t a smoke detector. Except at this point they’re so used to it she’s like “ugh, spies. Whatever.”\\nOne of her juniors came home early to her apartment one day to find four dudes sitting around her kitchen table playing cards. They wouldn’t talk when she asked who they were. They packed up and left and one of them shrugged at her on the way out.\\nAnother woman who worked with her got upset about her clothes in her dresser always being messed up when she knew she folded them. One day she said outloud “if you guys are gonna spy on me can’t you at least tidy up or something?” Next day when she came home her dishes were done.\\nOn the internet in 1998-1999 Russian citizens were generally very democratic and varied. In 2000 suddenly 60-80% of comments reflected totalitarian views. This is attributed to “web brigades” formed by the Russian State Security Service.\\nOh, you need historical context for this to really sink in. Putin was first named Prime Minister in August 1999, he was unpopular and not well known. A bunch of apartments were bombed and it was blamed on the Chechens. Putin used this to position himself as a strong leader.\\nYeltsin (Russian President at the time) announces his resignation on New Year’s Eve 1999. Putin is acting President up until the election in March. Putin ran almost no campaign and received 1/3 of all the media coverage, though there were 12 candidates for president. He won.\\nPutin is President from 2000-2008. Then he goes back to being Prime Minister until 2012, then he goes back to being President. Before all this he was a foreign intelligence officer until 1991 when he entered politics. He became Director of the Federal Security Service in 1998.\\nFederal Security Service (FSB) is responsible for internal security of the Russian state, counterintelligence, terrorism, etc. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies work under the FSB if necessary.\\nSo back to those web brigades in 2000. Organized and overseen by Russian State Security, also known as the FSB. Also known as the successor to the KGB. Also known as the agency that Putin just reformed before becoming Prime Minister and then acting President 4 months later.\\nIn 2012 a Russian hacktivist group publishes a bunch of emails belonging to a pro-Kremlin group including a number of government officials. Journalists discover that the pro-Kremlin group has been paying people to post comments, content, hijack blog ratings, etc.\\nIn 2013 Freedom House reports that 22 of 60 countries use paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions. Russia is at the forefront of this and has been for several years. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/XxtMQd2aQq\\nAlso in 2013 independent Russian journalists investigate the Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people at this time. The IRA hires young people to write pro-Kremlin stuff and smear US politics and culture. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/cnACLI7Tjl\\nThrough 2014-2015, journalists investigate troll armies as the Ukraine conflict escalates. One account found a twitter network of over 20,000 fake twitter accounts to spam negative comments about Ukraine. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/yHvOTCZ5pn\\nIn 2014 Russia expands its System of Operational-Investigatory Measures (SORM) laws to include social media activity. All telecommunications companies already have to track, record and store telephone, email and web browsing activity. This adds social media.\\nAlso in 2014 Russia passes the “Bloggers law”. Bloggers with over 3,000 daily readers are required to register and cannot be anonymous online.\\nAll orgs that provide platforms (like search engines, social networks, forums) must maintain computer records on Russian soil of everything posted in the past 6 months. Yes that means, Facebook, Skype, Google and Twitter.\\nAlso in 2014 public internet can no longer be anonymous. Anyone operating a public wi-fi network must identify users by their passport. This information must be stored for 6 months.\\nIn 2016 the Yarovaya Law is signed, Internet Service Providers must also track and store data according to the bloggers law AND disclose this data and “all information necessary” to authorities on request without a warrant or court order.\\nIn 2017 VPNs are banned in Russia. \\n\\nIn 2018 online messenger services that allow unidentified users are banned in Russia. \\n\\nIn 2018 messenger, email and social networks that allow encrypted data must allow the FSB to read encrypted messages without a court order.\\nHere's a nice simplified table to show Russian interference in countries that aren't just the US. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/ifv6fPbpqN https://t.co/iT2fuZidhX\\nOther things we know Russian web brigades have worked on include: \\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\\n\\nhttps://t.co/mFEin8IqeU\\nRussia trolls and bots are also part of the anti-vaccine rhetoric: \\n\\nhttps://t.co/sKLJnwFVSV\\nRussian trolls and bots got in on the Ford-Kavanaugh discussion: \\n\\nhttps://t.co/04MKBJTFiy\\nRussian trolls and bots on Syria, Obama, Black Lives Matter, and fortune telling! \\n\\nhttps://t.co/Tt95UXghCx\\nRussia is getting into your Netflix queue. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/wKCTnP73bV\\nRussia is on your pages, in your groups, in your comments.

when, and for what purpose? dim the light, boy, and let\\'s tread soft, for i like this not\"\\nas we crept upstairs, i began to share the old man\\'s misgivings. an occasional flicker betrayed a light ahead of us, and we could hear sounds - a steady tapping, like a marble against glass, and more unnerving still, what might have been low voices somewhere ahead\\nwe came to a ledge and a ladder. by now the light and low voices were palpable. i rested a little while to sketch the arrangement, then me and the old man crept forward on our bellies to assess our situation. https://t.co/bYcNsrdZFj\\nwe could hear two voices very distinct. \"damn you, captain blake\", said the first roughly, \"and damn your tales of silver. i didn\\'t sign on with you to labour down some sewer like a navvy. where\\'s this famous jade skull you promised, eh?\"\\nthe second voice responded in an insinuating purr. \"while i\\'m captain, dick, you\\'ll do as i say. wasn\\'t it all as the bald man\\'s chart predicted? didn\\'t that lead us, plain as day, to the cataract and the hidden door? stow your tongue, then, dick burstock, stow your tongue\"\\nthe old man crouching by me was trembling with excitement. \"smugglers!\" he whispered fiercely, on what seemed to me very inadequate evidence\\nthe old man signalled with a flick of his wrist, we dropped back a little to talk through our next steps.\\n\\n\"the captain mentioned a bald man\\'s chart\", said the old man. \"we need to get our hands on that chart. i\\'ll make a distraction, boy; then hie you to the captain\\'s trunk\"\\nwithout waiting for my reply, he dipped for a stone; then flung it, with more force than i\\'d imagined he was capable of. captain blake was standing alongside an antique candelabra, its top candles lit - all three candles went flying into the straw. the captain roared\\nthat was my signal. ducking through the shadows, i ran past capt. blake and dick burstock battling furiously with the flames, up to the captain\\'s concealed trunk. luckily it had been left unlocked. buried in the linings was the chart we sought.\\ni tried to run back the way i came. but dick burstock had turned from the fire to find water, and caught sight of my shirt-tails. \"Oi!\" he screamed, running to intercept me. my escape cut off, i doubled back, vaulting a pair of barrels and diving down a passageway\\nthe furious dick burstock was in hot pursuit; but luck of a sort was with me. i collided with a lever, which sent a portcullis tumbling down to block his path. i was away, and i had the chart, but i was cut off from my guide and in a strange place\\nhaving no lantern i guided myself with my phone\\'s torch; aware, however, that the battery would not last long. \"if there\\'s a path upwards i\\'ll take it\", i thought, and hummed a verse of \\'silver\\'s the blood of the moon, the moon\\'\\nbut the passageway showed no signs of turning upwards, although it seemed to widen, and the stonework seemed to become rougher. stranger still, i could hear a sound which reminded me of a tide lapping the shore. i rounded a corner and a curious sight indeed confronted me\\nit was what i can only describe as the strand of an underground ocean. the roof of the passageway suddenly lifted up very substantially; high up in it, I could see veins of silver picked out like constellations. the water stretched away further than i could see.\\nhauled up onto the shore was a sailing vessel, a death\\'s head flag hoisted from the mizzen-mast. \"so it was this which carried captain blake and dick burstock here\", i said to myself. there was a campfire smouldering alongside the boat; i moved the teakettle into place above it.\\ni needed to think carefully. my intention was to push out in the boat and seek a further shore. but what were my responsibilities to the old man? if he hadn\\'t been discovered, would he be able to make his own way back down the passage to our \"diggins\", and from thence the shop?\\nand then, what if he *had* been discovered? surely it was my responsibility to assist him. but how? the knife on captain blake\\'s belt proclaimed him a deft close-quarters opponent; i had no weapon, and doubted my strength. \"what would gayle do\", i wondered\\nthere was another consideration; if i went back and rescued the old man, it seemed inevitable that blake and burstock would be able to regain the boat. this, perhaps, was our only chance to get a jump on the ruffians. \"forgive me, old man\", i whispered as i pushed off the boat\\nhaving made my decision, i explored the boat. there were two cabins; one, cramped and filthy, clearly belonged to the wretched burstock; the other, velveteen and luxurious, to none other than captain blake. i stowed my gear in the captain\\'s cabin and headed up to take the wheel\\na very large nugget of silver in the \"roof\" - some hundred metres above me - provided enough light to steer by. i hoisted the mainsail and the prow cut through the water, crisp and easy\\ni set my course in the direction which seemed most promising, and then unfurled the bald man\\'s chart. i could plainly see the \\'cataract\\' and the \\'hidden door\\' the captain had mentioned. more puzzling was the sketch in the bottom corner of an ominous creature https://t.co/36HdoJ8obX',\n",

It’s what advertisers pay billions for.

That they were okay with them having access to this for YEARS?  PLEASE.\\n-Facebook was embedded in the campaigns (they helpfully offered this), working with the stolen data.

If they also had access to health data (which I think they did), they could target people with mental illness.\\nMicrotargeting is achieved by uploading a custom audience to the Facebook ad manager - meaning, after they\\'ve found all the ppl in say, Pennsylvania who\\'ve used the word n***er in their private messages, they separate these people from everyone else.\\nThen they run ads targeting these people and only these people.  They don\\'t have to waste money casting a wide net and seeing what sticks.  They already know what will stick.\\nThen, with a pixel (basically, a tracker placed on a website), they can see if the person has visited the sites they\\'ve linked to.  They could see if these people were sharing stories, liking, clicking, or commenting.\\nAnd they could target these people over and over and over and over: because you can then create ANOTHER custom audience based on behaviors from your FIRST custom audience.\\nThey could have Trump coordinate his messaging in speeches with what was being run in these ads, and what was being covered on the news - all the news, not just Fox - 24/7 because, ratings.\\nRemember how Trump kicked off his campaign with disgusting comments about Mexican human beings?  What he said to Megyn Kelly on live TV?  He was talking to his custom audience, all cued up in the Facebook ads manager, and ready to go.\\n(by the way, people on the far left were targeted too)\\nContinuing: they achieved social proof with an army of trolls and bots who made it look like many other people agreed with these extreme ideas, and look like the fake news was legitimate.  The trolls and bots shared the links, made comments on fake and legitimate news articles.\\nTrolls even created fake events and attempted to create situations in which violence would erupt (and then be covered extensively, and used to further push the narrative of ppl of color and/or on the left being thugs).\\nSocial proof was solidified, and Cambridge Analytica got to refine their stolen data even more, by luring vulnerable people into private groups where they could ask them questions and encourage them to take action.\\nIn the end, it was 70,000 people - people with a specific psychological profile, which they had access to because they\\'d stolen it - who swung key states.\\nIf you think this is impossible, consider that companies convince people on a daily basis to leave their homes and buy a $30,000 car.  WITHOUT stolen data about the most intimate parts of their lives.\\nAnd WITHOUT these people being afraid that their very lives depend on buying a car/going to McDonald\\'s/shopping at Walmart-Mart.\\nI\\'d posit that the rest were filled in by people who told everyone \"he doesn\\'t mean what he\\'s saying\" and stood to gain the most from what Trump was promising: rich, white straight men.\\nAnd they just got what they were promised - a giant cash grab that goes against what every so-called conservative has said they believe in.\\nAnd let\\'s not forget the far religious right!  See: Council for National Policy.\\nThere was a reason Trump had little to no ad spend in other areas of media, like TV.  He didn\\'t need it.  They had a STOLEN profile of just about every single American - likely down to their bowel movements - and used those profiles to manipulate those who were vulnerable.\\nSo, in summary, this is a BFD.  And it was only ONE of the things they were doing, as we\\'re finding out. ||END||\\nSorry, just wanted to add one more thing.  This is another important question we need to ask: who ELSE has this data now? and WTF are they doing to us with it?\\nIf you haven\\'t read or watched the stories, Facebook didn\\'t ask CA to do anything about the stolen data until August of 2016 - YEARS after it had happened.  Even then, they didn\\'t follow up, AND the named source (Wylie) has stated that this data was EMAILED, UNENCRYPTED.\\nLooks like the NRA works with Cambridge Analytica.

       " '(THREAD) New evidence suggests Rick Gates\\' plea has much more to do with Russia than we thought.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s because it may have more to do with Trump advisor Erik Prince and Trump fundraiser/RNC deputy finance chair Elliott Broidy than we thought.\\n\\nHope you\\'ll read on and share. https://t.co/TGqLdgXmx9\\n1/ When Gates pleaded guilty, the White House insisted his crimes had nothing to do with Trump or Russia. But it\\'s increasingly clear the reason Mueller offered Gates a plea deal did in fact have to do with Russia-related information Gates had about not just Manafort but others.\\n2/ First, understand how significant Gates was to Trump\\'s campaign: he was its Deputy Campaign Manager; he ran its operations at the RNC, where Trump campaign aides made contact with Russian nationals and subsequently changed the RNC platform to benefit Putin and lied about it...\\n3/ ...per media reports, he was effectively running Trump\\'s campaign—more so than Manafort—for several months in the summer of 2016; when Manafort was fired, Trump stayed in contact with his former Campaign Manager and declined to fire Gates, instead giving him a critical role...\\n4/ ...as his campaign\\'s liaison to the RNC, a move which at the time surprised political observers because (a) that was a critical campaign role, and (b) it was assumed that Gates, Manafort\\'s deputy, would\\'ve been removed from the campaign at the same time Manafort was because...\\n5/ ...like Manafort, Gates had ties to the Ukraine and therefore should\\'ve been as big a liability as Manafort was—by then—thought to be, at least publicly; Trump then made him Deputy Chairman of his inaugural committee (a key role) during the transition, which we now know was...\\n6/ ...lousy with secret meetings and calls with Russian nationals—even as Trump (and, one presumes, let\\'s be honest, Gates as well) stayed in touch with Manafort behind the scenes (and of course Trump and Manafort lived in the same building and could meet up whenever they liked).\\n7/ So Gates was at the top of Trump\\'s campaign and transition; was at the top of the campaign and transition at all points at which suspicious Trump-Russia contact occurred; and was definitively tied to that contact, at least in terms of the lied-about platform change at the RNC.\\n8/ But Trump\\'s decision not to fire Gates in mid-2016, but put him in a key position as the link between himself and the RNC, never sat right with me, or with many others in the media. Gates came in with Manafort and had all the same liabilities; so why didn\\'t he go out with him?\\n9/ Indeed, Trump responded to the *loss* of Manafort (against Trump\\'s wishes, and only in public, to be clear) by *promoting* Manafort\\'s equally compromised deputy to a position of even *greater* prominence and power than he had before—which he stayed in through the inauguration.\\n10/ And now Rick Gates has pleaded guilty.\\n\\nImmediately after that happened, sources in the White House successfully got the media to pass on (essentially without analysis) two lies: (a) Gates wasn\\'t a particularly prominent Trump-campaign figure; (b) he\\'d no knowledge of Russia.\\n11/ But you know who Gates was linked up with as a result of Trump shocking the media and naming him his RNC liaison? The man pictured atop this thread, Elliott Brody, who less than 90 days after Gates ceased to be Trump\\'s RNC liaison became the deputy finance chair of the RNC.\\n12/ Days after Gates was indicted, McClatchy reported Mueller was looking into new charges against Gates involving a shady film-production scheme. As part of that scheme, two producers sent $100K in fraudulently-obtained funds to a nonprofit run by Broidy. https://t.co/icEmpkKN2f\\n13/ That wasn\\'t the first time Gates was involved with Broidy: Broidy was Vice Chairman of the Trump Victory Committee during the 2016 campaign, a joint operation between Trump and the RNC, which linkage therefore—per Trump\\'s surprising summer promotion of Gates—was run by Gates.\\n14/ As soon as the campaign ended, Gates and Broidy continued working together, this time on Trump\\'s inaugural committee—for which Broidy was the Vice Chairman and Gates the Deputy Chairman. So the compromised-by-Ukraine-cash Gates was hand in glove with Broidy for *many* months.\\n15/ And after he worked with the compromised-by-Ukraine-cash Gates for many months, Broidy was rewarded by the RNC with a promotion of his own—to deputy finance chairman. So Trump saw to Rick Gates\\' elevation, and the RNC saw to Broidy\\'s. Both sides of that partnership prospered.\\n16/ Three weeks ago, a story dropped suggesting that Broidy\\'s wife was trying to collect millions of dollars in return for influencing Trump Administration policy. https://t.co/G2LywcD580\\n17/ Two days later, the George Nader news dropped—Nader, a Trump insider-turned-Mueller-informant, established that Erik Prince had lied about his Trump-sanctioned secret meeting with a Russian in the Seychelles—and Nader was immediately tied to Broidy too.https://t.co/AAdmt9y45v\\n18/ Lest you wonder if Broidy is only connected to Nader, not Prince, understand first that Broidy is in the same niche industry as Prince—private Middle East military contractors—specifically in the UAE, which is where Prince lives. He\\'s tied to the UAE royal family—like Prince.\\n19/ But wait! I\\'m just getting warmed up. Just four days after the Broidy-Nader scandal (which itself was two days after Broidy\\'s wife\\'s scandal), this bombshell dropped: Broidy was possibly connected to a scandal involving (wait for it) Russian sanctions. https://t.co/PEHVGrzchd\\n20/ According to docs held by a Ukrainian prosecutor, Broidy has been acting as an agent of a sanctioned Kremlin-owned bank—in other words, the Kremlin. And the media reports Broidy has \"significant access to Trump\" and is lobbying him. On what? Why, Russian sanctions, of course.\\n21/ That\\'s right, Broidy appears to be lobbying Trump to do just what Trump has done: slow or avoid the imposition of any new Russian sanctions, and militate publicly for an end to all sanctions on Russian entities. Thank god there\\'s no evidence that Broidy is giving Trump money!\\n22/ (Surely, if you\\'re reading this, you know what\\'s coming next.)\\n23/ Broidy has been a major Trump fundraiser since 2016, and the money sure didn\\'t stop flowing once (allegedly) Broidy began working for both the RNC and—apparently—Putin\\'s VTB Bank.\\n\\nOne week ago Broidy hosted a $35,000-a-person fundraiser (!) for Trump. https://t.co/y995863cZw\\n24/ The Al-Jazeera investigation linked to in this thread implies that Mueller now could be investigating Broidy—who, again, apparently has shady ties to both the Kremlin, the RNC, Ukraine, Erik Prince, and the UAE—for FARA violations and more. And who could help him? Rick Gates.\\n25/ (I wish I could tell you this thread is about to get *less* complicated, but it\\'s about to get *more* complicated. But also *absolutely stunning*.)\\n26/ Trump (and Jared) are surrounded by a horde of fundraisers and advisors who are trying to lobby Trump not just about private military contractors in the Middle East but, more significantly, about *nuclear power* in the Middle East.\\n\\nSpecifically, gifts of U.S. nuclear tech.\\n27/ Rick Gates is part of that horde. And so is another man Mueller has in his pocket due to a plea: Michael Flynn.\\n\\nTrump pal Thomas Barrack is also in that horde. So is Bud McFarlane, who was a VIP at Trump\\'s Mayflower Speech in April 2016. So is Broidy. https://t.co/5cxOxnfL0f\\n28/ So now we have a story involving Gates, Flynn, Prince, Broidy, Barrack, McFarlane, Kushner, Nader, and Donald Trump. But guess what: it all comes back to Russia and the UAE, the two parties Prince secretly met with and lied about meeting with while under oath before Congress.\\n29/ If you read the ProPublica story, you\\'ll see the UAE can only get U.S. nuclear tech if we give it to Saudi Arabia first. Trump\\'s pals are all either working to get that tech to Saudi Arabia or lobbying on behalf of the UAE—which, as to nuclear tech, amounts to the same thing.\\n30/ What does this have to do with Putin and sanctions? That\\'s a reasonable question to ask.The answer: Moscow wants the contracts to build all new nuclear power plants in the Middle East, and stands to make *hundreds of millions* doing so.\\n\\nJust one thing stops them: sanctions.\\n31/ Yesterday the Saudi Crown Prince, who wants our nuclear tech, which would allow it to flow also to the UAE, which would make Putin hundreds of millions—but only if sanctions are dropped—said this about Jared Kushner: he\\'s \"in my pocket.\"\\n\\nProcess that. https://t.co/op1dN9MEM2\\n32/ Does this change your view of why Kushner secretly met the Russian ambassador at Trump Tower in December 2016—he smuggled him in the back door—to discuss setting up a secret backchanel to Putin? While Gates and Broidy were running the inaugural committee and lobbying Trump?\\n33/ Does this change your view of the pending (unanswered) question about where the \"extra\" tens of millions of dollars raised by Gates and Broidy for the inauguration went? https://t.co/qMTiAkPVRt\\n34/ Does this change your view of today\\'s news about Broidy allegedly helping Moscow companies lobby Trump on sanctions?\\n\\nDoes it change your view of whether Mueller wanted Gates under plea for reasons (as the White House says) entirely unrelated to Trump? https://t.co/uxrVkk6MoI\\n35/ Gates and Flynn have a lot to tell Mueller, and we should assume they\\'ve told all of it. We should further assume Broidy and Kushner are in Mueller\\'s path and that at least one will roll on Trump. We should assume all pending UAE-Saudi Arabia scandals are equally about Putin.\\n36/ I\\'ve said this from the day I first read Chris Steele\\'s dossier 14 months ago: Trump sold U.S. policy on Russia for money, and he did it before the campaign started (2013 in Moscow), during the campaign (his 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal) and while in office post-January 2017.\\n37/ Yesterday\\'s big news from the New York Times is of course part of all this, as it underscores that Trump\\'s clandestine arrangement with Moscow flowed (much if not all the time) through negotiations with the UAE and Saudi Arabia—often via his top aides. https://t.co/uGys0TGYdx\\n38/ Trump is toast. Not because he\\'s an asshole, though he is; not because he\\'s a Republican, which (in fact) he isn\\'t; he\\'s toast because he\\'s one of the biggest traitors in the history of the U.S. and Mueller has *at least* three key witnesses *already* who can testify to that.\\n39/ Now you know why Trump hired Joe DiGenova—who wanted Comey prosecuted and will pull the same BS on Mueller. You know why he\\'s hiring DiGenova\\'s wife Victoria, who spread the Uranium One hoax—he\\'s going to go after Clinton. You know why he hired Bolton—he\\'s going to go to war.\\n40/ Trump knows he\\'s toast, which is why he\\'s preparing for two wars: a war on the rule of law here at home, and a senseless war abroad, in either North Korea or Iran. All of it is to save himself—he thinks—by delaying what at this point is inevitable: his fall from power. {end}\\nUPDATE/ I was one of the louder voices online outlining why DiGenova and Toensing had too many conflicts to work with Trump—due to other Trump-Russia clients and DiGenova\\'s alleged role in blackmailing Comey to reopen the Clinton case. Well, look at this: https://t.co/VRDLud9wg1\\nNOTE1/ What Joe DiGenova and his wife are learning, which most of us lawyers learned in law school, is that a client can waive an *apparent* conflict of interest, but an *actual* conflict of interest must be avoided by a lawyer at all costs—per the Rules of Professional Conduct.\\nNOTE2/ Representing Clovis, Prince, and Corallo is an *actual* conflict of interest for DiGenova and his wife that can\\'t be waived by the clients and can\\'t be allowed by DiGenova and Toensing. Their clients (and they) have info on facts and strategy Trump wants and needs to know.\\nNOTE3/ When I say Trump is \"toast,\" please (I ask you) do *not* add the word \"imminently\" after it in your mind—as I didn\\'t say that and don\\'t believe it and am sick of being misquoted. The writing is on the wall for Trump, but it\\'ll take *many* months for this to come to a head.',\n",
       " '‼️Firtash Boeing Titananium\\n\\nDmytro Firtash’s is an Ukrainian Oligarch. His wealth stems in large part from the lucrative natural gas trade in Ukraine, whose pipelines have long served as the key conduit for Russian gas supplies heading to Western Europe.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/VdFYx7AE83\\nFirtash is also considered an important financier of the Party of Regions political party, and was involved in hiring Manafort, then a U.S. political consultant and lobbyist, in 2005 to help rebuild the party. \\nhttps://t.co/VdFYx7AE83\\nThis was after its then-leader, Viktor Yanukovych, was defeated following the 2004 Orange Revolution.\\nhttps://t.co/VdFYx7AE83\\nUkrainian prosecutors are currently investigating Firtash’s involvement in the notorious privatization of the monopoly provider Ukrtelecom, which was carried out without a competitive tendering process and accompanied by financial machinations.\\nhttps://t.co/TZBryKjDqc\\n📌At the time, Firtash’s reputation was seriously damaged as his name kept cropping up in connection with Russian organized crime - Semion Mogilevich. \\nhttps://t.co/TZBryKjDqc\\n📌Firtash, as documented by WikiLeaks files, once confided to the US ambassador that he had made use of Semion Mogilevich’s services to protect his business from attacks by competitors.\\nhttps://t.co/TZBryKjDqc\\nThe DOJ has identified Dmytro Firtash, as a former biz assoc of Manafort &amp; an \"upper-echelon [associate] of Semion Mogilevich a Ukrainian-born, Russian organized crime boss, believed to be the \"boss of bosses\" of most Russian Mafia syndicates in the world\\nhttps://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi\\nIn 2008, according to court records, Manafort\\'s firm was involved with Firtash in a plan to redevelop the Drake Hotel for $850 million. Firtash\\'s company planned to invest more than $100 million.\\nhttps://t.co/J9MeiVewFW\\n📌Manafort’s partner on the deal was the former exclusive broker for Fred Trump\\'s (Trump’s father) properties, Brad Zackson.\\n\\n📌Firtash\\'s investment company transferred $25 million into escrow to further the project.\\nhttps://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi\\n📌Also in 2008, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, Semion Mogilevich, according to a classified DOS cable [released by WikiLeaks]\\nhttps://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi\\n📌Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine.\\nhttps://t.co/wX45ZbHVMt\\n📌Firtash was a major backer of Ukraine\\'s Party of Regions, the pro-Russian party for which Manafort worked for many years. \\n\\n📌Manafort\\'s firm made more than $17M in gross revenue from the party in just two years, according to his recent FARA filing. \\nhttps://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi\\n‼️Firtash - Boeing Dreamliner - Titanium\\n\\nFirtash has been wanted in Chicago since 2014 for his alleged role as the mastermind of an international titanium racket.\\nhttps://t.co/lJWENJtECb\\n📌The case initially attracted int’l interest because of Firtash’s ties to  Putin &amp; Mogilevich. \\n\\n📌It is significant in light of Manafort’s indictment on charges of failing to register as an agent of former pro-Russian Fmr Ukrainian President\\xa0Yanukovych, \\nhttps://t.co/lJWENJtECb\\n‼️More Backstory: \\n\\nFirtash’s  success was built on remarkable sweetheart deals brokered by associates of Russian leader Vladimir Putin (Semion Mogilevich) at an immense cost to Russian taxpayers, \\nhttps://t.co/CWyqJiPQPY\\n📌Gazprom sold more than 20 billion cubic metres of gas well below market prices to Firtash over the past four years (since 2010)  - about four times more than the Russian government has publicly acknowledged. \\nhttps://t.co/CWyqJiPQPY\\n📌The price Firtash paid was so low, Reuters calculates, that companies he controlled made more than $3 billion on the arrangement.\\nhttps://t.co/CWyqJiPQPY\\n‼️Titanium: \\n\\nThe Cyprus offshore company Tolexis Trading Limited, part of Group DF owned by exiled Ukrainian billionaire Dmytro Firtash retains one of its most valuable assets, the Zaporizhzhya Titanium and Magnesium Combine.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpCkkb\\n📌The only producer of titanium sponge in Ukraine and Europe is located in Zaporizhzhya, the provincial capital of 750,000 people located some 550 kilometers southeast from Kyiv.\\n\\n📌Ergo Firtash [Mogilevich) controls the entire Titanium market. \\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpCkkb\\nIn 2013, under the era of corrupt President Viktor Yanukovych, a Firtash ally, the state-owned Zaporizhzhya combine was privatized &amp; became a limited liability company.\\n\\nFirtash’s biz empire, enlarged during the reign of Yanukovych, remains largely intact.\\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpCkkb\\n📌While a 51 percent stake was still owned by the state, the remaining 49 percent was transferred to Firtash’s Tolexis Trading Limited, which won at that time the competition organized by the State Property Fund of Ukraine.\\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpkJsD\\nUnder the terms of the signed contract, Firtash’s company had to contribute $110 million to the authorized capital of the plant solely for its modernization.\\n\\nBut as it turned out, that did not happen\\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpCkkb\\nThe investigation found that despite the fact that during 2014-2015 Tolexis Trading Limited allocated $110M to the combine, only $1.2M , went for modernization. \\n\\n📌The rest was allegedly withdrawn through offshore accounts, as the Ukrainska Pravda\\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpCkkb\\n📌On March 12, 2019 the Supreme Court of Ukraine was about to make a final decision. However, the judge took a break until March 15, and then took a sick leave before ultimately making the decision in favor of the oligarch.🤔\\nhttps://t.co/y9avtpCkkb\\n📌Boeing -Titanium\\n\\nBoeing was in a tight spot. Just as it was preparing to roll out its innovative 787 Dreamliner, the plane that was supposed to lead the Boeing into the future — a shortage of strong but lightweight titanium parts threatened production.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nIn 2006, as titanium prices rose, Boeing asked McKinsey &amp; Company to evaluate a proposal, potentially worth $500 million annually, to mine titanium in India through a foreign partnership financed by an influential Ukrainian oligarch—Firtash.\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n📌McKinsey says it advised Boeing of the risks of working with Firtash and recommended “character due diligence.” \\n\\n📌McKinsey described what it said was the potential partner’s strategy for winning mining permits. It included bribing Indian officials.\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nFirtash’s plan McKinsey noted, “respect traditional bureaucratic process including use of bribes.”\\n\\nMcKinsey also wrote that the partner had identified 8 “key Indian officials” named in the PP slide, whose influence was needed for the deal to go through. \\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n📌Nowhere in the PowerPoint slide did McKinsey advise that such a scheme would be illegal or unwise. \\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nThe story of McKinsey’s role in the episode has remained hidden from public view for 12 years.\\n\\nThe firm’s ultimate recommendation and how its client, Boeing, responded remain something of a mystery, cloaked in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. \\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n📌When Boeing went looking for titanium in 2006, it tentatively agreed to buy the metal through a company controlled by Mr. Firtash, who had made billions of dollars brokering gas sales to Ukraine from Russia and former Soviet republics.\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n📌The deal did not end well.\\nThe mining venture never materialized, but Mr. Firtash was indicted on charges of directing $18.5 million in bribes to Indian officials for mining permits.\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nChicago feds recently revealed the tantalizing detail that they have “thousands of intercepts” of Firtash and his alleged co-conspirators in the titanium scheme.\\nhttps://t.co/lJWENJtECb\\nAdding to his revelation that the U.S. secretly recorded a phone call in which Firtash discussed a co-defendant\\'s trip to Chicago to meet with Boeing executives, \\nhttps://t.co/lJWENJtECb\\nBhachu said the government has \"tens of thousands\" of documents and \"thousands of intercepts\" that can be used against Firtash.\\nhttps://t.co/lJWENJtECb\\nNeither McKinsey nor Boeing have been  charged in the case, and Boeing has not been accused of paying bribes. \\n\\nBut several employees of the two companies are believed to have testified before a grand jury. \\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n‼️The Hunt for Titanium\\n\\nTitanium is a strategic defense material, managed under law by the DOD &amp; its use &amp; procurement is subject to US defense mandates &amp; laws\\nhttps://t.co/ObyiB9W4Th\\n‼️Uses of titanium sponge? \\n\\n* Landing gear, springs, rotors (helicopter), fittings, and attachments\\n\\n* Structural components for airplanes, satellites, and spacecraft\\n\\n* Gas turbine engines\\n\\n* Chemical processing\\nhttps://t.co/ObyiB9W4Th https://t.co/z3dMl1daIV\\n🌳The Fight to Extradite\\n\\nIn June 2013, a federal grand jury in Chicago secretly indicted Mr. Firtash and five others, including an Indian official, on bribery charges. \\n\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nUntil a Russian billionaire, Vasily Anisimov, posted Firtash’s  $174 million bond. Mr. Anisimov is an associate of Mr. Putin’s friend Arkady Rotenberg.\\n\\nSo began a highly unusual four-year tug of war between two allies — the United States and Austria. \\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nExtradition requests between the United States and other Western nations are almost never rejected, said Lanny J. Davis, one of Mr. Firtash’s (&amp; Michael Cohen’s) lawyers and a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton.\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n🚩Oct 2018: The European Union’s top court turned away an appeal by Dmytro Firtash, the latest twist for the Ukrainian oligarch whose extradition from Austria the United States has been fighting for since his 2014 arrest in Vienna.\\nhttps://t.co/VdFYx7AE83\\nDan Webb, one of Mr. Firtash’s lawyers and a former United States attorney in Chicago, said his client had nothing to do “with the creation or presentation of the PP slide proposing bribery and used by U.S. prosecutors to support extradition of Firtash.” \\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\nFor its part, Boeing said in a statement that it had cooperated with the Justice Department and was “not accused of any wrongdoing.”\\nhttps://t.co/19L5fMIxyw\\n📌Side note: Russia’s VSMPO-Avisma (https://t.co/V0FgmOutY8), the world’s largest titanium producer, and U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N) have launched a new manufacturing unit in Russia’s Urals region of Sverdlovsk\\nhttps://t.co/0pTiEzRmLb\\n‼️Firtash Order Unsealed 6/21/19 Motions to dismiss DENIED.
