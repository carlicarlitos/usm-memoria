       " '6. An anon responding to Q\\'s question \"Who performs in a circus?\" (I thought the answer was CLOWNS), mentioned Snowden\\'s girlfriend. Q asks who the father is. His name is Jonathan Mills (need to dig into his background). https://t.co/YtGVENCGCu https://t.co/nzrJ6MZ7e7\\n2. Q appears to want us to push this hash tag: #internetbillofrights. https://t.co/3QiuaWQ2G0\\n7.  Q responds to an anon who had concerns about IBOR. Q clarifies 1st Amendment can\\'t be enforced upon private companies. Yes, they risk losing cash but Clowns make up for it (e.g. OUR TAX PAYER DOLLARS!). There must be a way to prove that if WE are funding, we should control! https://t.co/A0P2C8gWl1\\n4. Just a theory here but IF Snowden has flipped because he is now, according to Q,  a \"liability\" to Clowns (like JP Barlow, who was 187\\'ed, became), is Q Team, w/China\\'s assistance helping him clear customs? Is Snowden evading capture by Clowns? https://t.co/nLDiYEdO7K\\n@threadreaderapp please unroll.\\n8. This anon did a great breakdown of a potential timeline for Q\\'s use of \"BOOM\" in multiple drops. Sounds plausible. We shall see what happens in the news tomorrow if the ref to \"-24\" is some kind of op (Snowden extraction from HK?) and only IF the MSM (maybe only FNC?) reports. https://t.co/L193DepFS0\\nHmmm...Q is on the hunt for @Snowden. This looks like it could be Hong Kong. I lived there from 1976-1980. A lot has changed, no doubt, but it sure looks that way. The guy in the center of the crowd could be him? https://t.co/Wh29gBoHmQ\\n3. Q tells us the #internetbillofrights has nothing to do with AT&amp;T. This scares the Clowns more than anything because they will no longer control the msg. Yes, we have the 1st Amendment &amp; yes, these are private companies BUT they are censoring conservative voices. That\\'s not OK. https://t.co/ZA921vgplV\\n5. It seems pretty clear CLOWNS control social media. Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO) likely wrote the code to censor across platforms. I\\'m guessing Russia, China, &amp; HK probably were sold this code by ES (or via HRC selling access to her unclass server?). https://t.co/rHiuN6p8JZ',\n",

It\\'s not the song, it\\'s the dance. 4/\\nThe best startup pitches identify a big problem, show why your product is the solution, and then prove your potential to be huge with the right team, traction, growth plan, unit economics, and adjacent markets you\\'ll conquer. 2/\\nDon\\'t write off lesser-known investors. A mid-tier fund\\'s YES beats a top dog\\'s No any day. Once you get a term sheet, don\\'t say who it\\'s from but leverage it to get offers or better deals from other investors. Don\\'t be a jerk about it. 7/\\nStartups can die waiting for an investor\\'s due diligence to finish before they get the cash. The median wait after a soft YES is 41 days. Make sure you have enough runway to survive that long. 8/\\nThe best startup tip is still \"don\\'t quit\". When investors says no, employees leave, competitors emerge, and you want to hide: have grit, pivot, survive. Here are some more strategies from Atrium. https://t.co/kMWBaUPUlr What are your best fundraising tricks? 10/10\\nPracticing your startup pitch is critical because it A/B tests narratives, unearths hard questions, and breeds confidence.

They have to take out the #DeepState actors that have influence &amp; can harm Americans before they can begin the mass arrests. Look at the #FloridaShooting - That was a message to POTUS that Deep State still has influence.\\n9) What else can we do? Vote! Vote like your Life and Nation depends on it. Because it does.

I don’t find McCabe leaving earlier than planned as so crazy today. Not panicking. /4\\nWith Fast &amp; Furious, under Holder DOJ, the White House and DOJ and Holder got hit repeatedly by the Hill Republicans, and at some point, someone had to be the fall guy. It was my friend/former colleague Jason Weinstein. Jason was a long-time career prosecutor who “resigned.” /7\\nOf course not. But to me this makes the most sense as to why McCabe is fall guy, &amp; why it happened early and caught FBI and others off guard. The good news: McCabe has much more time for Mueller now. I’m not panicked. I hope you won’t be either. /END\\nI suspect new General Counsel Dana Boente worked on a settlement agreement over weekend to get McCabe to resign in return for McCabe getting to use paid administrative leave + benefits so that he won’t take financial hit. McCabe would have agreed to stop work &amp; depart early. /2\\nPushing out McCabe is like throwing fresh meat to the wolves. It is an easy one to do, McCabe will be fine, and if it will calm the savage beast for a time, it is a no-brainer for Team Trump. Emphasis on McCabe will be fine. I saw similar dynamic w Fast &amp; Furious under Holder. /6\\nThe bottom line is that every thing we know about Trump and his advisors shows us that they are trying to manage him, his rage and reign him in. IMHO, they can assuage his rage &amp; paranoia by saying to McCabe, it’ll be easier on all if you just go early. Is any of this normal? /8\\nAs many know, I have consistently said that Chris Wray wanting a new Deputy is not unusual. At all. It is in the usual course that leadership brings in their own team, and McCabe has helped Wray transition and get his sea legs long enough. /5\\nHere are my (perhaps unconventional) thoughts on the McCabe departure today. I’m not a TV pundit but I did work @ #DOJ for 18 yrs, 15 of which I was employment counsel for DOJ. McCabe is career SES/not political. They couldn’t remove/fire him unless they all reached agreement. /1\\nIt is not unusual to reach this type of agreement with an employee you need to get out of the office. Although usually the employee would be a poor performer and usually you couldn’t pay him for not working for more than 10 days per DOJ policy. Firing McCabe would be illegal. /3',\n",

Fin.\\nSpeaking generally, not about any individual, as as for the defense that \"I just don\\'t believe this person could do that because of X or Y,\" know that anyone is capable of abuse and harassment. It\\'s about power, full stop.\\nAs for firm that did the Seacrest investigation: Their finding was “insufficient evidence” of wrongdoing. Whatever that means. As for corroboration, @gdanielholloway talked to many other sources &amp; another employee told NBC he witnessed alleged abuse https://t.co/XWMNkGqwzs\\nThread.

       " 'La belle histoire d\\'amour d\\'Héloïse et d\\'Abélard cache en réalité une sordide affaire de violence sexuelle et de viol. Comme il y en avait tant à l\\'époque, comme il y en a trop aujourd\\'hui (@titiou). Clairement, Héloïse aurait pu dire #metoo et #BalanceTonPorc ... ! https://t.co/V2R7dyfjw2\\nRevenons à nos moutons (ou à nos loups). Abélard, pour arriver à ses fins, fait en sorte d\\'aller vivre chez elle et de devenir son professeur particulier. C\\'est déjà assez malsain : on sent bien qu\\'Héloïse ne peut pas échapper à ses visées... https://t.co/gVfkhHnjvU\\nOn est en 1113 à Paris. Abélard (34 ans) est un professeur prestigieux, Héloïse (21 ans) une jeune noble très éduquée et très intelligente. Dans la version classique de l\\'histoire, les deux tombent amoureux, deviennent amants en secret, puis sont punis par la famille d\\'Héloïse https://t.co/VyHUCBTnSP\\nAbélard est castré, Héloïse envoyée au couvent, mais les deux s\\'écrivent de brûlantes lettres d\\'amour qui font d\\'eux LE couple médiéval par excellence. Ils sont d\\'ailleurs enterrés ensemble au Père Lachaise... C\\'est mignon hein ❤️ ? Sauf que... https://t.co/tHTlulnGHd\\nÀ l\\'occasion de la #journeedesdroitsdesfemmes (#JourneeDeLaFemme #8mars #WomensDay) on vous propose de revenir sur l\\'histoire d\\'Héloïse et d\\'Abélard, célèbre \"histoire d\\'amour\" médiévale. Accrochez-vous : cette histoire n\\'est pas celle que vous croyez. À dérouler ⬇️ https://t.co/cLBkPRYpIP\\nLa métaphore du loup s\\'inscrit dans une véritable #cultureduviol : l\\'homme est un prédateur sexuel, la femme une proie. Les nouvelles affiches de la #RATP (justement critiquées) contre le #harcelement sexuel ne disent pas autre chose... https://t.co/NvS0hAG6tx\\nDans l\\'esprit d\\'Abélard, ce n\\'est pas un crime : il était poussé par la folie de l\\'amour. Il va même jusqu\\'à se justifier : s\\'il a frappé Héloïse, c\\'est par amour et par tendresse. Voilà voilà. https://t.co/CvtruHXnI4\\nÉvidemment, à l\\'époque, elle ne pouvait pas. Aux historien•ne•s d\\'aujourd\\'hui de rendre justice à ces femmes violées et violentées d\\'hier, dont les souffrances sont masquées sous de belles histoires d\\'amour... Notre article du jour à retrouver : https://t.co/U2D1z5EIN9\\nMais il va même plus loin encore : dans ses lettres, Abélard dit bien qu\\'il a \"frappé et menacé\" Héloïse pour \"arracher son consentement\" alors même qu\\'elle \"résistait et ne voulait pas\". Et qu\\'il l\\'a fait \"plusieurs fois\", à chaque fois qu\\'il avait envie \"d\\'assouvir ses désirs\". https://t.co/z4EHnQy6hV\\nCar si on reprend ces lettres, qu\\'y lit-on vraiment ? D\\'abord, qu\\'il n\\'y a pas de coup de foudre : Abélard, grand séducteur, décide de conquérir Héloïse. Dans ses lettres, il se décrit lui-même comme un « loup affamé convoitant une tendre brebis ». https://t.co/FZKjqbExa1',\n",

       " \"1/ #Bitcoin is in a mania. I admit that. People are accumulating. If bitcoin was a typical investment, it would be setup for a 90% sell-off. But this isn't a typical investment.\\n9/ A $1000 price of #bitcoin with 10M available bitcoins might be overvalued, but a $100k price with 1M available bitcoins might be undervalued. The decimal is arbitrary.\\n\\nThese wild swings in supply vs demand only happen today in bitcoin. Your typical invest advisor has no idea.\\n6/ That's extremely powerful being that there will only ever be 21M bitcoins. Today, at $15k, buying a whole #bitcoin is still in the reach of at least 1 billion people in the west who have access to credit.\\n10/ Lastly, #bitcoin is a new asset class and a new economic multiplier (it'll kickoff a new era of growth). The eventual price is much higher b/c available supply will shrink w/o affecting utility for censorship resistant pymts. In fact, new upgrades promise much more utility.\\n5/ Increases in the price of #bitcoin come from a different pool of demand than method of payment, discussed above. Price increases come from the demand to hold longer term.\\n\\nThese hodlers don't care about the day to day, or year to year volatility, they want to accumulate.\\n2/ It's important to understand that #bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. 0.00000001 btc = 1 Satoshi, the smallest unit (that the base layer will recognize).\\n4/ For those #bitcoin users, it doesn't matter what the price is. The level of payment demand can remain relatively low and constant. The variables that matter are govt prohibitions (which creates more payment demand) and stability of the network (which speaks to confidence).\\n8/ So, traditional investors that look at #bitcoin as a bubble don't understand the value proposition or the current incentive to hold.\\n\\nWe have a situation where most hodlers are accumulating and won't sell at any price, plus constant demand for censorship resistance.\\n3/ It's true, #Bitcoin isn't usable for everyday payments at the base level, no cryptocurrency is, but it is good at making transactions that are censored by credit cards and other payment methods. ie wikileaks donations, dark mrkt prescription drugs, etc.\\n7/ The other variable I mentioned, stability of the network, got a massive boost in 2017, when users fought off corporate and political attacks. As a network, #bitcoin showed reliability and built trust that it won't be altered by insiders or govts.\",\n",
