Kim Jong Un has NO intention of giving up his nukes. What he wants is to be treated as an equal on the world stage.🤨1/ https://t.co/eAN8j8ovI2 
 Although #NorthKorea tried for DECADES to meet w/the US, no POTUS (R or D) agreed.🤔 Why not? B/c a bilateral meeting of both leaders signifies that we are EQUALS, thereby *validating* DPRK’s whole strategy of using nukes to get “respect” globally.🤨 2/ https://t.co/lS3qyQUFXq 
 🇨🇳CHINA🇨🇳 When analyzing #NorthKorea, we must also consider China.🤔 Why? Because ~90% of North Korea’s trade (imports AND exports) is w/China. So if the world wants to do ANYTHING about NoKo, CHINA must be on board. We know this, and so does Kim Jong Un‼️ 3/ 
 So by agreeing to meet DIRECTLY with Kim Jong Un, Trump essentially is fulfilling #NorthKorea’s goal👉🏼using nukes to get credibility on the world stage‼️ And you can bet that #China is in on this.🤨 4/ 
 So why on earth would Trump meet w/#NorthKorea, thereby validating their whole Nukes-For-Respect plan⁉️ Because Trump is DESPERATE and easily manipulated (of course).🙄 5/ 
 Earlier today, Rexxon Tillerson said that we are “a long ways from negotiations” with #NorthKorea.🤨 So clearly, this “offer” should be considered VERY SHADY‼️ 6/ https://t.co/b6QbB3gVqo 
 Although I fully support peaceful approaches to curtailing #NorthKorea’s nuke program, I am HIGHLY dubious of this “offer”: 👉🏼timing vis à vis Trump’s #SteelTariff (impacts #China) 👉🏼Trump’s need to deflect from #TrumpRussia🇷🇺 👉🏼NO ONE on Team Trump saw this coming 7/ 
 Thus, I view this whole #NorthKorea “offer” as a “Wag the Jong.”🤨 👉🏼timely distraction for Trump to DEFLECT #TrumpRussia🇷🇺 👉🏼potential cover for Trump to relent on “being tough” (tariffs) against #China 8/ 
 If Trump does “anything,” it will NOT be good for the US (of course).🙄 He may: 👉🏼inflate #NorthKorea’s standing globally by meeting 👉🏼generate an “excuse” to go easy on #China on trade issues (hint: see the #SteeleDossier) 👉🏼attempt to deflect from #Mueller’s probe 9/ 
 BOTTOM LINE: *Yet another* attempt by Trump to use US foreign policy to help HIMSELF (or his spawn/Kush).🤬 WORST thing is that Trump may lend credibility to Kim Jong Un, which could validate the “nukes = credibility” edict.😐 NOTHING is good here, unfortunately.🤬 /end 
 PS: although #Russia🇷🇺 is a factor when it comes to #NorthKorea, CHINA🇨🇳 is a FAR bigger player👉🏼~90% of DPRK’s trade is w/China.🤨 Hint: #SteeleDossier warned that Russia was merely a smokescreen for #Trump’s dirty dealings in China &amp;amp; elsewhere.😉 cc @911CORLEBRA777</texto><total_retweets type="int">2722</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">5683</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">453</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">8</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Sadness</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Sadness</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
