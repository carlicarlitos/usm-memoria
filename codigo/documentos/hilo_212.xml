To begin, Google has been a client of #PerkinsCoie for quite a long time.. https://t.co/EJuDlvbHPM 
 @Avery1776 @BabeReflex_8 @passion_4truth @Based_Basterd @passionchica @DropTha_Mic25 @RealMattCouch @KKNoMates @BasedMonitored @with_integrity (2) #Google has a very close relationship with Clinton, it goes all the way back to her days as Secretary of State. Not only did they donate heavily to her campaign they also support the Clinton Foundation. In fact the boss even made her campaign plan. https://t.co/rNSjI6NlxE 
 (3) During the campaign Google and Perkins Coie just happened to partner together to release a tool designated to drive voter turnout. “Partnering” seems like a strange term considering they have long worked together. https://t.co/D9b2if1h2S 
 (4) Oh and Google also decided to venture into cyber-security, they invested $100 million into a little company called #Crowdstrike https://t.co/h4A9F1GfkM 
 (5) Then a funny thing happened in April when #DNC noticed the servers had been penetrated they didn’t call the FBI they had an emergency meeting of course and in that meeting was none other than Sussman from #PerkinsCoie and he took control. https://t.co/XrONH6g4bg 
 (6) Four days later, what did Sussman do? He called #Crowdstrike why not enlist the help of a company owned by your longtime client Google. https://t.co/EnNi1Ug75U 
 (7) Guess what else happened in April? #PerkinsCoie lawyer retained #FusionGPS who, as we know provided us with the #TrumpDossier https://t.co/3KM10oVsrV 
 (8) So #PerkinsCoie who Democrats paid just over $26 million to in 2016, just happen to have hired the two most infamous companies that are responsible for #RussiaGate without either of them would there be any “proof” of “Russian interference” https://t.co/YyH5v48Rgy 
 (9) #FunFact Perkins Coie also represents Amazon, Starbucks and Facebook and Obama, who they defended during all pre-election lawsuits about his birth certificate. https://t.co/MlGLTxrWGi 
 (10) Oh and what would any story be without the one and only #Soros apparently #PerkinsCoie works with him day-to-day in fact if you look at addresses to many super PAC’s and organizations you may not see his name but you’ll see the address of Perkins Coie🧠👀 https://t.co/JA2Wjt2S1X 
 (11) For extra credit: Guess what firm went after @RealSheriffJoe ?? If you guessed #PerkinsCoie you win!! 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/yzmHRssLMw 
 (12) You might be wondering how all this money from Democrats makes it to #PerkinsCoie without raising any red flags with the #FEC ?!? Ah well, the commissioner is a former lawyer there as part of their Political Law Group 🔎💩 https://t.co/7EZH35D4CL 
 (13) BOOM there it is, the country everyone keeps leaving out #UKRAINE cc: @DropTha_Mic25 @with_integrity @chiIIum 👇🏻 https://t.co/IZIc8Npv3E 
 (14) Per the guidance of @Imperator_Rex3 the original lump sum of financing to kick off #Crowdstrike came from Warburg Pincus aka Timothy Geithner. https://t.co/Ov6QZIE8AV 
 (15) To Be Continued.. https://t.co/Y6VXElmqZQ 
 (16) Oh really? One down, how many more to go? Adios Hilda campaign planner and head of Alphabet (aka Google) aka owners of #FusionGPS #TheStormIsHere https://t.co/b4j1lonVRc 
 (17) Offshore leaks? Say it isn’t so🧐 https://t.co/kRlLQRYmAq https://t.co/6sy673G8BH 
 (18) UPDATE Just recently @ChuckGrassley sent a letter to Podesta care of Mark Elias at #PerkinsCoie which begs to question has he always represented him? If so it’s Podesta’s lawyer that hired #FusionGPS ⌛️ https://t.co/wbOPTlD0bH 
 (19) UPDATE they also represent Twitter🤣😂 the #DeepState is real, it’s called Perkins Coie. https://t.co/J1ZoaOXqGa</texto><total_retweets type="int">29517</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">32498</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">343</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">13</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Surprise</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Surprise</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">741977462028926976</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">62650</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">6638</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">154696</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">0.9947793186858032</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
