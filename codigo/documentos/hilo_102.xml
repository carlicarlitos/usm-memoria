 🔥Mueller is probing the “influence of foreign money on Trump’s political activities” &amp;amp; is asking witnesses whether Nader ILLEGALLY funneled money from the UAE to the Trump’s political efforts (campaign, SuperPACs, etc). 2/ #Corruption 
 🔥The UAE brokered the #Seychelles meeting btwn Prince &amp;amp; Kirill Dmitriev (head of #Russian🇷🇺state RDIF investment group) to *establish a SECRET backchannel* btwn Trump and Putin‼️ Nader attended (representing the UAE), and now he is SQUEALING🤗 3/ https://t.co/b8P2GQzcgC 
 To be CLEAR: the UAE thought Prince was speaking for Trump &amp;amp; Dmitriev represented Putin, so this was a SECRET backchannel btwn US and #Russia🇷🇺. Nader is close w/several Trump advisers &amp;amp; previously consulted for Prince’s Blackwater👉🏼brokered BACKCHANNEL w/Russia.🤨 4/ 
 🤣OMG🤣 Nader was 1st served w/search warrants &amp;amp; grand jury #subpoena on Jan 17, shortly after landing in DC.🤨 He had intended to travel to Mar-a-Lago to celebrate Trump’s 1st year in office, but FBI had other plans👉🏼GRILLED him for &amp;gt;2 hours &amp;amp; SEIZED his electronics‼️😎 5/ 
 Since then, Mr. Nader has been GRILLED *numerous times* about meetings in NY during the transition, the #Seychelles meeting &amp;amp; meetings in the WH with KUSHNER and BANNON‼️ Now, do you see how hosed Team🇷🇺Traitor is⁉️ 6/ #MuellerTime 
 Just weeks prior to the #Seychelles, Kush &amp;amp; Flynn met w/then-#Russian🇷🇺ambassador Kislyak to arrange a SECRET backchannel to communicate w/Russia during the transition — while evading USIC detection.🤨 7/ #Espionage 
 🔥KUSH🔥 Just a few days after meeting w/Kislyak, KUSH met w/Sergey Gorkov, a #Russian🇷🇺banker close w/Putin,— whose bank was under #sanctions.🤨 Kush said he was trying to establish backchannel to Putin during the transition.🤔 Folks, this sounds like #Espionage‼️ 8/ 
 In the #Seychelles, Prince says he &amp;amp; Dmitriev, “chatted on topics ranging from oil &amp;amp; commodity prices to how much (Russia) wished for resumption of normal trade relations” with the US.🙄 Meaning: they discussed #sanctions‼️ 9/ #Busted #TrumpRussia 
 Shortly after the #Seychelles meet, Dmitriev met w/Mooch (Scaramucci) at the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos.🤨 In an interview w/Russian🇷🇺”news” outlet TASS, Mooch CRITICIZED #sanctions as ineffective &amp;amp; said Trump &amp;amp; Russia could find “common ground” on numerous issues. 10/ 
 Friends, the FACT that Misha🇷🇺Flynn and George Nader (#Seychelles host) are SQUEALING tells you *everything* that you need to know.🤗 Team🇷🇺Traitor is TOAST‼️ /end #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia #LockThemUp</texto><total_retweets type="int">2560</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">5660</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">165</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">11</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
