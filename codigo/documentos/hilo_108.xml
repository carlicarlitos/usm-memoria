 In 1954, a baby girl was born, whom the Stasi File identifies as Angela Merkel, today‚Äôs Chancellor of Germany. Her official birthday is July 17, 1954. However, the Stasi file which is currently in the Soviet KGB archives, records her birth as April 20, 1954. https://t.co/7v8oHlQcKV 
 Hitler‚Äôs father, who took the name Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Solomon Rothschild‚Äôs mistress Anna Maria Schicklgruber. 
 Upon receipt of the Nazi files on artificial insemination, along with Hitler‚Äôs frozen sperm, the Soviet Politicheskoye Buro (Politburo) authorized the experiments to ‚Äòresurrect‚Äô, ‚Äòif possible‚Äô, a child bearing the ‚Äògenetic markers‚Äô of Adolph Hitler. https://t.co/V3R9rZof7P 
 Soon after the birth of Hitler‚Äôs baby girl, an agreement between the Soviets, the Americans and the Vatican was arranged. Hitler‚Äôs baby was placed under the ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô of the Catholic Church through its ‚Äòconnections‚Äô with the GDR Lutheran Church which took custody of the baby. 
 She was given a false date of birth, July 17, and the name Angela Dorothea Kasner, daughter of Horst Kasner, a Lutheran pastor, and his wife, Herlind ‚Äì an English and Latin teacher. https://t.co/97ZZbhDDmP

 The ‚Äúagreement‚Äù of the Western Allied Powers, the Vatican, and the Soviets was that Hitler‚Äôs daughter would be elevated to international power‚Ä¶but her ascendancy to power would not come until ‚Äúthe Vatican also brought to power a German Pope‚Äù. https://t.co/opsBvzETXv 
 After the death of Pope John Paul II, the former German Nazi Joseph Ratzinger was nominated. He took the name of Pope Benedict XVI on April 20, 2005, as Vicar of Rome. Is it a coincidence that this date was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs birthday? https://t.co/ByJDQsnXng 
 In 1977, Angela Dorothea Kasner became Angela Merkel with her marriage to physicist Ulrich Merkel, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1982 üá©üá™She was elected Chancellor of Germany shortly after Pope Ratzinger assumed the Leadership of the Roman Church ... on Hitler‚Äôs birthday https://t.co/n16cYRvFTA 
 If the Soviet record is true, and the evidence is strong, it opens up some amazing possibilities. The undeniable fact is that Angela Merkel came from obscurity to triumviral power as German Chancellor, President of the European Union, and head of the powerful G-8 economic cartel. https://t.co/kqGmztq7Jj 
 Except for the little moustache, Merkel has a striking resemblance to Adolph Hitler. She is also a dead ringer for her mother ‚Äì Gretl Braun Credit to: https://t.co/7eW0ks5bpJ https://t.co/OkmQIMJQgS
