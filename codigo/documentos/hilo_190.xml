 From 2007 to 2011, he served in leadership roles at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), ultimately serving as Chief of Staff to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III 
 When Rajesh De, the chief lawyer for the National Security Agency, needs a special court order so the agency can spy on potential security threats, he turns to John P. Carlin and his team of attorneys in the Justice Department to advocate for the new authority. https://t.co/EssKH49tYv 
 As a result of NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers suspecting [FISA 702 (#17 – email and phone calls)] surveillance activity was being used for reasons he deemed unlawful, in mid 2016 Rogers ordered the NSA compliance officer to run a full audit on 702 NSA compliance. 
 The NSA compliance officer identified several strange 702 “About Queries” that were being conducted. These were violations of the fourth amendment (illegal search and seizure without a warrant), ie. unlawful surveillance and gathering. Rogers was briefed by the compliance officer 
 Here comes #JohnCarlin: The DOJ National Security Division then set Admiral Mike Rogers up to take the fall for their unlawful conduct. John P Carlin preempted Rogers by filing a notification with the FISA Court on 26th September 2016

 DOJ-NSD head John P Carlin was setting up Rogers as the scapegoat while knowing the NSA FISA compliance officer was still reviewing their conduct. Carlin wouldn’t notify the court unless he was trying to cover something. Carlin then announced his resignation. 
 However, before the review was complete the DOJ-NSD had enough information for their unlawful FISA warrant which worked retroactively to make the prior FBI surveillance (began in July ’16 per James Comey) lawful. Mike Rogers stopped the process on October 26th 2016. 
 As a result of his not going along, Rogers became a risk; DNI #James Clapper demanded he be fired. 
 Ten days after the 2016 election, November 17th 2016, Admiral Rogers travels to Trump Tower without telling ODNI James Clapper. Rogers likely informs President-elect Trump of the prior activity by the FBI and DOJ #AdmiralRogers is a #Hero 
 Thank God #AdmiralRogers didn’t tell #Obama https://t.co/riZ1L4n8mx 
 And a lot of people have been paying Donald Trump a visit at Trump Tower in New York City, mostly people being considered for jobs in the new administration. But one meeting stands out. Navy Admiral Mike Rogers sat down with Trump. 
 This is what a hero looks like https://t.co/SiWggjxr8S
