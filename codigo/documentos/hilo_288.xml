 As we looked more closely at the domains assigned to the server that still hosts the malicious code we found on devinnunes[.]net, a pattern emerged. 
 It became clear that all the websites on this computer were associated with the Nebraska company Northstar Campaign Solutions. It also became clear that the malicious code we found was not an accident. 
 When we checked the IP address of the devinnunes[.]net server, we found that it apparently hosts at least one other website. That website is northstarcampaigns[.]com. 
 But like devinnunes[.]net, that website has disappeared. More specifically, we get a &quot;404&quot; error when we try to navigate to it with a web browser. This means that the files that display the website have been removed from the server. 
 This IP address - 40.114.3.8 - belongs to a server provided by Microsoft&apos;s Azure hosting service. According to VirusTotal, there is yet another domain associated with this IP address - https://t.co/f5NDlzGyq9. Drinkstocks? Really? What the hell is going on? https://t.co/RT1dAEAjxe 
 When we browse to drinkstocks[.]com, we are redirected to another URL. An apparent login form for a site called ezpolitix[.]com. https://t.co/T0BkN7P8HZ 
 This is bizarre indeed. Why would a domain called drinkstocks[.]com redirect to the log in page for a political site? We continued our investigation. 
 We next had a closer look at the domain northstarcampaigns[.]com. To our surprise it has been hosted at five different IP addresses in the past two years. 
 That means all these separate IP addresses and the servers associated with them are almost certainly controlled by the same IT team. https://t.co/zGYAy5BuNm 
 Looking at the IP addresses that had hosted this domain, one stood out - the server associated with the address 98.142.91.163. This IP address is associated with the hosting service Cosentry - an entirely different hosting provider from the Microsoft Azure 40.114.3.8 IP address. 
 https://t.co/BcsaJx0IG3 was hosted there previously, as were a number of political-looking domains. What else was hosted there? Well according to VirusTotal, a VERY nasty virus file &quot;calls home&quot; to this server. 
 By this we mean code running on other computers has been programmed to communicate specifically with this server!! Read that over a few times!! This is crazy. https://t.co/NUgRsPSihN 
 Let&apos;s look at the viruses associated with this file. https://t.co/Y88WvxMe14 
 What is this Trojan file, and what is it capable of doing? It is a &quot;trojan threat designed to steal data from victim&apos;s system&quot;. https://t.co/U1fasmprSo 
 This is looking sinister indeed. To summarize, one of the computers that has recently hosted https://t.co/NdBG9rLaVb is serving malicious code disguised to look like a jpg image file. 
 Meanwhile, another computer that has recently hosted https://t.co/NdBG9rLaVb is receiving communications from computers infected with an information-stealing Trojan Horse. 
 Two different computers, two different hosting providers. Both associated with North Star Campaigns. Both also associated with some VERY nasty spyware. 
 This raises a great many questions. What is the company North Star Campaigns? How are they associated with Devin Nunes? How are they associated with EZPolitix? Who is behind all this? 
 We have just begun. This is a crazy and deeply concerning story.
