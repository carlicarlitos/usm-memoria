If bitcoin was a typical investment, it would be setup for a 90% sell-off. But this isn&apos;t a typical investment. 
 2/ It&apos;s important to understand that #bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. 0.00000001 btc = 1 Satoshi, the smallest unit (that the base layer will recognize). 
 3/ It&apos;s true, #Bitcoin isn&apos;t usable for everyday payments at the base level, no cryptocurrency is, but it is good at making transactions that are censored by credit cards and other payment methods. ie wikileaks donations, dark mrkt prescription drugs, etc. 
 4/ For those #bitcoin users, it doesn&apos;t matter what the price is. The level of payment demand can remain relatively low and constant. The variables that matter are govt prohibitions (which creates more payment demand) and stability of the network (which speaks to confidence). 
 5/ Increases in the price of #bitcoin come from a different pool of demand than method of payment, discussed above. Price increases come from the demand to hold longer term. These hodlers don&apos;t care about the day to day, or year to year volatility, they want to accumulate. 
 6/ That&apos;s extremely powerful being that there will only ever be 21M bitcoins. Today, at $15k, buying a whole #bitcoin is still in the reach of at least 1 billion people in the west who have access to credit. 
 7/ The other variable I mentioned, stability of the network, got a massive boost in 2017, when users fought off corporate and political attacks. As a network, #bitcoin showed reliability and built trust that it won&apos;t be altered by insiders or govts. 
 8/ So, traditional investors that look at #bitcoin as a bubble don&apos;t understand the value proposition or the current incentive to hold. We have a situation where most hodlers are accumulating and won&apos;t sell at any price, plus constant demand for censorship resistance. 
 9/ A $1000 price of #bitcoin with 10M available bitcoins might be overvalued, but a $100k price with 1M available bitcoins might be undervalued. The decimal is arbitrary. These wild swings in supply vs demand only happen today in bitcoin. Your typical invest advisor has no idea. 
 10/ Lastly, #bitcoin is a new asset class and a new economic multiplier (it&apos;ll kickoff a new era of growth). The eventual price is much higher b/c available supply will shrink w/o affecting utility for censorship resistant pymts. In fact, new upgrades promise much more utility.</texto><total_retweets type="int">155</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">519</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">19</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">2</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1475038004</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">18298</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">662</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">25112</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.1153767546447413</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
