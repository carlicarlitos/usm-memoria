 2) Even within this tweetstorm are probably a lot of missing nuances. Do tell your stories. I will start after #WWI and the Treaty of Versailles. It never made sense. Why divide #Germany in these pieces and leave it&apos;s people impoverished? Isn&apos;t this a recipe for resentment?

 3) Why did the #Germans, even though a foreign boot never shot a boot on their soil, make overtures of peace to end the #war, while they were poised to win? Their objectives were met. Why was the #USA brought into WWI? Why were large payments sent to #communist #Russia? #QAnon

 4) Why did AHitler repeatedly say #GER was betrayed? Another force was present, one that was not a nation state. Germany had already won WWI w/ technology: rendered #uk helpless in starvation, the #French had already mutinied, the #Russian army defecting, Italian&apos;s collapsed.

 5) But even in this state, #GER was offering #England peace terms. What were they aware of? Was is it that non-nation state that was funding #Napoleonic wars? On both sides of all conflicts for over 2 centuries? That has the resources to bring nation states into a conflict?

 6) Why would defeated nations not accept defeat? Here comes the grand deal of WWI. Palestine. And the &quot;stab in the back&quot;... someone told #England they&apos;d win if they bring #America into the war. But why would the #USA do that? Think #FederalReserve. #QAnon #Palestinian

 7) Who had the resources to make such stunning assurances? #Roths The #USA was brought into WWI to defeat Germany so that the #Rothschilds could create a #Jewish state. The #british promised #palestine, their &quot;territory&quot; in exchange for American help. #Qanon #Geopolitics

 8) The #Brits, desperate to make a deal, would have to pay up after defeating #GER, #HUN, #AUT, #TUR. Oct, 1916. Over 100 years later, the world is dominated by this promise. American&apos;s never fully understood why they went to war with #Germany. Enter the Balfour Declaration.

 9) That&apos;s where 100 years of trouble started. Not making apologies for Germany, rather develop an understanding of what the #cabal is &amp;amp; how it works. By eliminating modern problems, you can see how maneuverings happened &amp;amp; why... this strange past makes u question everything now.

 10) You can turn the clock back to ancient #rome... same garbage, different tools. This story has the most relevance to today, because that same single family pulls the strings on modern society. #GreatAwakening #Q #untoldhistory

 11) If you think for a second this is a &quot;Jewish thing&quot; you have missed the point completely. Anyone who had damaged the intentions of peace of a nations clearly in a dominant position, wanting to stop carnage, would be a target of resentment.

 12) This story ends way short of it&apos;s historical truth, but that is intentional, because it&apos;s really a story about today. #Qanon

 13) The same powers controlling the world during this time are almost the same as today. But in Rome we had the same problems. What does that tell you? It says the ability of the populace to be informed makes it possible. What forces keep us uninformed? #qanon #FakeNewsMedia

 14) And there we go. Those unformed about history are forced to repeat it. Those very powerful hold the levers to keep &quot;history&quot; under lock and key. The internet has finally given us a tool-set to pick that lock.... But a new breed of #facistsis trying to stop us. #Qanon

 15) Draw the inference, #friends. If lack of information allows for horrific historical outcomes, who is preventing us from being informed? #Facebook #Google #Twitter... #MSM.... #CIA What do we do?

 17) This is why you never hear about #china in news. Russia&apos;s a distraction from the new influences in our world, influences that 40 years ago were impoverished, but rose up quickly (like the Nazis) &amp;amp; started to exert immense influence. This is all about #CHN not #RUS #QAnon
