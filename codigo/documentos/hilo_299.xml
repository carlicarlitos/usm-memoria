 @Ronhill1999Hill 2) has not gone anywhere like planned by left. Whether Mulehead was &quot;trying to get Trump&quot; from beginning, about 3 mo ago he knew that was 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 3) null and void. There were NO Trump crimes to investigate. On the other hand, if he was brought in by Trump as I claim, he found himself 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 4) with a much different problem--one I suspect he really didn&apos;t think he&apos;d have: Massive corruption trail from Podestas to Zero. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 5) Then, in the middle of that came U1 &amp;amp; the VERY real possibility that RR could suddenly expand the scope of his charge (which he MAY have 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 6) already done. Contrary to the &quot;fire Sessions&quot; crowd, NO ONE knows exactly what RR tells Mulehead. 6) Either way--expanded case or not-- 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 7) Mulehead has a massive problem he really didn&apos;t expect: ALL shitroads lead to the Podestas &amp;amp; when that road forks into dossier or U1, 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 8) EITHER WAY it goes to Cankles and Zero. Mulehead has no option here. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 9) This is where @Ronhill1999Hill &apos;s question comes in: He asked, &quot;If I was Mulehead, what would I do?&quot; He does NOT want to get in U1. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 10) Whether he is corrupt or a &quot;good cop&quot; whom Trump has leverage on this is a no win. NO I&apos;m not sympathetic to him, just 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 11) as a historian trying to explain what he&apos;s thinking. Either the dossier OR U1 is a scandal so big it could endanger the Republic. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 12) He&apos;s thinking, &quot;My God, I&apos;d have to indict a former SecState, 90% of the DNC, and probably have the former &quot;First Black Prez&quot; as an 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 13) indicted or unindicted co-conspirator-That would bring revolution to the streets/violence. Hell no!&quot; Again this is what hes looking at 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 14) I&apos;m not saying that&apos;s the case, or if it is the case, if it&apos;s not &quot;tough toenails, enforce the law.&quot; I&apos;m trying to have you see it . . 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 15) Through HIS eyes. So, what does he do? He can continue to pull the Manafort Podesta thread. We all know where that goes. NOT TO TRUMP. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 16) The danger to him is that he will get to the point where he cannot stop, where it&apos;s too obvious that the next step is Cankles/Zero 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 17) Meanwhile, every minute he continues to operate, RR may (if he hasn&apos;t) expand his scope for U1 &amp;amp; that DEFINITELY implicates Cankles/Zero 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 18) So that&apos;s all option 1. 19) Option 2 is say, &quot;We&apos;ve found no evidence of Russian collusion in 2016 to make any recs at this time.&quot; 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 20) the Funnel will likely get off on technicalities, likely on a Friday before Thanksgiving, &amp;amp; Mulehead will run away as fast as he can. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 21) Trump will be as &quot;cleared&quot; as Mulehead can make it. Left will go nuts. Right will go nuts. Congress will thump their chests &amp;amp; do nothing 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 22) If Sessions ISN&apos;T ALREADY WORKING THIS in a B-team sting, as I think/hope, then the whole thing would end with a whimper. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 23) I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready to buy Ron&apos;s theory yet: Mulehead may already have so much evidence HE can be charged if he doesn&apos;t move. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 24) And there is the strong possibility a DOJ attachment team is working this. 25) All I&apos;m saying is today Mulehead is looking to get 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 26) as far away from this as he possibly can.</texto><total_retweets type="int">1141</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">3442</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">182</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">0</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Anger</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">562255311</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">55822</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">3731</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">95995</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.0382488560022758</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
