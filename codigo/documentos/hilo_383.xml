 2/ enough indictments. There is more than enough proof that redistricting was with bias and malicious intent. There is and will be more 
 3/ than enough proof of election tampering, hacking, fraud, altering and improprieties. #UnhackTheVote. There is and will be more than 
 4/ enough proof of conspiracy. #LockThemUp There will be more than enough evidence of treason. #RemoveThemFromOffice Yet, we can not wait 
 5/ and should not wait for #MuellerTime, #FBI or #CongressionalActs to save us and our country. There is more than enough to NULLIFY and 
 6/ FORCE A NEW ELECTION NOW to Protect Our Liberties, Democracy and Citizens. #WeThePeople must #DemandANewElectionNOW Forget Hillary, 
 7/ Bernie, Joe or any of the past DNC or GOP Candidates. Their time has past and #ItIsTime for new blood, ideas, energies and younger 
 8/ faces of leaders to lead us to #HealOurNationNow and #BuildUSStronger. This isn&apos;t something that can evolve in time. This isn&apos;t 
 9/ something we can wait for to happen. This isn&apos;t something we eventually want to see become reality. THIS IS AN URGENT NEED... TODAY... 
 10/ RIGHT NOW! Demand it, en masse, relentlessly and as a revolutionary and peaceful coup if need be. To do this we must first acknowledge 
 11/ that Indivisible must be inclusive and partisan BY CHOICE to #BuildTheBlueWall and #TheNewBlue for Democracy. 
 12/ #IndivisibleCanNOTBeDivisable. However, I&apos;ve seen Indivisible being more divisive than uniting over time. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I still 
 13/ support Indivisible&apos;s resistance efforts against the trump agenda and regime. However, I can no longer support Indivisible&apos;s stance to 
 14/ remain nonpartisan versus only being inclusive and CHOOSING the party that will successfully #FlipStates, #FlipCounties, and 
 15/ #FlipCounties. #FlipItBlue MUST be a partisan choice, and when we are united that means #AllOfUs working together building #ANewBlue 
 16/ together from the glorious and powerful various shades of red, purple and even green that we are. #NeverForget #WeAreTheMajority 
 17/ #WeAreThePopularVote This isn&apos;t a time for segregation of liberals, progressives, democrats, left-leaning conservatives, greens or 3rd 
 18/ parties, etc. We can&apos;t afford the luxury of separation based on our individual beliefs or views. We HAVE a common ground we share. We 
 19/ must stand on that common ground together and united to #ResistForGOOD so we can #PersistAndInsist on demands to #SaveOurNation. 
 20/ #WeMustMakeThisHappen #WeMustDoItNOW #WeMustRiseToUprise #Remove #Impeach #Indict #Eliminate #Nullify #Void the 2016 election, as well 
 21/ as all appointments, executive orders and legislation since 01/20/2017. #WeAreTheMajority #ThisIsADemocracy #WeWillPrevail 
 22/ #GoodWillCrushEvil #RTYourAgreement #ImpeachmentOfOneIsNOTEnough #OrganizeAndActNOW Unite to stand and act shoulder to shoulder, 
 23/ heart to heart and will to will with your family, friends and neighbors. #PeopleUnitedWillWin. What can we do NOW? What can you do 
 24/ NOW? We need revolutionary organizers and action on a fast track to get results NOW. Tweet your ideas, plans, calls to action and 
 25/ anything that could be done for maximum effect with results to this thread. Share the energy and enthusiasm to battle the evil that 
 26/ divides, harms, maligns, oppressed and sabbotages us. Y&apos;all have to be as fed up as I am and know that enough is enough. We must be 
 27/ fed up to the point where we make something HUGE happen to break the grip of evil on our nation... and that something must happen 
 28/ sooner rather than later. Let&apos;s break new ground with new ideas that can be that something we can do NOW. North Koreans ousted, en 
 29/ masse, their President in March 2017. If North Koreans can do it, so can we! I can&apos;t be the only one feeling this way or sense of 
 30/ urgency, right? I&apos;m not alone in my view something that hasn&apos;t been done yet needs to be identified and done, am I? &amp;gt; #EndRant</texto><total_retweets type="int">3</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">101</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">31</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">43</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">25097371</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">8777</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">9532</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">114891</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">0.7919690190697756</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
