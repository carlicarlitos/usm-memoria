Some ask for #donations to help impeach Trump. Some sell shirts, phone cases, etc. And there are others that ask for money for various causes. THREAD 1 #scam #donate #con #PSA https://t.co/hkkaTgNHSP 
 I‚Äôve written about some before, I have a collection of threads about them here. 2 https://t.co/rzMhBTYpwi #fraud #con #ripoff #cheat 
 You can verify a charity‚Äôs non-profit status before donating. Donations to non-profits are always TAX DEDUCTIBLE, so get a receipt! 3 https://t.co/hkPIPlYaLk https://t.co/UGFFWyABYI 
 If a fundraiser isn‚Äôt a non-profit, ask some questions. First ‚Äì what are they raising money for? Are there non-profits for the same cause? If so, donate to the non-profit. They are held accountable for how their $ is spent. 5 #protip https://t.co/tab6kFhyyY https://t.co/hJWxjNN8aq 
 #FundraisingFraud is not uncommon, according to the Better Business Bureau. Online communities like #TheResistance are especially vulnerable to this since we feel like we know people we haven‚Äôt met. 6 #fraud #onlinescam https://t.co/T3vktpf0QV https://t.co/whGhRZyMWt 
 Crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe, YouCaring, Kickstarter, etc. do almost no screening for their fundraising campaigns. Many are for people who need financial help due to hardship or illness. It‚Äôs hard to verify if you don‚Äôt know the person. 7 https://t.co/tJ4ha2F4Pe https://t.co/hcqQYFpdI6 
 This scam has fooled many in #TheResistance. It‚Äôs tough - nobody wants to think that someone would lie about having a serious illness. @RachelAzzara 8 #hepzi #grifter #catfish #FridayFeeling https://t.co/AycQVmPfjU 
 THE most important questions to ask are about #money ‚Äì what is the money for? How will it be spent? How can people who donate see where the money has gone and get updates? Who is responsible for handling the money? 9 #accountability #transparency #finances https://t.co/RzF2fMurek 
 If it‚Äôs someone selling merchandise that says a portion of the proceeds will go to charity, a non-profit or resistance related causes, ask for details ‚Äì when? How? Which causes? By check? How frequently? How will customers know? 10 #smartquestions #question #proof #receipts https://t.co/gTUlWvfvcL 
 A legitimate business who isn‚Äôt hiding anything will be ready, able and willing to answer these questions. If they get defensive, don‚Äôt answer or avoid the question, that‚Äôs a HUGE red flag! DON‚ÄôT buy from them! 11 https://t.co/luehDFu4wt 
 There are even people who ask for donations to ‚Äústart up‚Äù non-profits. Evaluate which services the non-profit will provide ‚Äì do others already fill that need? How much is the person asking for? What does it actually cost to apply for non-profit status? 12 #fishy #suspicious https://t.co/MoUcgN832R 
 For example, here is pricing for LegalZoom‚Äôs non-profit creation service packages, which range from $99 to $359. The most expensive one comes to $519, including NC filing fees. 13 https://t.co/xS8dBtSYkv #NCResists https://t.co/igkqcvNvHF 
 Here‚Äôs another quote for starting a non-profit in North Carolina. Bizfilings is a reputable company, the non-profit 501c3 I volunteer for uses them to file our tax statement. Their most expensive option comes to $511. 14 #factsmatter https://t.co/LHd7U8lA8S https://t.co/GkI1WEHRdq 
 It took 10 minutes of Googling to get an idea of what it costs to file for non-profit status in a random state. So if you see someone asking for several thousand dollars to start a non-profit, ask why they need so much and exactly what costs they have. 15 #research https://t.co/ZSotOMfHWx 
 An attorney friend got some quotes for me, and even if you had an attorney handle filing for non-profit status, it would still be below, say, $5,000. So do your research. Ask specific questions and insist on thorough answers. 16 #allaboutthemoney 
 Anyone asking for money to start a non-profit or for a ‚Äúgood cause‚Äù that isn‚Äôt a non-profit needs to be completely transparent about expenses. Non-profits already meet that standard, so individuals should too. Trust is earned with 17 #transparency. https://t.co/qS9gMSSk9d 
 To act in good faith, one should file for non-profit status FIRST. Once they have their non profit status and an EIN # from the IRS, then they can ask for donations as a non-profit organization. Especially since it‚Äôs not that expensive to file for non-profit status. 18 https://t.co/H6cPXFcX17 
 Non-profits are held accountable by law. Fundraising that isn‚Äôt for non-profits isn‚Äôt bound by those laws, so the people fundraising can do whatever they want with that money. Even disappear with it. 19 https://t.co/esHRo085kG 
 On GoFundMe specifically, if the person the money is going to isn‚Äôt Facebook Verified, don‚Äôt donate to them. Google their name and state to see if they are even a real person, or using a real name. GoFundMe doesn‚Äôt require that. 20 https://t.co/CuuFFQxHVu 
 I wrote this because I‚Äôve seen a lot of questionable accounts trying to profit from #TheResistance and I think that‚Äôs wrong. Resistors are hard working people and I don‚Äôt want anyone getting conned out of their money. 21 #TheMoreYouKnow https://t.co/Q309mkTcCB
