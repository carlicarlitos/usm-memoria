 Vote Leave was the *official* #Brexit campaign, run by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.🤔 Right before the election, Vote Leave donated a total of £675,315 in 4 donations over 8 days to BeLeave, a political org set up by two 21-something yo’s who worked for Vote Leave.🤨 2/ https://t.co/KZJG3ODsx7 
 Quick digression on UK campaign finance law before adding to the story.🤓 The SPENDING limit for Vote Leave (official campaign group) was £7m. Separate campaigns (such as BeLeave) could spend up to £700,000 each, but CANNOT coordinate or “work together”.🤨 3/ 
 Back to Cambridge Analytica (CA), yet again a central player in a SHADY political plot.🙄 Chris Wylie from SCL/CA co-founded AggregateIQ (#AIQ), a tiny Canadian company that built CA’s technology platform &amp;amp; managed their databases🤔 4/ 
 CA *owns* all of #AIQ “intellectual property,” which in the tech biz, basically means that CA = AIQ. (This is important later, when we loop this back into UK election laws.😉) 5/ 
 Wylie says that #AIQ *connected CA’s algorithms to social &amp;amp; online advertising networks*.🤬 In 2015-16, almost all of AIQ’s work came via CA (who OWNS them)👉🏼worked closely w/Steve Bannon on multiple US campaigns. “Bannon was always interested in #Brexit,” says Wylie.🤨 6/ https://t.co/qBUBZpGuqf 
 During #Brexit, AIQ received a total of £3.9m of campaign funds from 4 pro-leave groups, even though these groups were *supposedly separate* and could only “work together” if they shared the total spending limit of of £7m.🤔 7/

 AIQ connected CA’s algorithm to social media/online ads👉🏼central role in the data-driven microtargeting of “persuadables” in the final days of the #Brexit campaign.🤔 9/ https://t.co/MjnRA6hiB3 
 Weirdly, these *supposedly separate* 4 pro-#Brexit groups mysteriously &amp;amp; “independently” used #AIQ, the SAME tiny data analytics firm, located on an island in west Canada.🙄 AIQ handled the MICROTARGETING for *all 4* firms👉🏼*illegal* COORDINATION.🤨10/ https://t.co/h8E8mYIBao 
 It’s *very* difficult to imagine how these 4 pro-#Brexit campaigns are separate, if #AIQ worked for ALL of them.🙄 Vote Leave’ *had hit* its £7m spending limit👉🏼set up BeLeave to funnel £1m donated LATE in the campaign to Vote Leave👉🏼paid AIQ.🤨 11/ https://t.co/mI26KalixA 
 SUMMARY: 3 “unofficial” pro-#Brexit groups used the same #AIQ (owned by CA), as did the “official” Vote Leave campaign group👉🏼MAXED out its legally allowed £7m spend.🤨 NO additional spending allowed, if unofficial groups coordinated‼️ 12/ #Busted https://t.co/aBFNLynPqV 
 Vote Leave and BeLeave (founded by Vote Leave workers &amp;amp; bankrolled by Vote Leave) both claim that they found #AIQ “on the internet.” But online archives show that AIQ’s website didn’t show up in Google searches until *AFTER* the #Brexit referendum‼️ #Coordination #Busted 13/ https://t.co/YqHXCQ9PhQ 
 The difference in the final #Brexit vote tally was only 600,000 people (just over 1% of total votes).🤨 Vote Leave‘s website praised #AIQ pivotal role in #Brexit: “We couldn’t have done it without them.”👈🏼Vote Leave removed this comment from its site this week.🙄 #Busted 14/ https://t.co/t2giQfu61p 
 In the final weeks of the #Brexit campaign Vote Leave ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as “persuadable” w/every kind of online ad. And #AIQ helped w/microtargeting for Vote Leave and the 3 *supposedly separate* pro-leave groups.🙄15/ 
 Last night, UK authorities raided Cambridge Analytica’s London office and search for SEVEN hours.🤗 The search warrant covered *database and servers*‼️😎 16/ https://t.co/rYdGB9SEzP 
 Looks like it’s Cambridge Analytica’s time in the barrel for their work in BOTH the #Brexit and Trump campaigns‼️ Notably, Putin’s #Russia🇷🇺favored these campaigns. And Cambridge Analytica has major links w/Russia.🙄 NOT COINCIDENCE‼️ /end https://t.co/aa1TFYdpYa</texto><total_retweets type="int">3467</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">5299</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">151</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">5</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Sadness</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
