Here‚Äôs what reporters @willCIR and @alyssajperry dug up: https://t.co/sojyThHgjJ 
 2/ Tesla, led by Elon Musk, is worth about $50 billion. It employs around 10,000 workers in Fremont, California. https://t.co/3B312O4Mii 
 3/ Under fire for mounting injuries, Tesla recently touted a sharp drop in its injury rate for 2017, which it says came down to meet the auto industry average of about 6.2 injuries per 100 workers. https://t.co/pHnwSDfQ1W 
 4/ But as @willCIR and @KQED‚Äôs @alyssajperry found, things are not always as they seem at Tesla. In fact, their reporting shows that Tesla has failed to properly count worker injuries, which makes their stats look better than they actually are. 
 5/ Here‚Äôs how it works: Employers are required by law to log workplace injuries that result in job restrictions, time off or medical treatment. Logging is not required if the employee‚Äôs injury is classified as a personal medical issue or a minor incident requiring only first aid. 
 6/ Which leads to cases such as Tarik Logan‚Äôs ... https://t.co/qLv8cuP6Ht 
 7/ How could this happen? Former Tesla safety personnel say there‚Äôs a fundamental problem there. https://t.co/5CTo8Zecbu 
 8/ Another part of the company‚Äôs culture that frustrated White? CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs purported distaste for the color yellow. https://t.co/m9vkB79WU6 
 9/ Other safety-related things Elon Musk reportedly didn‚Äôt like, either: *Too many signs on the factory floor. *The beeping sounds forklifts make when they back up. 10/ Few dared confront Musk about these issues, though. Why? They were afraid to. https://t.co/QyYONY07Y0 
 11/ We brought all this stuff to Tesla for comment. In response, Chief People Officer Gaby Toledano questioned the motives of our sources. 
 12/ Tesla said it records injuries accurately. They also point to an internal survey that they say found 82% of employees believe the company is committed to their health, safety and wellbeing. 
 12/ Right before this story was published, Tesla issued a fiery statement that accused us of being an ‚Äúextremist organization.‚Äù üëáüëá https://t.co/bGfZNNIPmC 
 13/ SICK BURN, TESLA!!! But quick question ... How many extremist orgs are this well-decorated for their independent, nonprofit journalism? https://t.co/jApMuLRTTr 
 14/ Whoops! Left a few out. They didn‚Äôt all fit in that first tweet. https://t.co/nyi0MqS8E5
