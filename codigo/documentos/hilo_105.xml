 And GUESS WHO gave Mueller&apos;s grand jury the evidence⁉️ George Nader, who helped arrange the meeting and also ATTENDED. Nader is now COOPERATING w/Mueller and testified before the grand jury.😎 2/ https://t.co/bRMQudJLsx 
 Nader told investigators the #Seychelles meeting was set up IN ADVANCE so that a &quot;representative of the Trump transition&quot; could meet w/a #Russian🇷🇺emissary to discuss &quot;future relations&quot; btwn the countries.🤨 3/ 
 Of course, Erik Prince LIED to the House Intel Cmte, when he testified that the #Seychelles meeting was a &quot;chance encounter&quot; and was not a planned discussion of US-#Russia🇷🇺 relations.🙄 4/ 
 Prince told House Intel: “...one of the entourage says, ‘Hey, by the way, there’s this Russian guy that we’ve dealt with in the past. He’s here also to see someone from the Emirati delegation. And you should meet him, he’d be an interesting guy for you to know...&quot;🤨 5/ https://t.co/Qd5EdOr7Dk 
 Prince claims he travelled ALL THE WAY to the #Seychelles for a one-hour meeting w/the Emirates, then &quot;just happened&quot; to have an &quot;unexpected&quot; meeting w/Dmitriev, who runs the #Russian-state investment fund⁉️ Yeah, right.🙄 6/ https://t.co/1BMrKDGHkk 
 Prince implausibly testified that the Emiratis somehow &quot;just happened&quot; to know that Dmitriev would &quot;just happen&quot; to be chilling in the bar after dinner.🙄 7/ https://t.co/uwKODLPyPK 
 Prince also implausibly claimed that he recognized Dmitriev by Googling him (i.e., no introduction was made), and that he didn&apos;t know that the Russian-state investment fund (RDIF) was under #sanctions.🤨 8/ https://t.co/wwxy7Gw8v5 
 Prince said he &amp;amp; Dmitriev &quot;chatted on topics ranging from oil and commodity prices to how much his country wished for resumption of normal trade relations w/the USA.” DING. DING. DING.🛎️ Although Prince denied it, they discussed #sanctions = &quot;normal trade relations&quot;‼️ 9/ https://t.co/Li5VVZMgTk 
 🔥LIAR🔥 We *know* that Prince did NOT &quot;just happen&quot; to meet w/the Kremlin&apos;s representative in the #Seychelles, and he didn&apos;t just run into him at the bar, and they DID discuss #sanctions. George Nader was THERE, and he&apos;s telling ALL to Mueller.😎 10/ 
 Event better, although Nader’s witness account is considered key evidence — it is NOT the only evidence — about what transpired in the #Seychelles.😎 Lordy, there are TAPES‼️ 11/ #SIGINT https://t.co/oHekzUqB4a 
 Although Prince had no &quot;formal&quot; role w/the Trump campaign or transition, according to people familiar with the #Seychelles meeting, Prince presented himself as an unofficial ENVOY for Trump to the high-ranking Emiratis who arranged his meeting w/the #Russian🇷🇺. 12/ #Busted 
 Today&apos;s report offers *yet more* evidence of the MASSIVE #conspiracy between #Russia🇷🇺 and Trump for help in throwing the election in return for dropping #sanctions.
