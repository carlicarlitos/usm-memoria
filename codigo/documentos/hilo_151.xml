But while the FBI publicly revealed the investigation of HRC--more than once-- they never revealed investigation of Trump. 1/ 
 If the FBI wanted to go after Trump, as is alleged in this ludicrous #NunesMemo, all that was needed was to reveal the investigation. But instead they kept it super, ultra secret--even to the press, as was made clear with this embarrassing header. https://t.co/WBrdpb5vLs 2/ 
 It took a year and a half for the story to actually break of what happened--&quot;coffee boy&quot; #GeorgePapadopoulos exposed the connections. The #SteeleDossier was never more than a side-trip on the road to indictments. Pretending otherwise just isn&apos;t smart. https://t.co/4LlcEHfaV8 3/ 
 We&apos;re all worn down by the #MuellerInvestigation. It&apos;s a blight on this country that a sitting president is illegitimately in that office. But the #NunesMemo does nothing to move us forward. There&apos;s nothing we don&apos;t already know. I really expected something dramatic. #MemoDay 4/ 
 After Wray and Rosenstein requested that the #NunesMemo not be revealed, I thought there really was a threat. But it&apos;s obviously more that the FBI wanted to limit more conspiracy theorizing and interference in the investigation by Trump. #MemoDay https://t.co/WkIKy3qzDk … … 5/ 
 We are still in the same quagmire. #NunesMemo confirms FBI used evidence from their investigation into #Papadopoulos to expand the #FISA warrant on #CarterPage. This confirms the validity of the FBI investigation &amp;amp; situates it firmly within the #FISA guidelines. #MemoDay 6/ 
 If Trump knew anything about how the US govt &amp;amp; his own DOJ worked,he&apos;d know no #FISA warrant could ever be issued based hearsay. It was #GeorgePapadopoulos who led to the warrant, not the #SteeleDossier. (Yet it&apos;s vital to recall that the dossier was never debunked.) #MemoDay 7/ 
 And so here we are, back where we began, with Trump &amp;amp; #GOP trying to blame Hillary Clinton for their actions. They and @FoxNews (and many now-disgraced white male pundits on both sides) are still fixated on her, but she&apos;s not the problem: Trump is America&apos;s problem. #MemoDay 8/ 
 My concern, now, is about 2020 and the threat to that election. I wrote about it to some degree in today&apos;s column, but it was written prior to the memo drop, so doesn&apos;t include it. But it does emphasize where the nation really is despite that fantasy #SOTU speech. #MemoDay 9/ 
 Folks on both sides are desperate to see someone arrested and perp walked. The right wants Hillary, the left wants Trump. Hillary hasn&apos;t committed any crimes and Trump may not have, either. Regardless, it&apos;s mere months till primaries for mid-terms. #MemoDay won&apos;t stop that. 10/ 
 The temptation to believe America can be saved by something other than voting is great but as with all temptation, to be avoided. If you want the #GOP out, vote the mid-terms &amp;amp; don&apos;t screw up like 2010, 2014 and 2016. Put purity aside and #FlipTheHouse. We must rout the GOP. 11/ 
 2020 is more concerning because what we DO know from the #NunesMemo is just how far Trump and the #GOP are willing to go. And they have their full complement of disinformation services right here on Twitter, with help from Wikileaks and FaceBook. #MemoDay 12/ 
 We also know that #GOP #VoterSuppression is a concomitant threat and impacted the votes in PA, MI and WI. So it&apos;s not just the #MemoDay reveals of GOP collusion--it&apos;s the GOP itself. https://t.co/h80AuM42mN 13/ 
 It&apos;s very easy to lose focus witheach new shiny object. That&apos;s all #NunesMemo is. Remember only one president has ever been removed from office. Voting is the way out. Starting now. https://t.co/TXN8JAJQRN 14/</texto><total_retweets type="int">475</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">999</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">52</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">13</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Sadness</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Sadness</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">138168339</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">82272</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">3080</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">342563</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.0950311725658972</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
