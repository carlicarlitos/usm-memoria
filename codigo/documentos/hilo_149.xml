 Note that Mueller didn&apos;t ASK Trump for the documents, but instead DEMANDED them via a #subpoena‼️ Mueller slapped Trump w/the subpoena in recent weeks👉🏼ordered Trump Org to hand over ALL documents related to #Russia🇷🇺 and &quot;other topics&quot; he is investigating.😎 2/ 
 This #subpoena likely is how Mueller obtained Trump&apos;s *personally written note* to Putin in 2013, that was scanned and emailed as a PDF.😂 3/ https://t.co/ncja6fmpZ3 
 As for &quot;other topics&quot; in the #subpoena, Mueller is probing how foreign money may have funded Trump’s political activities &amp;amp; Team🇺🇸Mueller has questioned witnesses, including NADER (adviser to the UAE), about the flow of UAE&apos;s money into the US.😎 4/ https://t.co/XZfM7SsD3y 
 Looks like Mueller crossed Trump&apos;s BOGUS &quot;red line&quot; by inquiring about the #TrumpCrimeFamily business, including asking witnesses about Trump Tower Moscow.😂 5/ 
 We *know* that Felix SATER emailed Michael Cohen *at his Trump Org email account* bragging of his ties w/Putin and claimed that Trump Tower Moscow would help Trump’s presidential campaign.🤔 Sater has been an FBI informant for DECADES‼️😎 6/ https://t.co/LhqmJB9nTG 
 Last summer, Sater told friends and family that he and Trump would be *GOING TO PRISON*‼️ And Sater is cooperating, so just imagine how BIGLY BAD this is for @realDonaldTrump‼️🤣 7/ #MuellerTime https://t.co/aJwJXNk3JR 
 Trump’s lawyers are negotiating about Mueller&apos;s interview of Trump &amp;amp; Mueller has shared topics he wants to discuss.🤗 His lawyers have advised Trump to REFUSE the interview, but Trump wants to do it b/c he says he&apos;s done nothing wrong &amp;amp; can easily answer Mueller&apos;s questions.😂8/ 
 And NO SURPRISE, Trump is considering whether to hire on a new lawyer (Emmet Flood), who is an EXPERT in #impeachment‼️ This sure is a helluva NothingBurger.🍔🍔🍔 9/ #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia https://t.co/PeGSKuWe7p 
 The VAST amount of documents ORDERED by Mueller&apos;s #subpoena likely includes legal agreements / documents relating FOREIGN DEALINGS, including those in #Russia🇷🇺. 10/ 
 No matter exactly what the #subpoena ordered, it is CLEAR that @realDonaldTrump *HIMSELF* and the #TrumpCrimeFamily are directly under investigation by Mueller‼️ 11/ #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia 
 In addition, Mueller&apos;s #subpoena now makes it a CRIME if Trump or his spawn or minions try to destroy evidence‼️😎 12/ #MuellerTime #Busted https://t.co/XZfM7SsD3y 
 Have ZERO doubt, friends. #MuellerIsComing.😎 Trump and the rest of Team🇷🇺Traitor are TOAST‼️ /end #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/GQsr1LWMyS</texto><total_retweets type="int">1974</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">5092</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">208</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">9</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
