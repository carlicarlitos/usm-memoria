 2. #FISAMemo Key points: - Fake Russian Steele dossier was used for FISA warrant, w/o disclosing #HRC/#Dem provenance. - #FBI also PAID for dossier. 
 3. FISAMemo - Another &quot;source&quot; extensively cited in the #FISA warrant application was a Sept 2016 #Yahoo article...which itself cycled back to the fake dossier as its source! That is, this means the FAKE #RussianDossier was essentially the sole source for the #FISA warrant. 
 4. #FISAMemo - #DOJ/#FBI were aware of Steele&apos;s animus toward #Trump (&quot;desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president&quot;) yet did not disclose this bias to the #FISA court. They actively HID this material fact re: prejudice of source. 
 5. #FISAMemo - ADAG #BruceOhr had met privately w/#Steele &amp;amp; his wife #NellieOhr WORKED on dossier. None of this was disclosed to #FISA court. - #BillPreistap indicated Steele dossier was essentially not corroborated by #FBI. In fact, #Comey termed it &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; 
 6. #FISAMemo - #McCabe testified before House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that &quot;no surveillance warrant would have been sought&quot; w/o Steele dossier information...yet this discredited dossier was key justification for the #FISA warrant, which continued to be renewed. 
 7. #FISAMemo - #Memo shows that #DOJ severed relationship w/#Steele as a source due to serious violations in media disclosures, making him a less than reliable source. Despite this, #DOJ/#FBI continued to rely on his salacious piece of fiction to justify espionage on #TrumpTeam. 
 8. #FISAMemo - Final part of #Memo highlights extreme bias AGAINST #Trump shown by #LisaPage &amp;amp; #PeterStrzok, who had cleared #HRC of any crimes &amp;amp; who led investigation against #Trump. This included meeting w/#AndyMcCabe to discuss an &quot;insurance policy&quot; against Trump&apos;s election. 
 9. #FISAMemo Key players implicated in this sordid abuse of #FISA courts to conduct surveillance against #TrumpTeam/#POTUS: #LorettaLynch (DOJ) #SallyYates (DOJ) #DanaBuente (DOJ) #RodRosenstein (DOJ) #BruceOhr (DOJ) #JamesComey (FBI) #AndrewMcCabe (FBI) #BillPriestap (FBI) 
 10. #FISAMemo Key players (cont.) #LisaPage (FBI) Linked to #Dossier: #NellieOhr (#DeepState operative; author) #PerkinsCoie (law firm) #FusionGPS (smear firm) #GlennSimpson (head of Fusion) #ChristopherSteele (&quot;author&quot;) #DNC (funder/disseminator) #HRC (funder/disseminator) 
 11. #FISAMemo #DrainTheSwamp #DeepState #Treason/#Coup goes MUCH deeper than #Memo reveals. #FISA warrants were sought as cover for #Spying that was already being done. To understand BIG PICTURE of WHY the #Cabal needed to stop #Trump, look here: END. https://t.co/aABtDJViAD</texto><total_retweets type="int">19</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">72</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">11</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">40</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">749684424</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">3785</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">3969</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">6802</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">0.7780699304231409</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
