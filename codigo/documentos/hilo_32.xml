 Just found this #GITMO related bid tender document from last year out of Florida. Looks to me like those 13k sealed indictments match up with the 13k new bunks. @Potus aint playin .... #LockThemAllUp #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/gconbanemh‚Ä¶ https://t.co/MBQuNTmW75 
 A BIG part of the end game is THIS‚¨áÔ∏è Save the children Catch pedophiles (many in Hollywood, business leaders) End satanic rituals where young children are sacrificed. #MemoDay #LawAndOrder Pray, pray, pray. God is at work here. https://t.co/ZKYwgaToSt 
 Dear @SecretService US Justice system just collapsed. #Memo exposed offenses against the US and felonies. It is your duty under 18 US Code ¬ß 305 to make arrests without warrants and secure evidence. #CorruptDOJ and #CorruptFBI will not investigate or arrest itself @SecNielsen https://t.co/MpiMWl9faW 
 For those of you who don‚Äôt know the law, Trump and his team (esp Sessions who has taken down many cabals in his years) have been hard at work. AND they‚Äôre going by the book. Patience. https://t.co/Q4xMqkbO1o 
 Public needs to be brought along at every step of the way. Hence one memo released at a time. For the #LawAndOrder party this is incredible. https://t.co/bd3i8iEBwl</texto><total_retweets type="int">701</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">1017</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">82</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">23</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">703990775223169025</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">49465</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">2271</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">73724</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.0775635433488457</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
