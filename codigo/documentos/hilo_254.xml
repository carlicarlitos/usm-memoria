 /2/ From the Executive Summary -- &quot;The threat is a constitutional convention, convened on the petitions of at least 34 state legislatures as specified under an Article V of the Constitution and empowered to rewrite or propose new amendments to that document.&quot; 
 /3/ &quot;Its advocates span the ideological spectrum, including right-of-center supporters of new limits on federal power, from a constitutional requirement that the federal budget be balanced&quot; 
 /4/ &quot;to backers on the left of a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Citizens United, a ruling that reversed decades of well-settled law limiting corporate political spending.&quot; 
 /5/ &quot;We oppose a constitutional convention because we believe there is too much legal ambiguity that leads to too great a risk that it could be hijacked by wealthy special interests pushing a radical agenda that poses a very real threat to American democracy.&quot; 
 /6/ &quot;A convention of states drafted our Constitution [from The Articles Of Confederation] in 1787, including Article V as one of several mechanisms for future amendments.&quot; 
 /7/ &quot;Article V itself has never been used but would be triggered once 34 state legislatures submit applications for a new constitutional convention&quot; 
 /8/ &quot;it then requires Congress to convene a new convention to draft and submit new constitutional amendments to the states for ratification.&quot; 
 /9/ ðŸš¨ There are no settled rules or procedures to govern an Article V convention and it cannot be limited in scope.&quot; 
 /10/ &quot;Though some [concon] proponents say they intend to pass a single amendment â€“ to balance the federal budget&quot; 
 /11/ ðŸš¨ &quot;[...] there is nothing to prevent the convention, once convened, from proposing additional changes that could limit or eliminate fundamental rights or upend our entire system of government.&quot; 
 /12/ &quot;Itâ€™s also unclear how delegates would be chosen. If the selections were made by todayâ€™s largely gerrymandered state legislatures, the convention would likely have a decidedly Republican bent&quot; 
 /13/ &quot;Thanks to the financial and organizational muscle, including millions of dollars in undisclosed, tax-deductible contributions, of the corporate-dominated American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)&quot; 
 /14/ &quot;[...] what once seemed impossible is now within reach. And with it comes a great threat to our democracy.&quot; 
 /15/ &quot;ALEC, a corporate lobby disguised as a charity, and the conservative activists aligned with it, are pursuing three paths toward an amendment.&quot; - Balanced Federal Budget - Compact For America Initiative - Convention Of States For more info refer to the original document. 
 /16/ Key phrases to watch for are &quot;Balanced Budget&quot; and &quot;Independence from Federal Govt&quot;. These are nothing more than deceptive conservative words to make the initiation process sound inviting. They&apos;re often defended with the good old, &quot;but we&apos;ll stop there, of course!&quot; 
 /17/ In truth, republicans, under the paid direction of the #Kochs and other big money and special interests would rewrite the constitution to serve them - and screw the rest of us.
