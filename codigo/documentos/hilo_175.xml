Ahow-to for keeping your info safe. I did all the hard work for ya 😉 
 (for mobile:) - press bottom, right hand button, as if you wanted to go to your own page - scroll all the way down - click “privacy shortcuts” - scroll all the way down - click “more settings” - scroll all the way down You’ll see both apps and ads. We’re gonna do both. 
 APPS: There are three settings on this page: platform, apps others use, and old versions of fb. Platform will tell you all of the apps currently using your information. Don’t get scared! We simply turn it off. - click platform - click edit - click disable platform 
 It does not matter how many apps you had running with your info. Once platform is disabled, they are all disabled. Like putting a kink in a hose. Moving on! 
 - go back to the previous page with all 3 options - click “apps others use” This gives you a list of YOUR information that is available to the app that OTHERS are using. Yes, you read that right. - uncheck anything checked on this list 
 - go back to previous page - click “old versions of fb for mobile” Now this one is tricky. If, for example, you have a privacy setting to only friends seeing your posts...that will work, until you start posting with an outdated version of Facebook. 
 Facebook updates every two weeks like clockwork. Meaning you’re most likely running an old version. If you are, the privacy of what you’re posting is actually in THIS setting. 
 My regular setting is only friends. My “old version” setting was public. So anything that I posted while running an old version of Facebook was visible to anyone looking at my profile. Changing this setting is a completely personal decision. I changed it to “only me” to be safe. 
 And we’re done with apps! Yay! Moving on to... ADS: - go back to the page where both apps and ads were an option - click ads 
 - click “your interests” You may find very specific things here. This section told me that a friend of mine was interested in European soccer. Which is true. #creepy 
 Facebook is running a system where this section liiiterally cannot be empty. You can’t have 0 interests. But, the more you delete, the broader and more arbitrary they become. I’m now down to “travel” and “nature.” - go back to previous page - click “your information” 
 This list is the information ad providers can see about you. - uncheck everything checked on this list - scroll all the way down - click “review and manage your categories” 
 This is the list of categories that ad providers have placed you in. They will be highly, weirdly, creepily specific. This allowed advertisers to cater to your actual preferences based on long-term harvesting of info. - delete everything on the list 
 - go back two pages - click “ads settings” There are 3 questions on this page, on how they can use info to run advertisements. The last one is using your interests on your timeline to alert your friends. This is not seen by the person posting it. - say no to all 3 questions 
 - go back to previous page Everything else on this page cannot be be changed. Clicking around might be helpful, but there isn’t anything more to do. We’re done! About time, right? 
 I hope this was helpful. Safe socializin’ people - we live in weird times. ✌🏼 /end</texto><total_retweets type="int">555</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">749</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">70</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">4</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Anger</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">928065895477395456</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">2653</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">362</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">13761</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">0.9617951477852832</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
