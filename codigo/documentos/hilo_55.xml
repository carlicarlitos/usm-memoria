 Â« I do think the more space we give people to think and be critical about what they see and express more critical thinking the more civil and civic these dialogs and debates become and the more we can really dive into the heart of the issue and move forward. Â» 
 Â« 280 and Threads have certainly allowed more depth in the conversations and a lot more critical thinking. One of the things we would like to see and enable on our platform is exactly that. Â» 
 Â« We do believe it has a potential but we donâ€™t know and thatâ€™s part of the point. [â€¦] We havenâ€™t figured out how to measure the effect of that on our platform. Â» 
 Â« This is a step in first admitting that we donâ€™t know how to measure that, second like, to do find the measurements and third to make sure we are exposing what weâ€™re measuring and sharing that and evolving it as quickly as we can. Â»
