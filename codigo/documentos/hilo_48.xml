 The new site goes well beyond expectations. It includes issue ads as well as explicitly political ones. It also includes information about the ads&apos; reach and details like different versions and how much money was spent. 
 The company seems to have realistic expectations, and to be taking ownership of their own past failings. That said, @Facebook&apos;s conduct or stock value is the least important part of the story. 
 The fact that campaign finance regulation is becoming a privatized space in the United States is absurd. It is a massive abdication of public authority. 
 There are no mechanisms to hold @Facebook accountable for how they do this, or whether they do it well. And even if they do it well now, the company can change that whenever they want. 
 Also: you have to be logged in to see the disclosures (h/t @digiphile). What&apos;s up with that, @facebook? Are you logging people&apos;s searches? 
 Bottom line: let&apos;s still pass the #HonestAds Act. Mark Zuckerberg himself supports it. https://t.co/2iaAEmlhcf</texto><total_retweets type="int">48</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">84</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">9</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">1</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">5743162</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">76021</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">548</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">22049</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.305213227966018</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
