How? #Racism &amp;amp; #scapegoating &amp;amp; affect all minorities. Deporting #DREAMers &amp;amp; undocumented #immigrants will have very negative impacts to the #economy. That affects everyone else. THREAD 1 #DreamActNow #immigration https://t.co/W8pRLNvT7b 
 The sociological concept of the “other” is important to this discussion. If you haven’t heard of it before, here is a brief overview from https://t.co/dXL54ysqAS. 2 #identity #race #sociology #Science https://t.co/SL2URYBB6o 
 People in power define social identities as they have the means to control the narrative – news coverage, platforms to broadcast their platforms, &amp;amp; the power to influence law enforcement and legislation. Social identity affects how people perceive themselves and others. 3 https://t.co/sTrKxTW5mR 
 People want to differentiate themselves from out-groups, as they have negative images. The in-group is united in differentiating itself from the out-group. It’s “us v. them”. 4 https://t.co/2aexzrGFwk #sociology https://t.co/VOVG5acWG1 
 How this relates to #DACA and #immigration: Trump’s admin is using a racist &amp;amp; biased narrative to establish immigrants as “others”, or an out-group. He uses claims that have been de-bunked to make immigrants look like bad people. 5 #falsenarrative #lie #LiarinChief #Blotus https://t.co/bTsTHsPcxb 
 Trump repeats the idea that unauthorized immigrants commit a lot of crime, so getting rid of immigrants will bring down crime &amp;amp; keep Americans safe. But the facts don’t back that up. 6 #prejudice #racism https://t.co/7RAL1KTInX 
 By repeating these lies, Trump has effectively established #immigrants as an “other”, or “out-group” of bad and dangerous people. Blaming #minority groups for societal problems is called #scapegoating, and it’s not new. 7 https://t.co/3jTGZDn6cc 
 Scapegoating minorities is an effective way to put them in the role of “out-groups”. Trump blames Muslims for terrorism and unauthorized immigrants (specifically Latinos) for crime to build support for his Muslim ban, border wall and anti-immigrant policies. 8 https://t.co/YRinIMYywT 
 Trump has also repeatedly stated that unauthorized immigrants cost the US a lot of money. That is not true. 9 #lie #fakenews #racist #bigot https://t.co/0Zenx33w24 
 Ending #DACA would cause a loss of $460.3 billion from the #GDP in the next decade. That does not include the COST OF DEPORTING PEOPLE when they lose DACA protection. Deportation costs #money. 10 https://t.co/UWsBLSgDmL 
 Trump’s claims about unauthorized immigrants have been proven false. He keeps repeating them to emphasize the idea that unauthorized immigrants are bad for the U.S. and it’s best to deport them. 11 #TrumpLies #LiarinChief #LiaroftheYear https://t.co/mZkomKa60q 
 Why is Trump so anti-immigrant if the facts don’t back up his statements? His family has a long history of racism, dating back to the 1970’s. 12 https://t.co/C67qtUuL1T 
 Scapegoating gives people who are angry and frustrated an outlet for their aggression on a target that can’t strike back. It’s a “safe” release valve for unhappy constituents to focus on and unite against. 13 https://t.co/rWFriVbNSS 
 Eight years of Obama caused a backlash from people who previously kept their racism hidden. We’ve seen this in the way that so many people dismissed and excused Trump’s racist statements. Some said Trump didn’t mean what he said. 13 #denial #rationalize https://t.co/bDiWDbeb2A 
 People said that about Hitler too. Specifically, the New York Times in 1922. 14 https://t.co/fH9JugwnRF https://t.co/ibAvX8xJnb 
 That proved untrue in both cases. Trump’s #MuslimBan, #BorderWall, his attempt to ban #trans troops, his support of “religious freedom” laws &amp;amp; his “shithole” remarks show his racism. 15 https://t.co/koMpgyhTlL #Trumpisawhitesupremacist 
 What’s the takeaway here? Be aware of these tactics. Look for them, and evaluate critically. Researching claims is easy with Google. #criticalthinking is an absolute MUST for everyone. #factsmatter more than ever now. 16 #thinkforyourself https://t.co/Euz5x9M4TQ 
 Why is critical thinking so important? Because Trump meets almost all of the warning signs of fascism. We HAVE to be aware of that to fight it. That means keeping our eyes open, evaluating the facts, and thinking critically. #Democracy depends on it. https://t.co/DR6A5zge72
