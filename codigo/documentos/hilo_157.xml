In 2013, #EricSchmidt, CEO @Google &amp;amp; #BillRichardson visited #NorthKorea together. Although it was &apos;cleared&apos; as a &apos;#HumanitarianMission&apos;, there was another more sinister purpose. Notice that these are #NK soldiers in the photos - clearly in some kind of &apos;Ops&apos; room. #QAnon https://t.co/oyBI0eLWb5 
 2. During their #NorthKorea visit, this video was taken. Notice how @EricSchmidt controls the conversation as they walk around. @Google was there to show-off new servers they had set up. Why would the #US be helping #NK - a hostile threat? #QAnon https://t.co/4Aiabbt57T 
 3. Computers are clearly a powerful weapon that would only help #NorthKorea further their #Agenda and increase the #NK threat level against the world. #QAnon 
 4. As many of us already know, @EricSchmidt, who abruptly resigned from @Google on December 21st last year, was a @CIA operative. So, what could possibly be the reason why #US #TaxDollars were spent so he and @Google could set up servers there in 2013? #QAnon 
 5. We at @AllActivists have our own theory, but we want to know what you think. So, why did @EricSchmidt and @Google set up servers in #NorthKorea in 2013? #QAnon 
 6. #QAnon has posted over and over that the @CIA had a #BlackOps site there to terrorize the world itself. Their aim was to start #WWIII by procuring their own missiles because they couldn&apos;t get access to #US #Military assets. https://t.co/BRCvM5jy9O 
 7. This led the @CIA to arm #NorthKorea, but allowing themselves a &apos;backdoor&apos; to remotely control the missile&apos;s guidance system after missiles were launched by #NK - enabling them to re-vector &amp;amp; retarget any location they wanted. #QAnon https://t.co/g7ezfu1f66 
 8. In short, the @CIA was aiming to destroy the world&apos;s economy by starting #WWIII. Today, that threat has been neutralized. Although, if @HillaryClinton and her cronies had won the highest office instead of @realDonaldTrump, the threat would still be VERY real. #QAnon https://t.co/2Aa9nbyUO9 
 9. Take a close look around. You can see the #SeaChange right in front of you. Any leverage #NorthKorea had has been permanently removed with the destruction of the #RogueCIA&apos;s missile program in December, 2018. #QAnon https://t.co/EvExPu7kYW 
 10. With the announcement of potential #PeaceTalks between #NorthKorea &amp;amp; the #UnitedStates, the future looks much brighter because @realDonaldTrump was elected instead of @HillaryClinton. Thank you #Q! #QAnon https://t.co/qOIeETjdl8 
 11. I mean #HolySchmidt! So, do you really think you know what&apos;s going on the in the world? Everything you think is the truth might not even be close. Remember...
