After following the Suggestions from @SpockResists below, dont forget to change your Search Settings as well! Instructions BelowðŸ‘‡ Then let&apos;s talk about what &quot;Shaddowbanning&quot; is Exactly &amp;amp; how to Recognize it! #Censorship #1A #DisplaySensitive https://t.co/E53eri9Htb 
 2. First off, As you can see here when I search for my Friend @SpockResists under the people tab, @Twitter does not turn up any results -but he defintely exists! To Solve this Click the Three Dots to the Right of the Search Bar. #SensitiveContentBan https://t.co/zRsxVrbDWO 
 3. This display has two settings. Uncheck the &quot;Hide Sensitive Content&quot; Feature. https://t.co/mvfX92qxvb 
 4.Go back to your Search&amp;amp; VoilÃ  he magically appears again! Crazy Right? So what does this Mean Moving Forward? Is this due to a new feature Twitter Included Monday with their New Rules? Why are Innocuous #Resistance accts suddenly being hidden as Sensitive Content by @Twitter? https://t.co/ccimrXnKvF 
 5. The Simple Answer is- there seems to be no true Rhyme or Reason as to who&apos;s acct is deemed &quot;Sensitive Content&quot; Those effected seem Randomly Impacted by this Phenomenon But, to learn more about what exactly a #Shadowban is anyway Start Here ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/pTwYgszMXq 
 6. To sum up, a #Shadowban is when your Tweets become hidden from those who do not follow you, making you rather unsearchable in Hashtag &amp;amp; People Searches Here&apos;s an example of what comes up when I search for myself, (as I am currently Shadowbanned) vs what normally shows up. https://t.co/l744fFWAGP 
 7. Yet, users are not given any rationale as to why they have been #Shadowbanned I never received an email or notif explaining a ToS violation or what &quot;content&quot; was flagged We are given little recourse to appeal this action while @Twitter is still working on an Appeal Process ðŸ˜’ https://t.co/StIr1xpSqO 
 8. For those who have followed myself, &amp;amp; others in #Resistance groups a while, We do not use Profane or Violent Language, or Images &amp;amp; Media that could be construed as such We are Dedicated to Spreading Accurate, Up to Fate Information &amp;amp; CTAs to help Effect Positive Change 
 9. But Despite Staying well within Twitter&apos;s ToS &amp;amp; Rules as far as we Know, This article outlines what little control users have over whether their content is marked as &quot;Sensitive&quot;, &amp;amp; just how Undefined &quot;Sensitive&quot; Content is on @Twitter #Censorship https://t.co/cqrz5czSox https://t.co/s2NpAtLxFd 
 10. Overall, Being Marked as &quot;Sensitive Content&quot; Stifles our voice within the @Twitter community, making it much harder for our Messages to have an Impact &amp;amp; to Engage with new Followers This has happened to Several Accts Simultaneously within #TheResistance in the last few days 
 11. #TheResistance accounts we know of that have been effected by this ban as of late are as follows: @gettinnoticedmo @BeSeriousUSA @EdKrassen @EzraBridger2017 @TheSWPrincess @Indy_Resists @Guinan2017 @SpockResists @1Jedi_Rey @AgentScullyGR @WomanResistorNC @finnick_Resists 
 12. @NatCookResists @AlexMunday_2017 @KellieResists @chappie_cat @TrinityResists @Elastigirl2018 @Havok_2018 @chillibeanboy @BuffyResists If you or anyone you know has also been effected by a #Shadowban and/or labeled &quot;Sensitive Content&quot; in the last few days pls add them below! 
 13. No one has seen so many #Resistance accounts hit by a #Shadowban or Hidden at one time. This may be an Unintentional Side Effect of Twitter&apos;s new Rules going into effect this Monday -but it throttles ones ability to #Resist Effectively on this platform. So what can we do? 
 14. First we can #SpeakOut! Use the Suggestions here to Contact @TwitterSupport &amp;amp;tell them that Stifling our Voices for Unclear Reasons with Little Recourse Violates our #FreeSpeech! Our Collective Voices are Vital to a free Society! H/t @TheSWPrincess https://t.co/zB04CXWeeL 
 15. Also for a simpler way to check if you &amp;amp; your friends are #Shadowbanned use this link ðŸ‘‡ Feel free to add people you find that are Shadowbanned in the replies, @Twitter needs to recognize the Scope of this Problem! H/t @Boba_Cup https://t.co/aDC4PW36Rp 
 16. To end, Social Media &amp;amp; the Internet as a Whole are key Communications Utilities that many of us now take for granted. At this time in our Country it is Vital for us to Disseminate Truthful Info &amp;amp; Build Bridges as we Continue on the Path to Preserve our #Democracy #FreeSpeech https://t.co/gSdHLQDM3y</texto><total_retweets type="int">489</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">592</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">49</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">12</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">830946630819991552</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">60418</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">40721</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">48048</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">0.8522850603976547</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
