 Oh look, there’s former @EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy hanging out at the Olympics in Rio and guess what? She flew there first class🔍✈️💸 #BootPruitt #memories https://t.co/4q1CuV7GKM 
 Gina McCarthy hooked her buddies up at Harvard with $45 million in grants, for an alleged independent study but it was in close contact with them the whole time but all we’re going to hear about is a $43k sound booth in a government office🙄 #ScottPruitt #Hypocrisy https://t.co/QCoKLhzleV 
 This is why media never talked about #EPA Gina McCarthy, she hated coal and worked vigorously to eliminate it. @EPAScottPruitt has cleared the way for AMERICAN JOBS and nothing pisses off @TheDemocrats more. #MondayMotivaton #ScottPruitt https://t.co/4ZMhlj5h17 
 Why doesn’t @TGowdySC write a letter to finally see Gina McCarthy’s conflict of interest, since former admin wouldn’t, he wrote quite the zinger about @EPAScottPruitt #TruthMatters https://t.co/lyislf1HBz https://t.co/ztvo86ay3t 
 Just checking out the Myan ruins because that’s official business right @EPA @USGAO @usgaolegal #EPA https://t.co/DqdhbxCRUb 
 Maybe we should ask how much it cost taxpayers for Gina McCarthy to fly to Cusco and Urubamba to play dress up with a Huilloc Indigenous girl, this seems totally work related right? #BootPruitt #DoubleStandard #EPA https://t.co/KxFdqvWjiO 
 WTF does reading have to do with the Environmental Protection Agency, oh my bad it was the “the magic school bus &amp;amp; climate change” that changes everything, this trip to Kigali seems totally legit now #ScottPruitt https://t.co/BQAIVzOjqf 
 Just a quick glance at #EPA Gina McCarthy record is quite interesting how did they spend $214,397 on a conference no one attended🤣Probably because of her precious Clean Water Act that crippled small businesses #ScottPruitt https://t.co/Qm1ACijyA3 
 Another gem from former #EPA $196,635 paid by the @EPA for a non-EPA traveler, that’s totally normal. Accountability is important but WHY have #Democrats just suddenly started doing it🤷🏼‍♀️ #SoreLosers https://t.co/9PbDJEBPXK 
 It’s all about control @EPAScottPruitt has been slashing the impossible and expensive regulations put in place by former #EPA meant to reduce sea level rise by 1/100th of an inch AND put people out of jobs in #Chicago all done with ZERO transparency🙄 https://t.co/rFl4zTF8HI 
 While Democrats and Republicans pursue an enema of all things @EPAScottPruitt former admin did whatever they pleased, including deleting records because it would’ve shown how hugely they hooked up outside agencies #EPA https://t.co/U4tC1bhamd 
 The former @EPA was rogue even a Federal Judge said so but muhhhh Scott Pruitt spent too much on a secure phone booth 💩 https://t.co/r9K305eEAM 
 Truth about the former #EPA 👇honestly all the politicians attacking @EPAScottPruitt should be looked at closely, chances are they have side deals that depend on all the regulations put in place that he’s now slashing. #TeamPruitt https://t.co/uKOsdqWhLH 
 🌏 Thank God for @EPAScottPruitt and @realDonaldTrump #MondayMotivaton #EPA https://t.co/DUv4BGY7GW
