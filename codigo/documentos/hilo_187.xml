Could this be pure strategy to set the Media up for its final fall, clearing the way for the upcoming MOAB of TRUTH? 
 #qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 2) Historically, Cyrus had to conquer the Medes prior to Babylon. If His-story repeats, then Trump has to conqueror the MEDia first before he finishes off the DeepState/Elites. How would he do this? 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 3) By positioning them into a place where everyone can see with no doubt they have LIED and spread a HUGE lie, that can be backed up with indisputable FACT. 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 4) January 4, the White House instituted a ban on personal cell phones. @PressSec said it begin to take effect next week, and didn&apos;t include the @POTUS . https://t.co/Nx8pcdxknB 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 5) Thursday last week, @SenatorDurbin and others made a visit to the President about #DACA deal. Afterwards, #trickyDick accused the President of being a racist, stating he made a #racist #Shithole remark. 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 6) side note: Durbin had said he thought it was just going to be a couple of people in the meeting, but turned out Trump then invited a few more. Good idea to have several witnesses, right? 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 7) Durbin claimed the president called third world countries #Shitholes . But there hasn&apos;t been any absolute comfirmation he really said that. Even @LindseyGrahamSC didn&apos;t come out and back Dick up with the exact word. 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 8) at least 2 others (Cotton &amp;amp; Perdue) stated they did not hear the president say that word. That&apos;s not enough to convince any Liberal or #TalkingHead media-ite. The story brewed all weekend long. 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 9) While the focus was on #Shithole gate, on Friday evening of a 3 day weekend, the first sealed indictment connected to #UraniumOne &amp;amp; the Clintons was posted to the DOJ website. No comment on this by 95% of the #PropagandaMachine 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 10) #Shithole had 24/7 coverage. A perfect cover for the bigger news story, and a set-up for the awards show on Wednesday. Still not enough, though, right? 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 11) Saturday night (14th), @PressSec disputed w/ @WSJ about another statement, &amp;amp; both provided recordings of alleged friendship b/t Trump and #Rocketman . Seems everyone intent on proving #DJT a liar. This was after #HawaiiFalseAlarm 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 12) 2 side notes: A--Julian Assange chess board tweet posted late Fri night, &amp;amp; B- OIG dropped some of the docs from report as well, setting stage for #TheBigUgly supposedly coming today. No liberal will want 2 believe the #PlotTwist 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 13) Compound this with @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas expose of Tw*tt3r bias, manipulation, corruption. This is a recipe for a MOAB, isnt it? 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 14) How do we get to the Awards show being completely validated as truth on Wednesday? Maybe via a *recording* of the #Durbin #Shithole show, proving #TrickyDick lied, and proving @POTUS never even uttered the word? 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 15) Before the &quot;Unbelievable&quot; Sting Op of Horowitz/Assange/Mueller 3 prong attack can be released, the #Liars have to be PROVEN to be liars, not trusted to give facts and truth. 
 #Qanon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 16) The methane build-up in the #Shithole &apos;outhouse&apos; #Shitshow will make the explosion bad. (Anyone but me remember blowing up outhouses as sport?) https://t.co/bIvqB0Ax1s 
 #QAnon bible students re: #FakeNewsAwards 17) Tw*tt3r &quot;ate&quot; my first [17] end post, proof of #twittling w/our tw33ts.
