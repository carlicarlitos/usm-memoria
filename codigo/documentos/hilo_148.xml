 Former NRA board member Cleta Mitchell (also did legal work for them) is one of MANY people whom House Intel Democrats want to interview. Democratic Senate Intel investigators also are interested in what she may know about relationships btwn the NRA and wealthy Russians.🧐 2/ 
 Get this. In addition to being a gun lover (of course🙄), Mitchell is an *election law specialist* and veteran conservative operative.🤨 Meaning: she should know that it’s ILLEGAL for #Russians🇷🇺to donate ANY money that is spent on political campaigns‼️ 3/ 
 Mitchell claims that any suggestion she has “concerns” about the NRA&apos;s #Russia🇷🇺connections is a &quot;complete fabrication.&quot;🤔 Yet @McClatchyDC cites two sources. 4/ 
 The #NRA spent over $30 million (other estimates are &amp;gt;$70 million) to help propel Trump’s campaign.🤬 And now, the FBI is probing alleged ILLEGAL donations from “lifetime” NRA member &amp;amp; #Russian🇷🇺oligarch, Alexander Torshin.🤨 5/ https://t.co/Xf6VOmVPrh 
 Mitchell was among *more than two dozen people* House Intel Democrats want to interview, including 2 other figures w/ties to Torshin and the #NRA.🤔 But of course, the House Intel #Reoublicans SHUT DOWN the probe.🙄 6/ 
 Specifically, House Intel Democrats want to know if Mitchell “can shed light on the #NRA’s relationship with Alexander Torshin” or other Russians and also want to see financial records from a South Dakota company and a #Russian gun rights group.🤨 7/ 
 Mitchell has QUITE the resumé. Most interestingly, she has helped set up *DARK MONEY political nonprofit groups* that can legally spend funds on elections but keep donors SECRET‼️👿 DING, DING, bloody DING‼️ 8/ #EndCitizensUnited 
 Gee, no surprise, Mitchell has also worked for #Republican Trump boot-lickers, such as Senators Roy Blunt, Pat Toomey, and Marco Rubio.🤢🤮 9/ cc @ericgarland 
 Thanks to #CitizensUnited, which essentially legalized certain aspects of political #corruption, the #NRA’s total revenue SURGED to $336.7 million in 2016.🤬 10/ 
 Importantly, the #NRA’s political nonprofit 501c4 does NOT have to disclose its donors publicly. Nor does it have to disclose its specific expenditures.🤨 Meaning: it can raise and spend UNLIMITED cash on political campaigns with ZERO transparency‼️🤬 11/ #EndCitizensUnited 
 Friends, no matter what you think about whether people and/or corporations should be allowed to donate UNLIMITED amounts of cash to support political campaigns, I hope that we can ALL agree that EVERY dollar — whether donated or spent — should be disclosed PUBLICLY‼️ 12/ 
 Our current lack of TRANSPARENCY in campaign finance laws has opened the door WIDE OPEN for #corruption‼️ Regardless of your political party, we should DEMAND transparency in political donations.🇺🇸 13/ #CountryOverParty cc @counterchekist https://t.co/52PPYn5VdK 
 No matter your political views, I hope that we can all agree that EVERY DOLLAR that is spent supporting political campaigns should be TRANSPARENT, including from whom the money was received &amp;amp; for which candidate money was spent‼️ If not, we’ve LEGALIZED #corruption‼️ 14/ 
 The *best* part of this whole #TrumpRussia🇷🇺 fiasco is that people from across the political spectrum agree that our COUNTRY comes first‼️🇺🇸 Let’s unite together and demand FULL transparency of how our elected leaders are bankrolled. We Americans DESERVE it‼️🇺🇸 /end</texto><total_retweets type="int">2809</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">5345</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">174</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">11</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
