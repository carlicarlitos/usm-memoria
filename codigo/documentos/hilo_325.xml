 2/ A Jim Comey level of terrible. I refer you to the first 45 minutes of Morning Joe yesterday. You can watch it on demand. 
 3/ And it&apos;s more than my usual &quot;why is Bernie speaking for Democrats&quot; primal scream 
 4/ Bc now instead of discussing what’s wrong with Graham Cassidy, convo shifts to why it’s at least better than &quot;Berniecare&quot; 
 5/ It should be Conyers-care but this is Bernie we&apos;re talking about, so Bernie-care it shall be, and that means &quot;socialism&quot; 
 6/ I’m going to get flamed about how it isn’t socialism but calm down, I know this and I agree with you, but that’s not the point 
 7/ To the GOP, Obamacare is socialism, even without public option, so m4a is unfathomable to them. 
 8/ Yes, calling it socialism is a scare tactic, but it&apos;s a scare tactic that works. Might as well say communism. Many have. 
 9/ Some ask, why would Collins and Murkowski be swayed by Bernie and you’re right, they wouldn’t. The issue is framing. 
 10/ When they start polling m4a vs Graham-Cassidy instead of ACA vs Graham-Cassidy and the GC numbers increase... 
 11/ If &amp;amp; when support reaches critical mass in their states, Murkowski and Collins will have no choice but to vote for repeal. 
 12/ GOP only has until the 30th to repeal ACA under reconciliation. After that it takes 60 votes. They def don’t have 60 votes 
 13/ But they might have 50, which is why the timing is problematic. And suspicious. Why not wait one week? 
 14/ This is also a problem for m4A, if you want that to succeed. This “debate” will allow Graham to savage m4A as introduced. 
 15/ m4a that everyone signed onto isn&apos;t really legislation, it’s an outline. There’s no funding mechanism. It hasn&apos;t even been scored. 
 16/ Even if McConnell wanted to hold hearings tomorrow a completely new bill would have to be drafted. 
 17/ So when Bernie goes in bumper sticker slogans, no funding mechanism, no CBO score, Graham will eviscerate him 
 18/ He’ll have an independent score and a takedown of the most unappetizing funder they can dream up 
 19/ He&apos;ll arguing worst case scenario strawmen and terrifying projections, tax implications, shortages, and worse. 
 20/ Since our side has nothing, charges will be impossible to refute, and will be on record for 2018 political ads against Dems 
 21/ Once Graham exposes its flaws, the bill it will be DOA no matter what happens with ACA, and we’ll have to start over 
 22/ As I said, we’d have to start over anyway, but this will bring that “momemtum” Berners like to crow about to a screeching halt. 
 23/ So to recap, this debate is bad for Democrats in 2018, bad for the future of m4a, bad for everything except what? 
 24/ *all together now* Feeding Bernie’s ego 
 25/ All we&apos;re asking for is 7 days.
