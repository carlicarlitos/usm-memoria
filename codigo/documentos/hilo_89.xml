 Mueller already was probing attempts by the UAE to &quot; buy political influence&quot; by supporting Trump’s campaign.🤔 Then *after* #Qatar refused to bail out Kush’s 666 Fifth Ave properly, Trump sided w/the UAE &amp;amp; #SaudiArabia AGAINST Qatar.🤨 2/ #Corruption https://t.co/wYN1OSShu6 
 George Nader — a Lebanese-American pal of Erik Prince, who’s been pushing pro-UAE interests — and #Republican DONOR Elliott Broidy, participated in the meetings.🤔 Nader FLIPPED and is cooperating w/Mueller‼️😎 3/ 
 In addition to the UAE, Broidy was also angling to influence DOJ to drop its probe of #Malaysia’s 1MDB👉🏼suspected of #MoneyLaundering and other alleged crimes.🤨 4/ https://t.co/7h3bwykBcO 
 Broidy is also linked to Rick Gates’ movie production company. Gates’ partner pleaded GUILTY to #MoneyLaundering, fraud &amp;amp; identity theft.🙄 Gates’ co-producers funneled cash to a DARK MONEY political nonprofit👈🏼Broidy served on its board‼️ 5/ https://t.co/okKlldjDqz 
 “Bad news” Broidy previously pleaded GUILTY for illegally funneling money to NY pension fund authorities.🤔 DO YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS HEADING⁉️ Mueller is probing ALL of the DIRTY MONEY that illegally flowed into #GOP and Trump campaign coffers‼️😎6/ https://t.co/wpASV8jr0T 
 Qatari officials met w/Trump officials in Jan/Feb. Trump endorsed the UAE/Saudi blockade in June AFTER #Qatar bailed on Kush.🤔 Qataris also met w/FBI Dir Chris Wray, but “never shared” their info about UAE&apos;s influence on the administration, likely b/c MUELLER ALREADY KNEW.😎 7/ 
 Broidy is KNOWN to have MASSIVE business ties w/UAE. #Qatar says Broidy influenced the Trump administration &amp;amp; claims to have EVIDENCE showing his connection to the UAE.🤔 8/ #FARA https://t.co/1RL8C79Gfw 
 FOURTEEN lobbying &amp;amp; PR firms filed #FARA as agents of Qatar, UAE or Saudi Arabia since Trump&apos;s blockade endorsement.🤨 Mercury lobbied in favor of Qatar, Podesta Group lobbied for Saudi Arabia, and BOTH worked w/Manafort for the pro-#Russia party in Ukraine.🙄 9/ 
 Friends, this is just a SMALL glimpse of the SHADY players in our political system, with MANY foreign agents NEVER filing #FARA. Even worse, #CitizensUnited allows ANONYMOUS &amp;amp; UNLIMITED cash into the political system👉🏼opened the floodgates for #corruption‼️🤬 10/ 
 The #SteeleDossier warned that #Russia🇷🇺was a smokescreen for Trump’s #corruption in other countries.🤨 Notice that this latest twist in Mueller’s probe involves countries OTHER than Russia⁉️ That’s b/c Mueller’s investigation is GLOBAL‼️😎 /end #MuellerTime</texto><total_retweets type="int">2123</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">3487</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">114</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">13</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
