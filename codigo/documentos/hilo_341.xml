 Livestream: Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing on Worldwide Threats https://t.co/zjuqhHYqaJ 2/ 
 DNI Dan Coats: &quot;We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false flags&quot; &amp;amp; other influence operations. &quot;There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful, and views the 2018 elections as another opportunity...&quot; 3/ https://t.co/qtTstHeKII 
 Sen. @MarkWarner notes that despite Russia&apos;s continued efforts to &quot;target and undermine our democratic institutions...the president continues to deny the threat posed by Russia.&quot; We need a strong response, and &quot;that response needs to start with leadership from the top.&quot; 4/ https://t.co/9HEDwNLLLt 
 Every single leader in the US intelligence community just agreed that there is no evidence that Russian activity (interference) has decreased since 2016/2017, and that they are expecting Russia to continue their activities, including attempted interference in 2018 elections. 5/ https://t.co/FnbyPlsU6s 
 Sen. @MarkWarner asks who or what agency is in charge of combatting Russia&apos;s use of social media as a tool of influence/interference. Answer: There isn&apos;t one. 6/ 
 .@SenatorRisch says he thinks the American people are prepared &amp;amp; have learned from 2016; says people recognize that there are bad actors trying to manipulate them &amp;amp; will evaluate info more critically. I would invite @SenatorRisch to study my Twitter feed and articles. 7/ 
 Since 2016, more Americans have become witting &amp;amp; unwitting agents of Russian influence. Americans are not prepared for Russian influence operations nor information warfare, and it&apos;s dangerous to pretend otherwise. 8/ https://t.co/sGVBs3D6eE 
 Notably, DNI Coats specifically warned that Russia will continue &quot;to use sympathetic spokesmen” as part of its influence operations in the US. Sympathetic voices = Those voices (&amp;amp; bots) that have made Russian propaganda indecipherable from pro-Trump talking points. 9/ 
 Sen. @RonWyden raises topic of security clearances, asks FBI Director Christopher Wray: Was the FBI aware of allegations related to Rob Porter and domestic abuse? Was the WH informed? When were they informed? Who was informed? What was their response? 10/ 
 -NSA Dir. Mike Rogers (responding to Sen. @RonWyden) says he *did* raise concerns about Nunes memo w/DNI Coats. -FBI Christopher Wray indicates he did the same. ... -Wyden asks: Anything you can say in open session? -Wray: We had grave concerns. 11/ 
 FBI Director Wray re. Rob Porter&apos;s clearance: We submitted a partial report to the WH in March and a completed background investigation in July. WH asked us to do followup, which we provided in Nov. We closed the file in January. Not good for WH... 12/ https://t.co/th5Cy54GCl 
 Based on FBI Director Wray&apos;s response, the White House knew at least something about the allegations against Rob Porter in MARCH. So... the WH has a lot of explaining to do, because that&apos;s definitely not the story we were told by Sarah Sanders/John Kelly/Trump/etc. 13/ 
 DNI Coats says anyone w/o full security clearance should not be receiving our country&apos;s most sensitive intelligence. That would mean Jared Kushner. 14/ 
 CIA director Pompeo strongly hints that US has retaliated for Russia&apos;s interference in 2016 election (&amp;amp; that the Kremlin knows it). Yet he also agreed w/ DNI Coats that Russian interference is ongoing &amp;amp; we should expect more...indicating that whatever we did, didn&apos;t work. 15/ 
 I would note that all of the intelligence leaders say the US &quot;is under attack&quot; and &quot;is being targeted&quot; by Russian operations. They&apos;re not saying we were attacked or will be attacked again — they&apos;re saying we are currently being attacked. Too bad POTUS won&apos;t say that. 16/ 
 Sen. @KamalaHarris poses a critical question to FBI Christopher Wray: &quot;Should the president recuse himself from reviewing and declassifying intelligence related to the [Russia investigation/counterintelligence probe]&quot;? Wray: He [Trump] should discuss recusal w/WH counsel. 17/ 
 !!! --&amp;gt; Responding to Sen. @KamalaHarris, DNI Coats says he&apos;d &quot;have to get back to her&quot; but that he &quot;does not believe&quot; there is a written plan for the US intel community to deal with Russian interference via social media. 18/ 
 .@SenJackReed asks intel leaders if they&apos;ve received specific directives from Trump to combat Russian interference. None cite specific directives. NSA Dir. Mike Rogers says: &quot;I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve been given explicit directives to actively blunt or stop&quot; Russian activities. 19/ 
 .@SenatorBurr says the Senate Intel Committee hopes to have an overview of *some* of their findings by the 2018 midterm elections. Also says the committee plans to have an open hearing on election security &amp;amp; provide recommendations before midterms. 20/ https://t.co/spuJQqydsO 
 Open hearing of Senate Intel Committee is now over. Closed (classified) hearing will be held next. A few notes from earlier that I didn&apos;t have time to tweet... 21/ 
 Notable exchange: Sen. Tom Cotton asks FBI Director Wray if the FBI still agrees w/ Comey’s view from last yr that Steele dossier is “salacious &amp;amp; unverified.&quot; Wray doesn’t take the bait. Says he might be able say more in closed hearing. Implying that something has changed? 22/ 
 DNI Coats delivered what might be the most striking statement of the hearing: &quot;Frankly, the United States is under attack&quot; and &quot;we expect Russia [to continue] using elections as opportunities to undermine democracy, sow discord and undermine our values.&quot; 23/ https://t.co/cgpxHqtXNR 
 It took a little prying, but @SenJackReed&apos;s questioning ended with every intel leader admitting that Trump has never given them any specific directives re. preventing, blunting or stopping Russian interference — something they all acknowledge is an ongoing threat to nat sec. 24/ https://t.co/VBaRhhmJhI 
 Notably, Democrats only asked Q&apos;s about Russian interference &amp;amp; the integrity of the investigation — I can&apos;t think of a single Q. re Trump campaign coordination w/ Russia. GOP (mainly Sen. Cotton), however, tried to throw a partisan dagger in w/ Q&apos;s about Steele dossier. 25/ 
 It&apos;s clear that intel leaders recognize Russia&apos;s exploitation of social media to manipulate Americans &amp;amp; sow discord as a major threat, but DNI Coats said there isn&apos;t an agency or point person designated to deal with it, &amp;amp; there isn&apos;t a written plan to respond to/combat it. 26/ https://t.co/qPDpIglevy</texto><total_retweets type="int">13889</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">27573</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">314</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">0</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Anger</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">2316383071</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">390915</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">3785</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">80602</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.2214641411254101</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
