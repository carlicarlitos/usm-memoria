I think I stumbled upon something REALLY, REALLY HUGE. It regards the meaning of Q, and possibly the identity of the people behind it. It has to do with this drop, here: https://t.co/iMIU1VVpIj 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (2) Ever since I started following Q in late November, I took for granted the accepted interpretation: Q is related to DOE &quot;Q Clearance&quot; - and the connection to the U1 scandal etc. BUT https://t.co/Zjvopx2SaU 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (3) An ex-marine friend and researcher - who wishes to remain anonymous - found something which is BIG, IMO. AND MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE THE TRUTH BEHIND IT. Please refer to the crumb, again. https://t.co/PQuVdJVWLP 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (4) If you look in the structure of No Such Agency, you find the Associate Directorate for Security and Counterintelligence - or THE Q GROUP. https://t.co/RyziTHIUwm 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (5) Here&apos;s the link to the full structure of the Agency: https://t.co/FOlUWfypem 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (6) Who is helping POTUS? What agency is at WAR with Clowns? https://t.co/x90JsP5kBM 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (7) Now, we have talked a lot about Snow White being a treasonous Clown operator. So, look at THAT: https://t.co/Bv4lrb08IY 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (8) Here&apos;s the full article: https://t.co/PxekLAq9Bm 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (9) More than ever, I quote Q: TRUST ROGERS!!! /END https://t.co/Xgtw3qDHHd 
 ADDENDUM: Let me make this clear: THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION of who knows what first. But two days ago I wrote about the Q team, saying it had to do with Q clearance from DOE and NOBODY came to correct me and give me the right clue. But now a lot of people claim it was obvious. ðŸ‘¾ 
 SO, I GOT PERMISSION TO REVEAL THAT THIS GREAT CATCH IS THE WORK OF @dlfield who is an &quot;acronym freak&quot; and - it turns out - a very good researcher, too. Follow him, patriots. He doesn&apos;t post much. But when he does, it&apos;s gold!!! 
 @threadreaderapp please, unroll! Thanks! 
 Today, for the first time, I&apos;m getting a lot of bad vibe from people here. People complaining, criticizing me, trying to tell me what to write or not... I will block them all!!! They will not spoil the wonderful experience I&apos;m having of interacting with the patriots. ðŸ‘¾</texto><total_retweets type="int">414</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">1132</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">123</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">3</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Anger</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">938139949710405633</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">38539</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">6586</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">39448</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">0.9516930813158719</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
