Hope you&apos;ll pass it on. https://t.co/WEY0Rbxnt6 
 BOMBSHELL: The White House lied repeatedly about how active Trump&apos;s secretive NatSec Advisory Committee was—it met MANY times, not &quot;once.&quot; 
 BOMBSHELL: Kremlin agents lured Page to Russia to meet Kremlin officials and Rosneft execs AFTER he joined the campaign; it wasn&apos;t his idea. 
 BOMBSHELL: MANY Trump campaign aides AND NatSec team members knew Page was going to Russia post-hacking revelations—none tried to stop him. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page bypassed top policy aides and NatSec peers in telling HOPE HICKS he was going to Russia—suggesting he wanted TRUMP to know. 
 BOMBSHELL: Given Page and JD Gordon&apos;s words, Hicks LIED to the media in saying the campaign had no Russia contacts; she&apos;s a key witness now. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page spoke to the FBI 5-6 times in 2016-7; if he told them what he told Congress, he can be charged with Making False Statements. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page deliberately withheld deeply inculpatory documents from Congress using a false and legally fraudulent Fifth Amendment claim. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page met the same Kremlin official and Rosneft exec in BOTH July and December 2016 and lied about BOTH interactions to Congress. 
 BOMBSHELL: On July 7, 2016, the Kremlin asked Page to carry a message to Trump: we strongly support you and want to work with you on policy. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page admits discussing sanctions policy with both the Kremlin and Rosneft in July; after, he briefed the campaign on these talks. 
 BOMBSHELL: As Page briefed the NatSec team and the campaign on his secret Russia meetings, every Trump aide who denied Russia contacts lied. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page was certain to keep Trump&apos;s daily assistant, Hope Hicks, in the loop—Sessions, too—so Trump and Sessions knew what Page did. 
 BOMBSHELL: As of mid-July, Trump&apos;s campaign was *on notice* Russia supported it, wanted to help it, and was offering &quot;outreach&quot;—cooperation. 
 BOMBSHELL: When Trump said &quot;Russia, if you&apos;re listening...&quot; and asked it to release Clinton emails, he was *responding* to Russian outreach. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page *directly* revealed his Moscow plans to Sessions at an event Sessions set up—didn&apos;t disclose—and sat beside Papadopoulos at. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page admits &quot;the whole [NatSec] group&quot; got Papadopoulos&apos; March 2016 email on the Kremlin wanting to meet—that&apos;d include Sessions. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page proposed the campaign tell him what to say in Moscow—thus, *to Kremlin agents*—and/or have Trump take the trip in his place. 
 BOMBSHELL: Everything the Steele Dossier said about Page appears to be either exactly accurate or so close to it as to be indistinguishable. 
 BOMBSHELL: During his July &apos;16 trip Page discussed the upcoming sale of Rosneft with Rosneft&apos;s Investor Relations chief—a key dossier claim. 
 BOMBSHELL: AFTER we knew of Russia hacking—but BEFORE Trump changed the GOP platform to benefit Putin—Page told Clovis Russia favored Trump. 
 BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team talked lifting sanctions on Russia—maybe unilaterally—from its earliest days, *right after* the Mayflower Speech. 
 BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team knew Page was headed to Moscow as a &quot;private citizen&quot; concurrent to discussing sending a &quot;private citizen&quot; there. 
 BOMBSHELL: Multiple NatSec team members (at least 3) went to Budapest, the European HQ for Russian intelligence; Page met &quot;a Russian&quot; there. 
 BOMBSHELL: At least 7 of the NatSec team&apos;s 14 members were on an email about the GOP platform change—and at least TEN campaign members knew. 
 BOMBSHELL: None of the NINE campaign members who *knew* Manafort was lying about Trump&apos;s role in the GOP platform change revealed the truth. 
 BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST ten members of the campaign and the NatSec team knew they were helping Putin at a time the Kremlin was supporting Trump. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page met Kremlin/Rosneft officials in Moscow in December &apos;16—including contact with the MANAGER of Putin&apos;s election interference. 
 CONCLUSION: These 28 bombshells are what we learned simply from DECEITFUL Congressional testimony. So just IMAGINE what MUELLER knows. {end}</texto><total_retweets type="int">35440</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">84096</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">420</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">0</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Surprise</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="number">3223426134</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">670013</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">37</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">51875</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">2.258361470728224</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
