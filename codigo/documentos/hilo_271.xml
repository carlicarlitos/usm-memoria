 Specifically, Team🇺🇸Mueller is probing whether Trump was aware of plans for #WikiLeaks to publish the STOLEN emails.🤔 OF COURSE, Trump *knew*, because PapaD told the campaign about the stolen emails‼️ And PapaD is squealing.😎 2/ 
 PapaD got drunk and spilled his guts to an Aussie &quot;diplomat&quot; in London about #Russia&apos;s🇷🇺plan to &quot;anonymously release&quot; Democratic emails. And how? That&apos;s right. WIKILEAKS w/whom Trump Jr and Roger Stone were corresponding DURING the campaign‼️ 3/ #Busted cc @911CORLEBRA777 https://t.co/DXAEpMuLhk 
 So #SHOCKER (not), Team🇷🇺Mueller is probing whether Trump knew of plans for WikiLeaks to publish the STOLEN emails. If Trump knew, that&apos;s a CRIME‼️ (Spoiler alert: Trump knew) 4/ #TrumpRussia #RICO 
 Team🇺🇸Mueller also asked witnesses about the relationship btwn Roger Stone &amp;amp; #WikiLeaks&apos; Julian Assange, and why Trump took policy positions favorable to #Russia🇷🇺. Gee, why would Trump be favorable to Russia?🙄 5/ #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime 
 🔥Mueller has asked WITNESSES (meaning: MULTIPLE) about Trump&apos;s public comments in Jul&apos;16 asking #Russia to HACK Hillary&apos;s emails: &quot;Russia, if you&apos;re listening, I hope you&apos;re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.&quot; 6/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Then-WH spokesman, Spicey, later claimed that then-candidate Trump had been &quot;joking&quot; when he called on #Russia to hack his opponent&apos;s emails.🙄 But you know that Mueller is NOT buying this bunkum AT ALL‼️ 7/ #MuellerTime #RICO 
 🔥Witnesses (MULTIPLE) have been asked if Trump knew *in July 2016* that John Podesta had already been targeted, *MONTHS BEFORE* Podesta&apos;s stolen emails were leaked‼️ 8/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Mueller also asked witnesses if &quot;someone outside the campaign&quot; advised Trump to ask #Russia🇷🇺to hack Clinton&apos;s emails, and whether Trump tried to COORDINATE the release of the STOLEN emails to do the most damage to Clinton.🧐 (Spoiler alert: YES) 9/ #Busted #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 🔥STONE🔥 Mueller is probing Trump&apos;s longtime relationship w/Stone, Stone&apos;s contacts w/#WikiLeaks DURING the campaign &amp;amp; if Stone met w/Assange.😎 10/ #RICO #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime 
 Here&apos;s what someone who was INTERVIEWED by Mueller said about #Stone: &quot;They wanted to see if there was a scheme. Was Stone working on the side for Trump?&quot; AFTER he officially left the campaign.🤨 &quot;Was this a big plot&quot;⁉️ (Spoiler alert: YES) 11/ https://t.co/dnaYwblEFj 
 Thanks to @RepAdamSchiff&apos;s memo, we know that #Russian🇷🇺agents told PapaD about their plot to hack and disseminated STOLEN emails. PapaD was *desperate* to advance his career. He told an Aussie about the #Russian plot, so he certainly told the Trump campaign‼️ 12/ https://t.co/vuaFxcoHEf 
 And of course, we also know about Jr&apos;s &quot;treasonous&quot; meeting with the #RussianLawyer🇷🇺in Trump Tower (along w/Manafort &amp;amp; Kush), where they discussed #sanctions &amp;amp; HRC #kompromat w/a &quot;former&quot; Russian spy, who is expert in getting HACKED info‼️ 13/ https://t.co/jg7wGEJR40 
 Mueller is probing Stone&apos;s statements that strongly suggest he KNEW of info that #WikiLeaks had BEFORE it was public and when it would be released. Just weeks after Stone&apos;s tweet, Podesta&apos;s STOLEN emails were leaked by WikiLeaks.🙄 TWEETS are gonna nail these traitors‼️🤣 14/ https://t.co/03H2Izky2o 
 Concurrent with Stone&apos;s conspiring with #WikiLeaks, and WikiLeaks *strategically publishing* STOLEN emails in the final stages of the campaign, Trump *himself* publicly PRAISED them, saying, &quot;I love WikiLeaks!&quot;🙄 15/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Mueller is also probing Stone&apos;s connections w/WikiLeaks &amp;amp; Assange. Stone DENIED communicating w/them &amp;amp; said he communicated w/Assange &amp;amp; WikiLeaks through an intermediary. @NatashaBertrand just reported that Stone exchanged DMs w/WikiLeaks.😎 16/ #Busted https://t.co/Y4ktw1peO0 
 Investigators have asked witnesses about Stone&apos;s time on the campaign and what his relationship was like with Trump after he left.🤨 &quot;How often did they talk? Who really fired him? Was he really fired?&quot; Answers: Often. No one. NOPE‼️😉 17/ 
 Stone claims he had &quot;no advance knowledge of the content or source of information published by WikiLeaks.&quot; &quot;I have not been interviewed by the special counsel.&quot; That&apos;s because Stone is a TARGET of Mueller&apos;s grand jury‼️🤗 18/ 
 At the SAME Jul&apos;16 news conference, Trump asked #Russia🇷🇺to hack Clinton&apos;s emails &amp;amp; said he was open to lifting #sanctions. Mueller is probing why Trump took pro-Russia policy positions &amp;amp; spoke positively about Putin.🤔 Answer: #kompromat 19/ 
 Mueller is also probing WHEN Trump first met his pal Putin, and whether they met during Trump&apos;s 2013 Miss Universe Moscow.🧐 Of course, Trump has given &quot;conflicting responses&quot; (LIES) on when he first met Putin.🙄 20/ 
 *At least one witness* has been asked about Dan SCAVINO, specifically about any involvement he may have had in the campaign&apos;s DATA OPERATION‼️ 21/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Witnesses also have been asked about notorious &quot;dirty trickster&quot; Stone&apos;s connections to #Russian🇷🇺agent Manafort. You know, the guys who&apos;ve known each other FOREVER‼️ 22/ https://t.co/PY9qemISIt 
 Team🇺🇸Mueller knows MUCH more than what&apos;s in this report (and MUCH earlier). Have ZERO doubts.
