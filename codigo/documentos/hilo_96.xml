 Mueller has been asking witnesses about Trump&apos;s #Russian🇷🇺business activities *as he considered a run for president*, including the timing of Trump&apos;s decision to run, #kompromot the Russians may have on Trump, and why Trump Tower Moscow fell through.😎 2/ 
 Mueller is probing *beyond the campaign* to explore how the #Russians🇷🇺 INFLUENCED Trump when he was pushing Trump Tower Moscow *simultaneously* while considering a presidential run.🤨 3/ #PutinsPuppet #TrumpRussia https://t.co/X1fPOF0WHt 
 Mueller asked one witness when Trump became serious about running for president. Mueller was *very interested* in when Trump ACTUALLY decided to run and how that COINCIDED w/his #Russian🇷🇺business ventures.🤔 (Hint: Miss Universe Moscow in 2013 😉) 4/ #TrumpRussia 
 Mueller&apos;s questioning has centered on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow &amp;amp; unsuccessful negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow👉🏼both partnered w/Aras Agalarov &amp;amp; his son Emin, who &quot;just happened&quot; to arrange the #RussianLawyer🇷🇺meeting w/Manafort, Jr &amp;amp; Kush in Jun&apos;16.🙄 5/ 
 Don Jr testified to Congress that &quot;preliminary discussions&quot; w/the Agalarovs (close Putin pals) on Trump Tower Moscow began after the Miss Universe pageant. Trump tweeted *in Nov&apos;13*👉🏼&quot;Trump Tower-Moscow is next.&quot; Bad news for Donny: tweets ARE admissible as evidence.🤗 6/ https://t.co/akhH3ZfA6Y 
 One source said, based on the questions, Team🇺🇸Mueller was focused on the FINANCING of the Miss Universe Pageant👉🏼who paid for what &amp;amp; what money was paid to whom.🤨 7/ 
 Trump Org never disclosed how much it was paid for Miss Universe in Moscow. Trump&apos;s lawyers said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary that Trump Org made $12.2 million from foreign sources in 2013👉🏼&quot;substantial portion&quot; came from the Moscow event.🤔 8/ https://t.co/k6KlTZ8ISf 
 Mueller is also probing WHAT HAPPENED during Miss Universe Moscow. Questions focused on meetings Trump had w/#Russian🇷🇺business people or gov&apos;t officials, leading the source &quot;to believe the investigators were probing the possibility of #kompromat on Trump.😎 9/ 
 Specifically, investigators are probing *logistics surrounding TRUMP&apos;S HOTEL ROOM in Moscow*👉🏼WHO was there? Who had ACCESS? Who was in charge of SECURITY (Schiller)? Who was moving around w/him during the trip (Aras Agalarov)⁉️ 10/ https://t.co/LKb3ZNjbfK 
 Reminder: the #SteeleDossier reported about the alleged &quot;pee-pee&quot; tape (in actuality, sources tell me that real &quot;tape&quot; is MUCH worse). Indeed, Trump&apos;s &quot;use of extensive sexual services&quot; in St. Petersburg, as well as Moscow, is believed to be part of the REAL #kompromat.🤢🤮 11/ https://t.co/so84UzDdWg 
 About 2 yrs after Miss Universe Moscow, TMichael Cohen began negotiating w/another #Russian🇷🇺company for Trump Tower Moscow &amp;amp; Trump signed a etter of intent in Oct&apos;15 DURING THE CAMPAIGN. Mueller&apos;s team is probing ALL of this.😎 12/ 
 During the campaign Trump LIED and insisted that he had &quot;nothing to do w/#Russia🇷🇺&quot; even though the prospective Trump Tower Moscow deal fell through *just a few weeks* before the Iowa caucuses.🙄 13/ https://t.co/v5oIC6Yrgk 
 Like nearly everything in Team🇺🇸Mueller&apos;s investigation, what is revealed publicly is just the TIP of the iceberg &amp;amp; occurred MUCH earlier. Mueller is ALL OVER Trump&apos;s shady business deals in #Russia🇷🇺 and Trump can&apos;t bully, bluster, or bribe his way out this time‼️😎 /end</texto><total_retweets type="int">1941</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">4838</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">161</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">10</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
