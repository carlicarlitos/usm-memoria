Flynn may have met with Turkish officials WEEKS b4 Trump&apos;s inauguration for deal to be paid to SECRETLY push Turkey agenda WHILE in WH. https://t.co/Okd1QZ2kqt 
 2. That, my friends, is what George Washington and what the law defines as TREASON. Just so we&apos;re clear. PURE, simple TREASON. 
 3. Mueller team recently interviewed witnesses to the alleged meeting, that would have taken place in Dec. 2016. 
 4. The questions were part of a line of inquiry regarding Flynn&apos;s lobbying efforts on behalf of Turkey. https://t.co/0dQSsWWchO 
 5. ON TOP OF the infamous Gulen kidnapping we know about, Flynn may have conspired to FREE A TURKISH/IRANIAN gold trader who is IN JAIL IN US. 
 6. Guess Flynn loved &quot;Prison Break&quot; and he thought if he could make millions on top of it, why not! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ 
 7. Anyway as I explained, the LEAD here is &quot;being paid WHILE in WH to SECRETLY advance Turkey agenda&quot;, THAT, my friends, is TREASON. 
 8. Now this gold trader jailed in the US that Flynn may have conspired to free? Faces charges that HE HELPED IRAN SKIRT US SANCTIONS. https://t.co/OMRB2AMwyn 
 9. Mueller is investigating whether Flynn did in fact make this deal with Turkey and received MILLIONS of dollars in secret payments. 
 10. The meeting allegedly took place at 21 Club which is blocks away from Trump tower, where Flynn worked with transition team. 
 11. Flynn was offered upwards of $15 million if he was able to complete the deal. Needless to say, MULTIPLE federal crimes here. https://t.co/DEdOrAXwkK 
 12. Investigators are also looking into what role FLYNN&apos;S SON had in this entire matter. So, multiple charges for the SON, too. https://t.co/40JLj0HGfy 
 13. Guess who is in the DEFENSE team of the gold trader Flynn was conspiring to free? RUDY GIULIANI. It&apos;s ALWAYS a team Trump treason effort. 
 14. Giuliani met with Erdogan in late Feb. to discuss agreement to free the trader in exchange for Turkey&apos;s help furthering US interests in region. https://t.co/lp9E8IOadE 
 15. Erdogan told reporters after the meeting he had raised Zarrab&apos;s case with Biden before and suggested PREET BHARARA was acting on behalf of Gulen supporters. 
 16. This was in late Feb. Guess what happened in MARCH? Preet Bharara was fired. 
 17. It&apos;s obvious the Obama admin didn&apos;t so much as think of listening to a criminal such as Erdogan. The Trump admin instead? Right. 
 18. The TRUMP ADMIN ASKED FBI TO REVIEW THE GULEN CASE ANEW. AND THE FBI DENIED THE REQUEST. So this ISN&apos;T just about Flynn. https://t.co/1vZnhbjLfd 
 19. This is the ENTIRE damn WH trying to aid and abet Erdogan, a CRIMINAL who has people imprisoned, tortured, killed for disagreeing with him. 
 20. And that&apos;s exactly what he wants to do with Gulen, whom he blames for that muppet COUP (who the HELL believes it was real) that happened in Turkey. 
 21. Flynn, once in WH, told Susan Rice to NOT move forward with a plan Obama approved to arm Syrian Kurds in the ISIS fight. 
 22. Why? Because TURKEY opposed that plan. Said plan WAS supposed to continue under Trump admin and WAS approved after Flynn&apos;s firing. 
 23. Flynn stopped the plan several weeks after he held meeting where alleged deal for a &quot;grab free&quot; for Gulen was discussed. 
 24. Once Flynn was fired, the WH approved the plan Obama had made and they had an agreement on, regardless. https://t.co/MGb3PYLY3g 
 25. Not to forget: TRAITOR DEVIN NUNES was allegedly present at a meeting Flynn held with Turkey officials on Jan 18, 2017. 
 26. So involved in this FLYNN gigantic treason mess? Nunes, THE ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE, Giuliani. THIS is why these stories are out. 
 27. They KNOW (Trump, Pence &amp;amp; the rest of their traitor team) they&apos;re ALL involved in Flynn&apos;s dealings and WHEN he&apos;s charged, it&apos;s gonna be BAD. 
 28. But it&apos;s gonna be even worse if it&apos;s announced that he has been charged AND HE COOPERATED in order to save his son. WHICH WE KNOW happened. 
 29. And THIS is why Flynn&apos;s arrest is going to be a HUGE deal. And why news keeps filtering to build up pressure. /END https://t.co/9CbFFOCxdS</texto><total_retweets type="int">1902</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">4483</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">151</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">0</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Surprise</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">54861430</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">70046</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">1968</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">192795</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.1283447339025654</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">False</user_verificado></root>
