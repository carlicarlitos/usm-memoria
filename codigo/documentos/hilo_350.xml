 I have a moment free, let&apos;s read from the new book by @lukeharding1968 ! How about we start with RUSSIA HAS BEEN CULTIVATING TRUMP FOR YEARS. https://t.co/jC9DGjWZmd 
 Meet Christopher Steele. His career is quite a bit more exciting than yours! https://t.co/bNppddzKkZ 
 Cambridge, you say? Source of both spies and double-agent traitors to Russia? Huh. Why does the word &quot;Cambridge&quot; keep popping up...? ðŸ¤” https://t.co/YNCI5fMHi4 
 Steele backstory, skip ahead...AH! Yes. &quot;Russia: Still a whole shit-ton of spies.&quot; https://t.co/UiR24oiquU 
 &quot;Putin...MID-RANKING&quot; ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ–• Also: Steele has been faced off against the FSB a *long* time. https://t.co/GXVpzcnVwb 
 Ah, this makes sense: Data breach, spy identity leaked - Steele had to go private sector. https://t.co/MONaBHLNXS 
 Putin takes power, turns Russia into spyocracy. US behind on HUMINT, Brits ahead as per usual. https://t.co/wweC58UkKq 
 ERRATA: Read too quick - Steele didn&apos;t go private sector, he manned the Russia MI6 desk first. Makes sense. https://t.co/C8upyrmXZz 
 NOW Steele goes private sector - and meets Glenn Simpson. https://t.co/M2xzcXENMd 
 WOW. The FIFA project required someone with simultaneous knowledge of football AND creepy Russian techniques. https://t.co/mvQWcp41bi 
 ONTO TRUMP: Fusion GPS hired by Republicans. https://t.co/BYORFsjyqT 
 Once Trump was the nominee, the intel on Trump was useful to a new political client the Dems. https://t.co/2X6QwzkUPQ 
 Simpson goes to Steele, who looks at new manager Paul Manafort and potential Trump business ties to Russia. https://t.co/HtANZ3tnBs 
 Steele forms a HUMINT network with two and three degrees of separation; more discrete, less verifiable. The information that comes back is nuts. https://t.co/vaAVJyzdCJ 
 TRUMP WAS CULTIVATED AS A KREMLIN ASSET FOR YEARS. GOAL: ATTACK THE WEST. (Does this sound familiar, guys? ðŸ˜Ž) https://t.co/wN7secSgHj 
 BOOM - THE SMOKING GIGANTIC CANNON: - Trump worked with the Kremlin receiving intelligence on political rivals. CONSPIRACY. GOODBYE. - Trump was susceptible to blackmail. KOMPROMAT. https://t.co/sNnL3UzUTv 
 Trump turned down business in exchange for intelligence from the Kremlin. HE AND HIS INNER CIRCLE ARE ALL IN ON IT. https://t.co/dEQt2YuYv8 
 There&apos;s the sex stuff we&apos;ve all heard alleged. But here&apos;s the OTHER kompromat: Trump conspired in the hacking and AMERICANS HELPED PAY FOR IT. https://t.co/vpGJg4XtH0 
 How was Steele so sure? Like any experience HUMINT operative/analyst, he knew that spycraft is as much an art as a science. He used his (very reliable) judgment and had high confidence. https://t.co/8RxwUq6eEH 
 Who and what helped &quot;verify&quot; the Dossier EXACTLY AS I, @20committee, @LouiseMensch and others have been claiming? SIGINT, BABY. SIGINT ALL DAY. https://t.co/7VLHUyV5Yy 
 June 2016: Steele goes to Rome to meet FBI contact. ENTER @COMEY https://t.co/RY186wkyna 
 Steele hoped the FBI would charge in. They were slow. The Clinton email bullshit popped up. Steele went to the US Media to make sure the story got out. https://t.co/K4Y6JtwbwR 
 Intel was floated to both parties, because COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY. Also, it was clear something was weird at FBI, a difference in how they were treating Trump dirt versus Clinton dirt. https://t.co/RlsbWgqGan 
 OCTOBER: Reid, who heard about this intel, asks Comey, &quot;What the hell?&quot; The New York Times declares Trump clean and focuses, like other outlets, On Her Emails. Trump...somehow...wins. https://t.co/cUHVJVSnyV 
 McCain meets Steele. Something is seriously f**ked up, and the people need to know what. https://t.co/BV185vrG86 
 Former BUSH official goes to meet Steele (COUNTRY OVER PARTY) McCain reports to Comey. GAME ON. With not much time left. https://t.co/GEJ8Zb4YGS 
 And now, it&apos;s time to bring in the full US Intelligence Community and an outgoing administration against an incoming traitor. Time was ticking. Tensions were high. And that&apos;s the end of this article. https://t.co/A7fulURxKF 
 Two days later, I wrote a thread now known as &quot;Game Theory.&quot; What do you think? Pretty accurate as history and forecast? Personally, I&apos;m still curious as to how this turns out. It&apos;s quite a story. ðŸ˜Ž &amp;lt;/INTEL&amp;gt;</texto><total_retweets type="int">6812</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">14116</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">368</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">0</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">16912124</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">179530</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">1603</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">81854</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.2494373626610946</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
