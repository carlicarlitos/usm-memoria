 The founder of Apollo, Joshua Harris, was “advising” the Trump team on infrastructure &amp;amp; met MULTIPLE times w/Kush. Harris &amp;amp; Kush discussed a possible WH job for Harris.🤨 2/ #Corruption 
 Harris never got the job, but in November, Apollo lent $184 million to KushCo to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.🙄 Is anyone sensing a pattern here? Failed business guys bailed out by...”connections”.🤔 3/ #TrumpCrimeFamily 
 Kush’s loan was YUGE for Apollo, even as one of the world’s LARGEST private equity firms👉🏼previously UNREPORTED transaction w/KushCo was TRIPLE the size of the average property loan made by Apollo’s real estate lending arm‼️ 4/ 
 Friends, this is TOTAL #corruption. Public service is supposed to be serving the PUBLIC‼️ Instead, it’s pretty clear that Kushner viewed his “job” as SELF-SERVICE.🤬 5/ 
 “There is little precedent for a top White House official meeting with executives of companies as they contemplate sizable loans to his business.” That’s because there is ZERO precedent for a regime as CORRUPT as Trump’s‼️ 6/ 
 Mueller is probing Kush’s interactions w/potential FOREIGN investors. As we know, KushCo BEGGED for investments from #China insurer Anbang &amp;amp; from the former prime minister of Qatar.🤨 7/ 
 Soon after Kush’s potential deal with investors in China &amp;amp; Qatar FELL THROUGH, the Trump regime backed a VERY aggressive move by Saudi Arabia *against* Qatar‼️ Gee, why did this happen⁉️ 8/ #Corruption cc @thespybrief https://t.co/V03ZQKeRxb 
 Kush also met at the WH w/Stephen Schwarzman, of Blackstone, which has lent money to KushCo for several projects before the election. Until August, Schwarzman was the head of a White House business advisory council.🤔 9/ 
 Apollo makes loans indirectly via Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance. One of the largest investors in Apollo’s REIT is the Qatari gov’t’s investment fund, the Qatar Investment Authority👉🏼SAME group that bought ROSNEFT shares AFTER the election‼️ 10/ 
 🔥WHOA🔥 Friends, just reflect for a moment. Kush got SHADY loans for his failing KushCo from the *same* group that help #Russia🇷🇺 “privatize” shares of #Rosneft.😳 NOT coincidence‼️ 11/ https://t.co/OLYl27aggy 
 Shortly after KushCo got its SHADY loan from Apollo, Apollo benefited Trump’s tax cut package.🙄 12/ 
 Recall Kush’s *secret* trips to the Middle East *during* his PERSONAL business negotiations to bail out KushCo⁉️ Why did the US suddenly back Saudi Arabia’s anti-Qatari scheme, just after the Qataris backed out of their deal to BAIL OUT KushCo⁉️ NOT coincidence‼️ 13/ 
 The evidence strongly supports that Kush used his “senior WH staffer” role to influence US foreign policy — including MAJOR Middle East policy — FOR PROFIT‼️🤬 14/ #Corruption #TrumpCrimeFamily 
 Not only did Team🇷🇺Trump sell our country to #Russia, but they also were willing to do ANY deal with ANY COUNTRY for personal gain‼️🤬 Time for these GRIFTERS to GET OUT‼️ /end #FireKushner #TrumpCrimeFamily #ImpeachTrump</texto><total_retweets type="int">5130</total_retweets><total_favoritos type="int">10032</total_favoritos><total_replies type="int">261</total_replies><total_hashtags type="int">8</total_hashtags><emocion_max_1 type="str">Anger</emocion_max_1><emocion_max_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_max_2><emocion_moda_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_moda_1><emocion_moda_2 type="str">Surprise</emocion_moda_2><emocion_media_1 type="str">Joy</emocion_media_1><emocion_media_2 type="str">Fear</emocion_media_2><emocion_presente_1 type="str">Anger</emocion_presente_1><emocion_presente_2 type="str">Joy</emocion_presente_2><usuario type="int">1651522832</usuario><user_total_followers type="int">158938</user_total_followers><user_total_friends type="int">311</user_total_friends><user_total_status type="int">58134</user_total_status><user_puntaje_sigmo type="float">1.4885519046962576</user_puntaje_sigmo><user_verificado type="bool">True</user_verificado></root>
