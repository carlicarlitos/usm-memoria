          'Given the fervor now surrounding it, it\textbackslash{}'s interesting to revisit how "The Star Spangled Banner" became the National Anthem. \textbackslash{}n You\textbackslash{}'d think based on the ferocity on the right, the country was born with that song attached to it (like {\ldots} I dunno {\ldots} slavery). Not true! \textbackslash{}n The Francis Scott Key ditty about a war no one remembers (the war of 1812) did become a popular military jingle after the Civil War. \textbackslash{}n Military bands would play it at events, and it would be played at patriotic picnics etc, but the country still had no national anthem. \textbackslash{}n Then in 1915, the daughter of Woodrow Wilson (Democratic president, unreconstructed racist) recorded the "banner" song and it became a hit. \textbackslash{}n The recording cracked the top ten in sheet music sales in 1915, part of the rah rah toward the end of World War I. https://t.co/BTBAnYfZt9 \textbackslash{}n So like any doting dad, Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order making his daughter\textbackslash{}'s hit song the national anthem. https://t.co/3tO2YWk3DM \textbackslash{}n He could have picked any other song: "My Country Tis of Thee" was also popular at the time. But he liked his daughter\textbackslash{}'s hit song the best. \textbackslash{}n Probably didn\textbackslash{}'t hurt that the Francis Scott Key song was pro-slavery, given Wilson\textbackslash{}'s venal racial views {\ldots} https://t.co/sEzzJxZcV4 \textbackslash{}n Anyhoo, congress pretty much ignored Wilson\textbackslash{}'s order, and the anthem remained informal until 1931, when a law was passed codifying it. \textbackslash{}n That law was signed by a guy named Herbert Hoover, who probably saw it as a feel good headline to replace ones like\textbackslash{}x85 https://t.co/vtQmOTxeyY \textbackslash{}n The bill to make "The Star Spangled Banner" the national anthem was introduced by a Maryland congressman (total coincidence, the song refers \textbackslash{}n to took place off Baltimore Harbor. And there was LOTS of pushback, esp since the tune was an old drinking song. https://t.co/GpLpvSsDF9 \textbackslash{}n And it was considered too hard for the average person to sing -- too many octaves. \textbackslash{}n People also thought there were better options, like "America the Beautiful" and other popular patriotic songs: https://t.co/V5F5PZeFFJ \textbackslash{}n And that debate didn\textbackslash{}'t end before or after it was designated. https://t.co/2TmsNE4M2P \textbackslash{}n In other words far from revering it, Americans kept arguing over whether there even should be a national song, and if this was the best one. \textbackslash{}n Personally I could make a very strong case for "America the Beautiful," which is a prettier song, and more inclusive, but I\textbackslash{}'m just on TV{\ldots} \textbackslash{}n Bottom line: people act like that song was handed down by God, or by the military. It wasn\textbackslash{}'t. It was decreed by a POTUS hyping his daughter. \textbackslash{}n Meanwhile, it had absolutely NOTHING to do with professional football, which began with the creation of the NFL {\ldots} in 1920. \textbackslash{}n IOW, 13 years before that song was the national anthem.',

          'THREAD. I see a lot of people asking how people who can\textbackslash{}'t legally purchase guns end up with them. The answer is complex, but important. \textbackslash{}n 2. Let\textbackslash{}'s start with the law. Federal law prohibits people who fall under 11 listed criteria from purchasing a gun. \textbackslash{}n 3. This includes convictions for domestic violence, narcotics, or legal adjudication of mental illness (among others) \textbackslash{}n 4. Federal law also requires a background check for anyone purchasing a gun at a federally licensed firearms dealer. \textbackslash{}n 5. The federal database against which background checks are conducted is called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) \textbackslash{}n 6. However, many of the disqualifying criteria, like domestic violence or drugs or mental illness, fall under state law \textbackslash{}n 7. This means that NICS is only as effective as the information that states (or the military) provide to it, for inclusion in the database \textbackslash{}n 8. In many instances, this information fails to make it into NICS. The VA Tech shooter had a mental health adjudication -- wasn\textbackslash{}'t in NICS \textbackslash{}n 9. Dylan Roof, who also shot people worshipping in a church, had a narcotics conviction -- not in NICS \textbackslash{}n 10. So why not just search state records? Well, a S. Ct. case called Printz v. U.S. ruled that the feds can\textbackslash{}'t force state LEOs \textbackslash{}n 11. to conduct state background checks. (If they did, most of this would come up.) Rather, states have to "volunteer" to do this. \textbackslash{}n 12. Currently, only 13 states "volunteer" to do this for all firearms. Three do it only for handguns. And three do it only for permits. \textbackslash{}n 13. So there is Leak \#1. In addition, the fed background check only applies to federally licensed dealers, not to private transfers \textbackslash{}n 14. Only nine states require background checks at the point of transfer from any dealer: CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, NY, NV, OR, RI, WA \textbackslash{}n 15. Some others require it only for handguns, or for permits. So there you have Leak \#2. Basically the "secondary market" is wide open. \textbackslash{}n 16. Here\textbackslash{}'s where stolen guns come into the picture. Fed law does not require the reporting of stolen firearms. Only 9 states do for all guns \textbackslash{}n 17. So there\textbackslash{}'s Leak \#3. This allows straw purchasers -- legal gun buyers -- to buy guns and "accidentally" lose them, and never report it. \textbackslash{}n 18. Not only are the vast majority of guns used in crime stolen (not used by the legal owner), but they can be traced back to 1\% of dealers \textbackslash{}n 19. But -- get this -- feds not allowed to say who they are because of a 2003 law preventing it. \textbackslash{}n 20. And, FWIW, some states disproportionately contribute to the stolen gun pipeline (from 13-18\% more than the lowest contributing states) \textbackslash{}n 21. So that\textbackslash{}'s just a broad outline of how \$\#\&amp;@ up our regulatory system is. Bottom line: If you want a gun, there\textbackslash{}'s a way to get one.',

          '1/ I feel a little better about Bernie\textbackslash{}'s CNN stunt now that McCain is a no but to be clear this is a terrible situation for Democrats \textbackslash{}n 2/ A Jim Comey level of terrible. I refer you to the first 45 minutes of Morning Joe yesterday. You can watch it on demand. \textbackslash{}n 3/ And it\textbackslash{}'s more than my usual "why is Bernie speaking for Democrats" primal scream \textbackslash{}n 4/ Bc now instead of discussing what\textbackslash{}x92s wrong with Graham Cassidy, convo shifts to why it\textbackslash{}x92s at least better than "Berniecare" \textbackslash{}n 5/ It should be Conyers-care but this is Bernie we\textbackslash{}'re talking about, so Bernie-care it shall be, and that means "socialism" \textbackslash{}n 6/ I\textbackslash{}x92m going to get flamed about how it isn\textbackslash{}x92t socialism but calm down, I know this and I agree with you, but that\textbackslash{}x92s not the point \textbackslash{}n 7/ To the GOP, Obamacare is socialism, even without public option, so m4a is unfathomable to them. \textbackslash{}n 8/ Yes, calling it socialism is a scare tactic, but it\textbackslash{}'s a scare tactic that works. Might as well say communism. Many have. \textbackslash{}n 9/ Some ask, why would Collins and Murkowski be swayed by Bernie and you\textbackslash{}x92re right, they wouldn\textbackslash{}x92t. The issue is framing. \textbackslash{}n 10/ When they start polling m4a vs Graham-Cassidy instead of ACA vs Graham-Cassidy and the GC numbers increase{\ldots} \textbackslash{}n 11/ If \&amp; when support reaches critical mass in their states, Murkowski and Collins will have no choice but to vote for repeal. \textbackslash{}n 12/ GOP only has until the 30th to repeal ACA under reconciliation. After that it takes 60 votes. They def don\textbackslash{}x92t have 60 votes \textbackslash{}n 13/ But they might have 50, which is why the timing is problematic. And suspicious. Why not wait one week? \textbackslash{}n 14/ This is also a problem for m4A, if you want that to succeed. This \textbackslash{}x93debate\textbackslash{}x94 will allow Graham to savage m4A as introduced. \textbackslash{}n 15/ m4a that everyone signed onto isn\textbackslash{}'t really legislation, it\textbackslash{}x92s an outline. There\textbackslash{}x92s no funding mechanism. It hasn\textbackslash{}'t even been scored. \textbackslash{}n 16/ Even if McConnell wanted to hold hearings tomorrow a completely new bill would have to be drafted. \textbackslash{}n 17/ So when Bernie goes in bumper sticker slogans, no funding mechanism, no CBO score, Graham will eviscerate him \textbackslash{}n 18/ He\textbackslash{}x92ll have an independent score and a takedown of the most unappetizing funder they can dream up \textbackslash{}n 19/ He\textbackslash{}'ll arguing worst case scenario strawmen and terrifying projections, tax implications, shortages, and worse. \textbackslash{}n 20/ Since our side has nothing, charges will be impossible to refute, and will be on record for 2018 political ads against Dems \textbackslash{}n 21/ Once Graham exposes its flaws, the bill it will be DOA no matter what happens with ACA, and we\textbackslash{}x92ll have to start over \textbackslash{}n 22/ As I said, we\textbackslash{}x92d have to start over anyway, but this will bring that \textbackslash{}x93momemtum\textbackslash{}x94 Berners like to crow about to a screeching halt. \textbackslash{}n 23/ So to recap, this debate is bad for Democrats in 2018, bad for the future of m4a, bad for everything except what? \textbackslash{}n 24/ *all together now* Feeding Bernie\textbackslash{}x92s ego \textbackslash{}n 25/ All we\textbackslash{}'re asking for is 7 days. Think about it. /end',

it wasn\textbackslash{}'t his idea. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: MANY Trump campaign aides AND NatSec team members knew Page was going to Russia post-hacking revelations\textbackslash{}x97none tried to stop him. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page bypassed top policy aides and NatSec peers in telling HOPE HICKS he was going to Russia\textbackslash{}x97suggesting he wanted TRUMP to know. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Given Page and JD Gordon\textbackslash{}'s words, Hicks LIED to the media in saying the campaign had no Russia contacts; she\textbackslash{}'s a key witness now. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page spoke to the FBI 5-6 times in 2016-7; if he told them what he told Congress, he can be charged with Making False Statements. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page deliberately withheld deeply inculpatory documents from Congress using a false and legally fraudulent Fifth Amendment claim. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page met the same Kremlin official and Rosneft exec in BOTH July and December 2016 and lied about BOTH interactions to Congress. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: On July 7, 2016, the Kremlin asked Page to carry a message to Trump: we strongly support you and want to work with you on policy. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page admits discussing sanctions policy with both the Kremlin and Rosneft in July; after, he briefed the campaign on these talks. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: As Page briefed the NatSec team and the campaign on his secret Russia meetings, every Trump aide who denied Russia contacts lied. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page was certain to keep Trump\textbackslash{}'s daily assistant, Hope Hicks, in the loop\textbackslash{}x97Sessions, too\textbackslash{}x97so Trump and Sessions knew what Page did. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: As of mid-July, Trump\textbackslash{}'s campaign was *on notice* Russia supported it, wanted to help it, and was offering "outreach"\textbackslash{}x97cooperation. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: When Trump said "Russia, if you\textbackslash{}'re listening{\ldots}" and asked it to release Clinton emails, he was *responding* to Russian outreach. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page *directly* revealed his Moscow plans to Sessions at an event Sessions set up\textbackslash{}x97didn\textbackslash{}'t disclose\textbackslash{}x97and sat beside Papadopoulos at. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page admits "the whole [NatSec] group" got Papadopoulos\textbackslash{}' March 2016 email on the Kremlin wanting to meet\textbackslash{}x97that\textbackslash{}'d include Sessions. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page proposed the campaign tell him what to say in Moscow\textbackslash{}x97thus, *to Kremlin agents*\textbackslash{}x97and/or have Trump take the trip in his place. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Everything the Steele Dossier said about Page appears to be either exactly accurate or so close to it as to be indistinguishable. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: During his July \textbackslash{}'16 trip Page discussed the upcoming sale of Rosneft with Rosneft\textbackslash{}'s Investor Relations chief\textbackslash{}x97a key dossier claim. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: AFTER we knew of Russia hacking\textbackslash{}x97but BEFORE Trump changed the GOP platform to benefit Putin\textbackslash{}x97Page told Clovis Russia favored Trump. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team talked lifting sanctions on Russia\textbackslash{}x97maybe unilaterally\textbackslash{}x97from its earliest days, *right after* the Mayflower Speech. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team knew Page was headed to Moscow as a "private citizen" concurrent to discussing sending a "private citizen" there. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Multiple NatSec team members (at least 3) went to Budapest, the European HQ for Russian intelligence; Page met "a Russian" there. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: At least 7 of the NatSec team\textbackslash{}'s 14 members were on an email about the GOP platform change\textbackslash{}x97and at least TEN campaign members knew. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: None of the NINE campaign members who *knew* Manafort was lying about Trump\textbackslash{}'s role in the GOP platform change revealed the truth. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST ten members of the campaign and the NatSec team knew they were helping Putin at a time the Kremlin was supporting Trump. \textbackslash{}n BOMBSHELL: Page met Kremlin/Rosneft officials in Moscow in December \textbackslash{}'16\textbackslash{}x97including contact with the MANAGER of Putin\textbackslash{}'s election interference. \textbackslash{}n CONCLUSION: These 28 bombshells are what we learned simply from DECEITFUL Congressional testimony.

          '(1) Some things that changed when I went from SJW atheist to Trumplican atheist: \textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nI stopped bashing \#PrayForTexas\textbackslash{}x85 https://t.co/Ryn46AxiCI \textbackslash{}n (2) When I was an SJW I used to say "you pray for [insert location] so you can virtue signal while doing nothing practical." This is a lie.. \textbackslash{}n (3) SJW atheists assume they know others\textbackslash{}' motives. Once I started respecting people enough to consider THEIR beliefs \&amp; actions, I changed. \textbackslash{}n (4) When people of faith encourage others to pray for others it\textbackslash{}'s bc often there is nothing they can do directly. They\textbackslash{}'re not there. Also{\ldots} \textbackslash{}n (5) When a person of faith hears that someone is praying for them, it usually brings them comfort. Yet SJW atheists dismiss that effect. \textbackslash{}n (6) The Left calls Trumplicans "lacking in empathy" yet a solid case can be made for THEM lacking in empathy. Esp the SJW atheists. \textbackslash{}n (7) What greater empathy can there be than to seek help from the Creator, on behalf of someone else, in a way that brings comfort. \textbackslash{}n (8) Here\textbackslash{}'s a saying that triggers SJW atheists incredibly: "There are no atheists in foxholes." \textbackslash{}n (9) Perhaps the meaning of "There are no atheists in foxholes" might be: When the SHTF, human nature is to seek higher meaning. \textbackslash{}n (10) I can guarantee you, many SJW atheists feel extremely uncomfortable when you question whether their atheism would survive a foxhole. \textbackslash{}n (11) For SJW atheists, their lack of belief hasn\textbackslash{}'t been subjected to mature, logical scrutiny. For a conservative atheist, often it has. \textbackslash{}n (12) It takes mental and moral courage to really examine your beliefs or lack of beliefs. SJWs, by definition, have undeveloped beliefs. \textbackslash{}n (13) There is no such thing as social, economic, environmental or reproductive justice. There is only justice{\ldots} which is often elusive. \textbackslash{}n (14) SJWs define justice in childlike terms. Justice is whatever makes them happy at the time. Bradley Manning is a great example. \textbackslash{}n (15) To Bradley Manning, "exposing" what he believes are "war crimes" justifies giving sensitive intel to our enemies. Manning is not God. \textbackslash{}n (16) Military men and women with more intellect, training and lawful responsibility determined that the intel must be kept secret. \textbackslash{}n (17) It\textbackslash{}'s not for Manning or any other misinformed SJW to determine what intel should be kept secret. He swore an oath to follow orders. \textbackslash{}n (18) But to an SJW, even military authority is open to question. Manning believes his sense of "justice" supersedes lawful authority. \textbackslash{}n (19) Even Christian SJWs believe they can supersede lawful authority. Despite the New Testament\textbackslash{}'s clarity on the matter. This is bc \textbackslash{}n (20) Christian SJWs are moral relativists. And don\textbackslash{}'t say "they\textbackslash{}'re not real Christians" either bc as I was taught, that\textbackslash{}'s not for us to judge \textbackslash{}n (20) Moral relativism is a scourge on humanity. Atheism makes it more likely in a person but anyone can do it if they are a sloppy thinker. \textbackslash{}n (21) None of this fascinating discussion is possible with SJW atheists, though. They are fundamentalists like those they criticize. \textbackslash{}n (22) People have to come to a place of insight themselves, pushing them only drives them away. Many SJWs have eventually seen the light. \textbackslash{}n (23) I just see it as my "calling", if you like, to work for our side, mature people with empathy who use logic and evidence. \textbackslash{}n (24) I hope that by sharing my story of transformation from SJW to conservative you will be encouraged that there is always hope. \textbackslash{}n (25) Prayer does work. It brings comfort, fellowship \&amp; hope to the hurting. Something "social justice" can never do. \#PrayForTexas \textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nEND',

          'The new Republican talking point\textbackslash{}x97radio, TV, White House\textbackslash{}x97is any critique of conservative public policy is an attempt to "divide the country." \textbackslash{}n 2/ Let\textbackslash{}'s be clear: the motto of The New Fascism is, "Don\textbackslash{}'t divide the country." It\textbackslash{}'s a way to intimidate dissenters and *end* public debate. \textbackslash{}n 3/ Have a problem with the current debate surrounding police brutality? *Engage the debate*. Only a fascist says "Don\textbackslash{}'t divide the country." \textbackslash{}n 4/ Trump voters laud his candor, but his "Don\textbackslash{}'t divide the country!" rhetoric masks a cowardly unwillingness to say what he really believes. \textbackslash{}n 5/ And what does Trump really think? That the NFL should\textbackslash{}'ve given him a team and he doesn\textbackslash{}'t give a *damn* about police brutality either way. \textbackslash{}n 6/ We\textbackslash{}'ve been hearing "Don\textbackslash{}'t divide the country!" from Rush Limbaugh, from Donald Trump, from Paul Ryan, from Republicans across the board. \textbackslash{}n 7/ We started hearing this New Fascist slogan well before Colin Kaepernick took a knee. The far right uses it on *all* controversial issues. \textbackslash{}n 8/ It\textbackslash{}'s an Orwellian way of seeming to support unity while aggressively preventing the open dialogue that allows a lasting unity to develop. \textbackslash{}n 9/ If Donald Trump weren\textbackslash{}'t a coward, he\textbackslash{}'d have Huckabee Sanders just come out and *say* Trump thinks there\textbackslash{}'s no police brutality in America. \textbackslash{}n 10/ Of course, saying what you think allows a debate to unfold. Opting for pure rhetoric instead is a fascistic technique\textbackslash{}x97and has long been. \textbackslash{}n 11/ The best part? Trump\textbackslash{}'s base has *long* had, as its animating issue, the notion that the New Left is squashing public debate and dissent. \textbackslash{}n 12/ There may well be elements of the New Left that use such tactics. But they use them less often\textbackslash{}x97and less successfully\textbackslash{}x97than Donald Trump. \textbackslash{}n 13/ The perverse paradox of Trump is, he wants to be loved but if he ever said what he really thinks he\textbackslash{}'d discover America isn\textbackslash{}'t behind him. \textbackslash{}n 14/ America *doesn\textbackslash{}'t* support him not caring about policy\textbackslash{}x97it *doesn\textbackslash{}'t* support him using the flag as cover for his vendetta against the NFL. \textbackslash{}n 15/ It *doesn\textbackslash{}'t* support him using "tax reform" as a cover to enrich himself as he does virtually nothing at all for middle-class taxpayers. \textbackslash{}n 16/ To be honest, I don\textbackslash{}'t think his base even supports him avoiding the police brutality issue using cowardly, empty nationalistic rhetoric. \textbackslash{}n 17/ The Trump voters I come across online are angry\textbackslash{}x97they *want* to debate police brutality, not spout a "Don\textbackslash{}'t divide the country!" bromide. \textbackslash{}n 18/ That\textbackslash{}'s why I call this "The New Fascism": what lies behind it is a fear the far-right position isn\textbackslash{}'t strong enough to withstand debate. \textbackslash{}n 19/ Trump wraps himself in the flag as a way to hide his personal motives but *also* his unwillingness to debate the police brutality issue. \textbackslash{}n 20/ I think both Left *and* Right should reject the falseness and cowardice of Trump\textbackslash{}'s "New Fascism" and just debate the issues at hand now. \textbackslash{}n 21/ When I hear\textbackslash{}x97say\textbackslash{}x97Limbaugh replace *zero* facility with the facts of the police brutality debate with empty rhetoric, it\textbackslash{}'s just grotesque. \textbackslash{}n 22/ It also suggests that the Right has *no* response to many Americans\textbackslash{}' concerns about police brutality, and *that* should anger the Right. \textbackslash{}n 23/ "Class warfare"; "dividing the country"; "election butt-hurt"\textbackslash{}x97one side of our national political discourse collapsed into lame bromides. \textbackslash{}n 24/ Anyone who\textbackslash{}'s upset about "PC culture" destroying public debate should be *equally* upset about empty rhetoric destroying the same thing. \textbackslash{}n 25/ If you love the flag and think it\textbackslash{}'s being disrespected, defend that view with *studied positions on police brutality*\textbackslash{}x97not fascistic pap. \textbackslash{}n PS/ Actually no, because Trump has yet to take *any* position on police brutality\textbackslash{}x97which is what we\textbackslash{}'re talking about. https://t.co/Cu3D0PbcMe \textbackslash{}n PS2/ Unless, of course, you count him telling a large gathering of police officers that they should definitely brutalize all their suspects. \textbackslash{}n PS3/ Afterwards he said, clearly falsely, that it was a joke\textbackslash{}x97further proof he doesn\textbackslash{}'t have the courage of his personal/political conviction.',
