      "(THREAD) This thread lists EVERY bombshell in Carter Page's Congressional testimonyÂeach summarized in ONE sentenceÂ",
      " https://t.co/axVlG8xYPk \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: The White House lied repeatedly about how active Trump's secretive NatSec Advisory Committee wasÂit met MANY times, not \"once.\" \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Kremlin agents lured Page to Russia to meet Kremlin officials and Rosneft execs AFTER he joined the campaign; it wasn't his idea. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: MANY Trump campaign aides AND NatSec team members knew Page was going to Russia post-hacking revelationsÂnone tried to stop him. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page bypassed top policy aides and NatSec peers in telling HOPE HICKS he was going to RussiaÂsuggesting he wanted TRUMP to know. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Given Page and JD Gordon's words, Hicks LIED to the media in saying the campaign had no Russia contacts; she's a key witness now. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page spoke to the FBI 5-6 times in 2016-7; if he told them what he told Congress, he can be charged with Making False Statements. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page deliberately withheld deeply inculpatory documents from Congress using a false and legally fraudulent Fifth Amendment claim. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page met the same Kremlin official and Rosneft exec in BOTH July and December 2016 and lied about BOTH interactions to Congress. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: On July 7, 2016, the Kremlin asked Page to carry a message to Trump: we strongly support you and want to work with you on policy. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page admits discussing sanctions policy with both the Kremlin and Rosneft in July; after, he briefed the campaign on these talks. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: As Page briefed the NatSec team and the campaign on his secret Russia meetings, every Trump aide who denied Russia contacts lied. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page was certain to keep Trump's daily assistant, Hope Hicks, in the loopÂSessions, tooÂso Trump and Sessions knew what Page did. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: As of mid-July, Trump's campaign was *on notice* Russia supported it, wanted to help it, and was offering \"outreach\"Âcooperation. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: When Trump said \"Russia, if you're listening...\" and asked it to release Clinton emails, he was *responding* to Russian outreach. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page *directly* revealed his Moscow plans to Sessions at an event Sessions set upÂdidn't discloseÂand sat beside Papadopoulos at. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page admits \"the whole [NatSec] group\" got Papadopoulos' March 2016 email on the Kremlin wanting to meetÂthat'd include Sessions. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page proposed the campaign tell him what to say in MoscowÂthus, *to Kremlin agents*Âand/or have Trump take the trip in his place. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Everything the Steele Dossier said about Page appears to be either exactly accurate or so close to it as to be indistinguishable. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: During his July '16 trip Page discussed the upcoming sale of Rosneft with Rosneft's Investor Relations chiefÂa key dossier claim. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: AFTER we knew of Russia hackingÂbut BEFORE Trump changed the GOP platform to benefit PutinÂPage told Clovis Russia favored Trump. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team talked lifting sanctions on RussiaÂmaybe unilaterallyÂfrom its earliest days, *right after* the Mayflower Speech. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team knew Page was headed to Moscow as a \"private citizen\" concurrent to discussing sending a \"private citizen\" there. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Multiple NatSec team members (at least 3) went to Budapest, the European HQ for Russian intelligence; Page met \"a Russian\" there. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: At least 7 of the NatSec team's 14 members were on an email about the GOP platform changeÂand at least TEN campaign members knew. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: None of the NINE campaign members who *knew* Manafort was lying about Trump's role in the GOP platform change revealed the truth. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST ten members of the campaign and the NatSec team knew they were helping Putin at a time the Kremlin was supporting Trump. \n",
      " BOMBSHELL: Page met Kremlin/Rosneft officials in Moscow in December '16Âincluding contact with the MANAGER of Putin's election interference. \n",
      " CONCLUSION: These 28 bombshells are what we learned simply from DECEITFUL Congressional testimony. So just IMAGINE what MUELLER knows. {end}\n"

      " (7) What greater empathy can there be than to seek help from the Creator, on behalf of someone else, in a way that brings comfort. \n",

      " (12) It takes mental and moral courage to really examine your beliefs or lack of beliefs. SJWs, by definition, have undeveloped beliefs. \n",
      " (13) There is no such thing as social, economic, environmental or reproductive justice. There is only justice... which is often elusive. \n",

      "The new Republican talking pointÂradio, TV, White HouseÂis any critique of conservative public policy is an attempt to \"divide the country.\" \n",
      " 2/ Let's be clear: the motto of The New Fascism is, \"Don't divide the country.\" It's a way to intimidate dissenters and *end* public debate. \n",
      " 3/ Have a problem with the current debate surrounding police brutality? *Engage the debate*. Only a fascist says \"Don't divide the country.\" \n",
      " 4/ Trump voters laud his candor, but his \"Don't divide the country!\" rhetoric masks a cowardly unwillingness to say what he really believes. \n",
      " 5/ And what does Trump really think? That the NFL should've given him a team and he doesn't give a *damn* about police brutality either way. \n",
      " 6/ We've been hearing \"Don't divide the country!\" from Rush Limbaugh, from Donald Trump, from Paul Ryan, from Republicans across the board. \n",
      " 7/ We started hearing this New Fascist slogan well before Colin Kaepernick took a knee. The far right uses it on *all* controversial issues. \n",
      " 8/ It's an Orwellian way of seeming to support unity while aggressively preventing the open dialogue that allows a lasting unity to develop. \n",
      " 9/ If Donald Trump weren't a coward, he'd have Huckabee Sanders just come out and *say* Trump thinks there's no police brutality in America. \n",
      " 10/ Of course, saying what you think allows a debate to unfold. Opting for pure rhetoric instead is a fascistic techniqueÂand has long been. \n",
      " 11/ The best part? Trump's base has *long* had, as its animating issue, the notion that the New Left is squashing public debate and dissent. \n",
      " 12/ There may well be elements of the New Left that use such tactics. But they use them less oftenÂand less successfullyÂthan Donald Trump. \n",

      " 15/ It *doesn't* support him using \"tax reform\" as a cover to enrich himself as he does virtually nothing at all for middle-class taxpayers. \n",
      " 16/ To be honest, I don't think his base even supports him avoiding the police brutality issue using cowardly, empty nationalistic rhetoric. \n",
      " 17/ The Trump voters I come across online are angryÂthey *want* to debate police brutality, not spout a \"Don't divide the country!\" bromide. \n",
      " 18/ That's why I call this \"The New Fascism\": what lies behind it is a fear the far-right position isn't strong enough to withstand debate. \n",
      " 19/ Trump wraps himself in the flag as a way to hide his personal motives but *also* his unwillingness to debate the police brutality issue. \n",
      " 20/ I think both Left *and* Right should reject the falseness and cowardice of Trump's \"New Fascism\" and just debate the issues at hand now. \n",
      " 21/ When I hearÂsayÂLimbaugh replace *zero* facility with the facts of the police brutality debate with empty rhetoric, it's just grotesque. \n",
      " 22/ It also suggests that the Right has *no* response to many Americans' concerns about police brutality, and *that* should anger the Right. \n",
      " 23/ \"Class warfare\"; \"dividing the country\"; \"election butt-hurt\"Âone side of our national political discourse collapsed into lame bromides. \n",
      " 24/ Anyone who's upset about \"PC culture\" destroying public debate should be *equally* upset about empty rhetoric destroying the same thing. \n",
      " 25/ If you love the flag and think it's being disrespected, defend that view with *studied positions on police brutality*Ânot fascistic pap. \n",
      " PS/ Actually no, because Trump has yet to take *any* position on police brutalityÂwhich is what we're talking about. https://t.co/Cu3D0PbcMe \n",
      " PS2/ Unless, of course, you count him telling a large gathering of police officers that they should definitely brutalize all their suspects. \n",
      " PS3/ Afterwards he said, clearly falsely, that it was a jokeÂfurther proof he doesn't have the courage of his personal/political conviction.\n"
