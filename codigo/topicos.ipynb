      "(1) Some things that changed when I went from SJW atheist to Trumplican atheist: \n",
      "\n",
      "I stopped bashing #PrayForTexas",
      " https://t.co/Ryn46AxiCI \n",
      " (2) When I was an SJW I used to say \"you pray for [insert location] so you can virtue signal while doing nothing practical.\" This is a lie.. \n",
      " (3) SJW atheists assume they know others' motives. Once I started respecting people enough to consider THEIR beliefs &amp; actions, I changed. \n",
      " (4) When people of faith encourage others to pray for others it's bc often there is nothing they can do directly. They're not there. Also... \n",
      " (5) When a person of faith hears that someone is praying for them, it usually brings them comfort. Yet SJW atheists dismiss that effect. \n",
      " (6) The Left calls Trumplicans \"lacking in empathy\" yet a solid case can be made for THEM lacking in empathy. Esp the SJW atheists. \n",
      " (7) What greater empathy can there be than to seek help from the Creator, on behalf of someone else, in a way that brings comfort. \n",
      " (8) Here's a saying that triggers SJW atheists incredibly: \"There are no atheists in foxholes.\" \n",
      " (9) Perhaps the meaning of \"There are no atheists in foxholes\" might be: When the SHTF, human nature is to seek higher meaning. \n",
      " (10) I can guarantee you, many SJW atheists feel extremely uncomfortable when you question whether their atheism would survive a foxhole. \n",
      " (11) For SJW atheists, their lack of belief hasn't been subjected to mature, logical scrutiny. For a conservative atheist, often it has. \n",
      " (12) It takes mental and moral courage to really examine your beliefs or lack of beliefs. SJWs, by definition, have undeveloped beliefs. \n",
      " (13) There is no such thing as social, economic, environmental or reproductive justice. There is only justice... which is often elusive. \n",
      " (14) SJWs define justice in childlike terms. Justice is whatever makes them happy at the time. Bradley Manning is a great example. \n",
      " (15) To Bradley Manning, \"exposing\" what he believes are \"war crimes\" justifies giving sensitive intel to our enemies. Manning is not God. \n",
      " (16) Military men and women with more intellect, training and lawful responsibility determined that the intel must be kept secret. \n",
      " (17) It's not for Manning or any other misinformed SJW to determine what intel should be kept secret. He swore an oath to follow orders. \n",
      " (18) But to an SJW, even military authority is open to question. Manning believes his sense of \"justice\" supersedes lawful authority. \n",
      " (19) Even Christian SJWs believe they can supersede lawful authority. Despite the New Testament's clarity on the matter. This is bc \n",
      " (20) Christian SJWs are moral relativists. And don't say \"they're not real Christians\" either bc as I was taught, that's not for us to judge \n",
      " (20) Moral relativism is a scourge on humanity. Atheism makes it more likely in a person but anyone can do it if they are a sloppy thinker. \n",
      " (21) None of this fascinating discussion is possible with SJW atheists, though. They are fundamentalists like those they criticize. \n",
      " (22) People have to come to a place of insight themselves, pushing them only drives them away. Many SJWs have eventually seen the light. \n",
      " (23) I just see it as my \"calling\", if you like, to work for our side, mature people with empathy who use logic and evidence. \n",
      " (24) I hope that by sharing my story of transformation from SJW to conservative you will be encouraged that there is always hope. \n",
      " (25) Prayer does work. It brings comfort, fellowship &amp; hope to the hurting. Something \"social justice\" can never do. #PrayForTexas \n",

      "The new Republican talking pointradio, TV, White Houseis any critique of conservative public policy is an attempt to \"divide the country.\" \n",
      " 2/ Let's be clear: the motto of The New Fascism is, \"Don't divide the country.\" It's a way to intimidate dissenters and *end* public debate. \n",
      " 3/ Have a problem with the current debate surrounding police brutality? *Engage the debate*. Only a fascist says \"Don't divide the country.\" \n",
      " 4/ Trump voters laud his candor, but his \"Don't divide the country!\" rhetoric masks a cowardly unwillingness to say what he really believes. \n",
      " 5/ And what does Trump really think? That the NFL should've given him a team and he doesn't give a *damn* about police brutality either way. \n",
      " 6/ We've been hearing \"Don't divide the country!\" from Rush Limbaugh, from Donald Trump, from Paul Ryan, from Republicans across the board. \n",
      " 7/ We started hearing this New Fascist slogan well before Colin Kaepernick took a knee. The far right uses it on *all* controversial issues. \n",

      " 12/ There may well be elements of the New Left that use such tactics. But they use them less oftenand less successfullythan Donald Trump. \n",
      " 13/ The perverse paradox of Trump is, he wants to be loved but if he ever said what he really thinks he'd discover America isn't behind him. \n",

      " 16/ To be honest, I don't think his base even supports him avoiding the police brutality issue using cowardly, empty nationalistic rhetoric. \n",
      " 17/ The Trump voters I come across online are angrythey *want* to debate police brutality, not spout a \"Don't divide the country!\" bromide. \n",
      " 18/ That's why I call this \"The New Fascism\": what lies behind it is a fear the far-right position isn't strong enough to withstand debate. \n",
      " 19/ Trump wraps himself in the flag as a way to hide his personal motives but *also* his unwillingness to debate the police brutality issue. \n",
      " 20/ I think both Left *and* Right should reject the falseness and cowardice of Trump's \"New Fascism\" and just debate the issues at hand now. \n",
      " 21/ When I hearsayLimbaugh replace *zero* facility with the facts of the police brutality debate with empty rhetoric, it's just grotesque. \n",
      " 22/ It also suggests that the Right has *no* response to many Americans' concerns about police brutality, and *that* should anger the Right. \n",
      " 23/ \"Class warfare\"; \"dividing the country\"; \"election butt-hurt\"one side of our national political discourse collapsed into lame bromides. \n",
      " 24/ Anyone who's upset about \"PC culture\" destroying public debate should be *equally* upset about empty rhetoric destroying the same thing. \n",
      " 25/ If you love the flag and think it's being disrespected, defend that view with *studied positions on police brutality*not fascistic pap. \n",
