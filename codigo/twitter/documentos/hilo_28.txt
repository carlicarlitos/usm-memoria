Thread. Few things about the Ryan Seacrest situation. First, here @Variety reporter @gdanielholloway's first story on the years of alleged abuse RS subjected a woman to. She told her story using her name. Her job ended after she reported him to HR in 2013 https://t.co/KSdYqV5cBF 
 Second: This is for people saying "But it was investigated and nothing was found." Incorrect. Two important facts: 1. His employer hired another firm to do the investigation. Not a truly independent third party. Investigator's payment came from E!, where Seacrest is a big deal. 
 As for firm that did the Seacrest investigation: Their finding was “insufficient evidence” of wrongdoing. Whatever that means. As for corroboration, @gdanielholloway talked to many other sources &amp; another employee told NBC he witnessed alleged abuse https://t.co/XWMNkGqwzs 
 As @soniasaraiya wrote in a must-read opinion column, E! put together an "investigation that has no mandate or incentive to be impartial." Yes, I agree, due process matters. But so far all the survivor got was E's HR inquiry &amp; an inquiry by a firm *they* hired. 
 Ryan Seacrest has many platforms from which to defend himself &amp; give his side (incl to Variety). He has said he was asked for money. As @gdanielholloway story notes, "Seacrest’s reps provided no evidence to Variety that such a monetary request was made." https://t.co/XWMNkGqwzs 
 Speaking generally, not about any individual, as as for the defense that "I just don't believe this person could do that because of X or Y," know that anyone is capable of abuse and harassment. It's about power, full stop. 
 Will link to @soniasaraiya's column again: "He’s deliberately and repeatedly attacking the character of his accuser." This is why many were demoralized that E! put Seacrest on the red carpet. My respect for anyone who talked to him today has declined https://t.co/1ZSMUivk6i 
 Finally, for those saying, "How dare this mob angrily demanding he lose 1 or 2 of his 87 jobs!" Huhwut? Not Topic A, that I've seen. A debate worth having, sure. Regardless, it's *extremely* questionable he is a core public face of @enews today. Disrespectful to #MeToo imho. Fin. 
 If you're in my mentions trying to start an argument with me, I'm not looking at them tonight. Whatever I wanted to say was in this thread. Enjoy your evening. https://t.co/LxKzstce4m
