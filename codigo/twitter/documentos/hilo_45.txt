If the president vetoes a bill, it is sent back to Congress with a message from the president explaining the reasons for his veto. Congress then has two choices: /1 #FridayFeeling #FridayMotivation #Trump2020 #Trump #MAGA #KAG https://t.co/dfbrLPgxV7 
 1. They can do nothing, and the bill dies. 2. They can vote to override the veto. If 2/3 of each house vote to override the veto, it becomes a law without the president's approval. If they fail to get a 2/3 vote in either house of Congress, the bill dies. /2 #winning #KAG https://t.co/2bAWSJ4u6c 
 The House passed with 256-167, 2/3 would be 282 The Senate passed with 65-32, 2/3 would be 65 Total votes =520 and 2/3 would be 346. Total yes votes was 347. Granted that is total congress but the chances were high that they would have overridden his veto! /3 #TrumpArmy https://t.co/eGVHBTeuDz 
 If they did, we still have the bill and Trump looks even worse for being overpowered. Not to mention the Government would have been shut down through the weekend and that hurts our military! Congress does not care! /4 #DrainingTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp #Congress https://t.co/taJymXGbEn 
 Trump signed a great deal for the military. The best we have had. He took advantage of the moment since it‚Äôs all he could do. Keep in mind, he can always repeal portions we don‚Äôt like, the same way he repealed 11 Obama legacy items in his first year. /5 https://t.co/NCIzUtELUR 
 I hear people saying they will give up on Trump and vote third party. What does that get you? That puts Democrats in power and we really lose. We need to band together more than ever. I saw his speech. He was visually upset about the bill. Let‚Äôs not back down. /6 https://t.co/MiIBr1p44f
