the 4yo and I are going to Legoland today. we‚Äôre so fucking amped we might punch somebody 
 we will be there for 30 hours. she packed five sets of clothes 
 she‚Äôs also insisting on bringing a tiny mesh bag of seashells. ‚Äúfor the hotel,‚Äù she says mysteriously 
 she LOVES the construction tarps. why did i even pay for admission https://t.co/Ge2geFAakg 
 ‚Äúlook at all the Legos!‚Äù üôÑ 
 kids are so spoiled. when i was young there were no Lego Abbi Jacobsons, let alone ninja ones https://t.co/AQjo2BpAvq 
 ugh, she spilled chocolate milk on herself. we cleaned it before it could stain but we have less total chocolate milk now 
 ((Legoland version of) the Las Vegas version of) the Eiffel Tower! #lifeontop https://t.co/ldn3hodKhx 
 sunset. all the key choices were mine https://t.co/03cKSJS2qN 
 ride grades Fairy Tale Brook: A- Safari Trek: D FUCK Safari Trek 
 for those asking: daughter forbade coasters. she needs more time to recover from the horrors of The Simpsons Ride 
 THERE‚ÄôS A BENIHANA NEXT TO OUR LA QUINTA 
 there‚Äôs a long wait, and daughter is gassed, but i think we have to make this happen 
 punted on Benihana ‚Äî she‚Äôs too tired. still managed to rustle up a dece rite of passage for her #lifeontop https://t.co/i0wUUyzXUL 
 she conked out hours ago but this is how I think she'd rank today's attractions 6. Safari Trek 5. merry-go-round 4. Miniland New Orleans 3. playing with some Legos 2. Fairy Tale Brook 1. meeting Nya/electric hand dryer in bathroom (tie) 
 day 2 begins. she is dazzled by the La Quinta breakfast spread, as she should be https://t.co/XfrPyMoVgG 
 we‚Äôve agreed she gets two small Lego sets on this trip (she turns five later this month. her first selection was from the Lego Friends line. I don‚Äôt trust these Lego Friends 
 as best I can tell the Lego Friends are a quint of hyper-fit girls who constantly do synchronized dances and accuse each other of excluding them 
 daughter selected Mia‚Äôs Bedroom. Mia sleeps on a lofted bed fitted with a ramp for her to slide down in the morning and skateboard up at night. get over yourself, Mia 
 Ninjago is a mixed bag but I‚Äôm not gonna say this isn‚Äôt awesome https://t.co/BIFyF7pFGx 
 IS THE LEGOLAND WHITE HOUSE PROJECTING A WARREN WIN??? https://t.co/oTusYjZUbE 
 could be Bill Burr, I guess https://t.co/IhAIeu9VQl 
 daughter‚Äôs main reaction to Legoland DC: ‚Äúlook, somebody dropped an almond!‚Äù 
 she insisted I take this pic. weird https://t.co/ByLcl0BXJ1 
 ride grades Cargo Ace: C- Beetle Bounce: F (her grade, went solo) Royal Joust: A (hg, ws) 
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not excited for Fun Town.‚Äù 
 ride grades Skipper School: B Captain Cranky‚Äôs Challenge: B Lego Factory Tour: A+++. incredible. the purest dad porn 
 daughter is all graded out but I‚Äôd give Legoland an A-minus. the following, from me, is a big compliment: it feels like a mini-golf course 
 we will hopefully review the coasters next time, unless... someone follows us https://t.co/jb8AOR14dz
