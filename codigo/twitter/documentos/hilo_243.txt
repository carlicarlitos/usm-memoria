Know how Social Security and Medicare are referred to as the “third rail” – because cutting them is understood to be political suicide? Well, it turns out it’s not just Social Security &amp; Medicare. Follow along for details on a new poll the GOP should pay close attention to. 1/x 
 Trump and Congressional Republicans learned the hard way last year how immensely popular Medicaid is, when in many ways it saved the ACA. New polling shows a whopping **80% of Americans** oppose cutting Medicaid. 2/x 
 And it’s not just Medicaid folks don’t want to see cut. Americans overwhelmingly—and across party lines—oppose President Trump and Speaker Ryan’s proposals to slash nutrition assistance, affordable housing, disability benefits, energy assistance, and more. 3/x 
 Among the poll's findings: ☑️ 78% oppose cutting Social Security disability benefits ☑️ 78% oppose cutting LIHEAP ☑️ 77% oppose cutting Unemployment Insurance ☑️ 73% oppose cutting affordable housing ☑️ 66% oppose cutting nutrition assistance 4/x 
 NOTE TO @GOP: Opposition to cutting these and other critical programs cuts *across party lines* -- with majorities of Trump voters and Republicans opposing these cuts. 5/x 
 @GOP Meanwhile, the poll finds that people understand Trump and Ryan’s proposals to slash these and other critical programs are to pay for the recently passed #TrumpTaxScam -- which makes them oppose benefit cuts even more. 6/x 
 @GOP Now for the kicker… Majorities of Americans report they would be *less likely to vote for* a candidate who supports cuts to these programs. READ: If the GOP moves forward w/ proposals to cut Medicaid, nutrition, housing, &amp; more, they'll be signing their own pink slips. 7/x 
 @GOP A big part of why Americans oppose cuts to programs that help families afford the basics is because they get that they’re there for ALL OF US when we need them, rather than some mythical THEM. 8/x 
 @GOP Fully 70% report their family had a serious issue w/at least one of the following in the past year: - finding job w/decent wages - unable to get medical care b/c of cost - too little $ to buy food - paying rent/mortgage - paying credit card - paying gas/electric/phone bill 9/x 
 @GOP And it’s not just folks struggling to make ends meet *today* who get that these programs are there for them when they need them... 10/x 
 @GOP 65% say “Even if I may not need them now, I’m glad our society provides govt services to ensure basic living standards when times get tough” vs. 19%: “I don’t envision ever being in a position where I'd need/want healthcare/nutrition/housing/income suppt provided by govt" 11/x 
 @GOP And all that scaremongering the GOP has been doing about the “unsustainable” deficits they’ve conveniently forgotten they jacked up with the #TrumpTaxScam? People aren’t buying it as an excuse to cut critical programs. 12/x 
 @GOP By a 60 percent-to-20 percent margin, voters say: “It is more important to me to help provide basic living standards like housing, nutrition, and health care for those struggling to make ends meet” .... 13/x 
 @GOP vs. this: “It is more important to me to address large budget deficits by reducing overall spending on government assistance programs for low-income people.” 14/x 
 @GOP As I said before, the GOP learned the hard way during the healthcare fight how popular Medicaid is. If they think they can slash programs that help families afford food, housing, and heating costs with zero political consequences… well, they’ve got another thing coming. 15/x 
 @GOP That's even true when it comes to the GOP's so-called "work requirements" in Medicaid -- which are really time limits on health care for unemployed and underemployed workers. 16/x 
 @GOP Our polling shows that when people understand the consequences of so-called "work requirements" -- that people will end up losing health care if they can't find a job/get enough hours at work -- majorities of voters OPPOSE these cruel policies. 17/x 
 @GOP So what are you waiting for? Tell @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan and their colleagues in Congress #HandsOff -- and join the fight &amp; share your story of what cuts to Medicaid, housing, food assistance and more would mean to you and your family at https://t.co/QkNSUQPGcB. /end
