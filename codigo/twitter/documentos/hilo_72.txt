This is such a shocking story in its details. We shrug off #DataPrivacy because we think it's basically inconsequential to our real lives. But the impact of #CambridgeAnalytica just began to be felt in 2015 and spread to 50 MILLION or 1 in 6 Americans. 1/ https://t.co/GPUtcPExEF 
 The panoply of ways Trump used his cachet w/ billionaire supporters like the Mercers should concern everyone, including those on the right &amp; left who just eyeroll these investigations as about #HillaryClinton when that's tangential to our national security &amp; honest elections. 2/ https://t.co/OJ73CmluIB 
 Every American should want to know what happened in 2016 because every American who's a critical thinker knows the person who wins the most votes won the election. Moreover, everyone knows Democratic systems ensure an unskewed result, unlike #Russia's imminent election. 3/ https://t.co/ge5029OrZ9 
 FB denying a data breach happened parallels Americans being told #HillaryClinton didn't reach working class voters when she won voters making &lt;$50k overwhelmingly and also won women &amp; POC--80% of America's working class. These lies go beyond 2016 to impact 2018 &amp; 2020. 4/ 
 What will happen to #CambridgeAnalyticaFiles? Where will that accumulated data from the "non-data breach" go? How much of it has already been sold to some other entity? Details are staggering. Two decisive votes were involved: #Brexit &amp; US POTUS election 2016. Both upsets. 5/ https://t.co/OwqYlgz7ke 
 Pundits can assert myriad reasons for both #Brexit &amp; Trump winning upsets. But ignoring the information revealed Friday on #CambridgeAnalytica would be nonsensical. The culpability of the Trump administration is revealed daily. But will anyone ever be held responsible? 6/ https://t.co/KY3kKoTaR4 
 Assiduous work, some genius and the Mercers billions fueled #CambridgeAnalytica. That they got the desired result was by no means an accident. 7_ https://t.co/5xGAVN9BWh 
 Where do we go now? With the #AndrewMcCabe &amp; #StormyDaniels scandals, as well as the latest call by Trump's attorneys to end the #MuellerInvestigation, will this even survive the weekend news cycle or will it--with help from #Facebook--be buried? Troubling questions all. 8/ https://t.co/ELkRizxpaS
