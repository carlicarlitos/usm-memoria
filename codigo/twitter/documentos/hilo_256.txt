1/ Want to write more? Here’s how. 👇 Thread 👇 
 2/ Writing forces you to pay attention. Every experience doubles as a potential future sentence. When you know you’re going to write, you change how you live. It takes you to a higher level of perception. 
 3/ Writing is the best kind of networking. I love this advice from @andrewchen: "Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity. Stay home, don't go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down.” 
 4/ Creation is the most valuable part of learning. Start remixing ideas. It clarifies your thinking. As a wise man once said: "Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise." 
 5/ Getting started is the most important thing. As @paulg says: Expect 80% of the ideas in an article to come after you start writing it. 
 6/ Most people spend too much time consuming and not enough producing. People stop writing after college. It’s a systemic issue — information is infinite. There’s always more to consume. Consumption is our default setting. https://t.co/TTjiefO2Fn 
 7/ The world pops. Ideas spring to life. You read differently. You think differently. You listen differently. 
 8/ Originality is over-rated. Many of the most popular people on the internet simply remix information. They take existing ideas and remix them in productive ways. Everybody wins. Readers get to learn. You get free marketing. Authors get more visibility. 
 9/ This is the secret to @jordanbpeterson success. He makes important ideas easy-to-understand. He recombines old ideas and makes them relevant. The most interesting examples: 1. The Bible 2. Carl Jung 3. Nietzche By remixing ideas, he’s changed millions of lives. 
 10/ Some of my other favorites below. @tylercowen re-packages the best ideas from economics papers. https://t.co/q2hg0Lbj7f 
 11/ @danwwang has excellent summaries of Peter Thiel’s ideas. https://t.co/UO6GKD6Q64 
 12/ @trengriffin remixes the best lessons from investors, writers, and cultural icons. https://t.co/znx0oXKb1g 
 13/ @farnamstreet helps people understand how the world works, make better decisions, and live a better life. https://t.co/Ev9PBF0JBf 
 14/ Re-combining ideas is powerful. Especially when they come from a variety of areas. As @WalterIsaacson once said: “People who are interested in the widest variety of things tend to see the patterns of nature in ways that make them creative." 
 15/ Here's the key takeaway. Writing doesn't just communicate ideas — it generates them. Writing is thinking. Writing is learning. When you have free time, have a bias towards writing. ✌
