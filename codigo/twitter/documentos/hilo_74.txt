BOOM! Zuckerberg interview by @nxthompson is more substantial than CNN TV interview. Gets into #CambridgeAnalytica #CambridgeAnalytics https://t.co/CB1Y99qmm3 
 “And the other thing I’d say is that we have temporarily paused the audit to cede to the UK regulator, the @ICOnews, so that they can do a government investigation—I think it might be a criminal investigation, but it’s a government investigation at a minimum.” -Zuck 
 As far as I can tell, CA/SCL is not cooperating with @ICOnews. They are being defiant scoundrels. I do not understand why Zuck was dumb enough to hire Stroz Friedberg who did the whitewash AlfaBank/TrumptTower report for Trump appointee. 
 I'm still waiting for Zuck to be asked why he allowed CA/SCL to upload their data into Facebook using Custom Audiences during the summer of 2016. He sent in embedded employees (interviewed by Mueller) to work alongside CA/SCL sharing data. 
 I'm still waiting for Zuck to be asked by he hired Joseph Chancellor from GSR, Kogan's partner. How can he justify the above? 
 I'm still waiting for Zuck to acknowledge that I've accomplished more than him and I have no resources and he has virtually unlimited resources. 
 Zuck should sponsor my personal (cyber)defense force to take these bastards on. https://t.co/eRSQ5QvT08
