💣BOOM💣 Mueller is asking witnesses "pointed questions" on whether Trump was aware that Democratic emails had been HACKED before it was publicly known &amp; whether he was involved in their strategic release‼️ 1/ #TrumpRussia #RICO h/t @traciemac_Bmore https://t.co/30nK6NSls7 
 Specifically, Team🇺🇸Mueller is probing whether Trump was aware of plans for #WikiLeaks to publish the STOLEN emails.🤔 OF COURSE, Trump *knew*, because PapaD told the campaign about the stolen emails‼️ And PapaD is squealing.😎 2/ 
 PapaD got drunk and spilled his guts to an Aussie "diplomat" in London about #Russia's🇷🇺plan to "anonymously release" Democratic emails. And how? That's right. WIKILEAKS w/whom Trump Jr and Roger Stone were corresponding DURING the campaign‼️ 3/ #Busted cc @911CORLEBRA777 https://t.co/DXAEpMuLhk 
 So #SHOCKER (not), Team🇷🇺Mueller is probing whether Trump knew of plans for WikiLeaks to publish the STOLEN emails. If Trump knew, that's a CRIME‼️ (Spoiler alert: Trump knew) 4/ #TrumpRussia #RICO 
 Team🇺🇸Mueller also asked witnesses about the relationship btwn Roger Stone &amp; #WikiLeaks' Julian Assange, and why Trump took policy positions favorable to #Russia🇷🇺. Gee, why would Trump be favorable to Russia?🙄 5/ #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime 
 🔥Mueller has asked WITNESSES (meaning: MULTIPLE) about Trump's public comments in Jul'16 asking #Russia to HACK Hillary's emails: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing." 6/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Then-WH spokesman, Spicey, later claimed that then-candidate Trump had been "joking" when he called on #Russia to hack his opponent's emails.🙄 But you know that Mueller is NOT buying this bunkum AT ALL‼️ 7/ #MuellerTime #RICO 
 🔥Witnesses (MULTIPLE) have been asked if Trump knew *in July 2016* that John Podesta had already been targeted, *MONTHS BEFORE* Podesta's stolen emails were leaked‼️ 8/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Mueller also asked witnesses if "someone outside the campaign" advised Trump to ask #Russia🇷🇺to hack Clinton's emails, and whether Trump tried to COORDINATE the release of the STOLEN emails to do the most damage to Clinton.🧐 (Spoiler alert: YES) 9/ #Busted #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 🔥STONE🔥 Mueller is probing Trump's longtime relationship w/Stone, Stone's contacts w/#WikiLeaks DURING the campaign &amp; if Stone met w/Assange.😎 10/ #RICO #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime 
 Here's what someone who was INTERVIEWED by Mueller said about #Stone: "They wanted to see if there was a scheme. Was Stone working on the side for Trump?" AFTER he officially left the campaign.🤨 "Was this a big plot"⁉️ (Spoiler alert: YES) 11/ https://t.co/dnaYwblEFj 
 Thanks to @RepAdamSchiff's memo, we know that #Russian🇷🇺agents told PapaD about their plot to hack and disseminated STOLEN emails. PapaD was *desperate* to advance his career. He told an Aussie about the #Russian plot, so he certainly told the Trump campaign‼️ 12/ https://t.co/vuaFxcoHEf 
 And of course, we also know about Jr's "treasonous" meeting with the #RussianLawyer🇷🇺in Trump Tower (along w/Manafort &amp; Kush), where they discussed #sanctions &amp; HRC #kompromat w/a "former" Russian spy, who is expert in getting HACKED info‼️ 13/ https://t.co/jg7wGEJR40 
 Mueller is probing Stone's statements that strongly suggest he KNEW of info that #WikiLeaks had BEFORE it was public and when it would be released. Just weeks after Stone's tweet, Podesta's STOLEN emails were leaked by WikiLeaks.🙄 TWEETS are gonna nail these traitors‼️🤣 14/ https://t.co/03H2Izky2o 
 Concurrent with Stone's conspiring with #WikiLeaks, and WikiLeaks *strategically publishing* STOLEN emails in the final stages of the campaign, Trump *himself* publicly PRAISED them, saying, "I love WikiLeaks!"🙄 15/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Mueller is also probing Stone's connections w/WikiLeaks &amp; Assange. Stone DENIED communicating w/them &amp; said he communicated w/Assange &amp; WikiLeaks through an intermediary. @NatashaBertrand just reported that Stone exchanged DMs w/WikiLeaks.😎 16/ #Busted https://t.co/Y4ktw1peO0 
 Investigators have asked witnesses about Stone's time on the campaign and what his relationship was like with Trump after he left.🤨 "How often did they talk? Who really fired him? Was he really fired?" Answers: Often. No one. NOPE‼️😉 17/ 
 Stone claims he had "no advance knowledge of the content or source of information published by WikiLeaks." "I have not been interviewed by the special counsel." That's because Stone is a TARGET of Mueller's grand jury‼️🤗 18/ 
 At the SAME Jul'16 news conference, Trump asked #Russia🇷🇺to hack Clinton's emails &amp; said he was open to lifting #sanctions. Mueller is probing why Trump took pro-Russia policy positions &amp; spoke positively about Putin.🤔 Answer: #kompromat 19/ 
 Mueller is also probing WHEN Trump first met his pal Putin, and whether they met during Trump's 2013 Miss Universe Moscow.🧐 Of course, Trump has given "conflicting responses" (LIES) on when he first met Putin.🙄 20/ 
 *At least one witness* has been asked about Dan SCAVINO, specifically about any involvement he may have had in the campaign's DATA OPERATION‼️ 21/ #RICO #TrumpRussia 
 Witnesses also have been asked about notorious "dirty trickster" Stone's connections to #Russian🇷🇺agent Manafort. You know, the guys who've known each other FOREVER‼️ 22/ https://t.co/PY9qemISIt 
 Team🇺🇸Mueller knows MUCH more than what's in this report (and MUCH earlier). Have ZERO doubts. Team🇷🇺Traitor is GOING DOWN‼️ /end #TrumpRussia #RICO #MuellerTime
