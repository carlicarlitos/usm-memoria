THREAD: It’s hard to keep up with all the threats facing young children these days, but recent changes to the EPA are particularly alarming for children’s health: /10 https://t.co/CrzmtjF8AX 
 Our children deserve environmental policies that will protect their health. But @EPAScottPruitt is protecting large corporations and the chemical industry instead #BootPruitt 
 @EPAScottPruitt Here are 5 recent environmental safety changes that are threatening children’s health https://t.co/CrzmtjF8AX 
 @EPAScottPruitt 1. Pruitt has reversed a ban on chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide and known neurotoxin that has been shown to cause brain abnormalities in children #BootPruitt 
 @EPAScottPruitt 2. The EPA weakened standards for toxic metals—like lead and mercury—in our air and water. Children, particularly low-income children of color, could risk ingesting these metals through the water they drink and the air they breathe. 
 @EPAScottPruitt 3. The EPA is allowing corporations to release more pollutants into the air. Poor air quality can cause damage ranging from asthma to lung disease. 
 @EPAScottPruitt 4. The EPA is now letting chemicals go to the market, even if there are concerns about the risks of potential uses. Chemicals are everywhere—including food packaging and children’s furniture—and not fully testing their safety could have serious consequences for kids. 
 @EPAScottPruitt 5. The EPA announced that it would close an important office that studies the effects of chemical exposure, which could leave children in danger of being exposed to toxic substances. 
 @EPAScottPruitt Rather than prioritize big corporations, our representatives must do what is best for the health and safety of America’s children
