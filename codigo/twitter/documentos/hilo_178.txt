I've talked before about Russian #disinformation, and how the goal is to exploit existing divisive issues to weaken the enemy. 1 #InformationWarfare #WednesdayWisdom #CambridgeAnalytica #Russie #Putin #deza https://t.co/ZUKnXkFNEr 
 Bernie v. Hillary, Benghazi &amp; the "email scandal" were perfect targets. There was already tension &amp; division on those topics, so they were easy to exploit. 2 https://t.co/GnwuyWVnCo 
 Russia also targeted #peopleofcolor (specifically black voters) to sow distrust of Hillary &amp; the political process, which helped Trump's campaign. 3 https://t.co/tSFC9aCrcC 
 #Mueller's indictment states that a Russian troll farm had the specific goal of discouraging African Americans from voting to benefit the Trump campaign. 4 #RussianTalkingPoints #HybridWar https://t.co/68wnsGNGWa 
 Russian accounts Woke Blacks and Blacktivists encouraged followers to vote for 3rd party candidates, or not vote at all which benefited Trump. 5 https://t.co/aDH1phAbZc 
 Russian trolls have targeted people of color before, posing as American #POC and using hashtags to attract specific followers. 6 #Minority #Manipulation #fraud #SCAM #masquerade https://t.co/kSP2wOxX6f 
 An account called "BlackMattersUS" promoted already scheduled protests &amp; connected with well known activists to gain legitimacy and followers. 7 #manipulation #minorityvoter https://t.co/R6GXGrVKZG 
 Russians also used the account Woke Blacks to urge black &amp; Muslim voters to vote for Jill Stein, or not vote, both of which benefited the Trump campaign. 8 #VOTE #VOTERREGISTRATION #VoterSuppression https://t.co/1HXpB111MM 
 #Mueller's indictment details a 3 year plan to influence the 2016 election, using Stein, Sanders &amp; inflaming racial divides to fracture the liberal vote further &amp; help Trump's campaign. 9 #RussianSpy #intereference https://t.co/yiLFEYF7mA 
 The #FBI obtained emails from a Russian in St. Petersburg telling her family about a crisis at work when the FBI discovered their operations. 10 https://t.co/LcjCLr72PA 
 Two Russian women visited 9 US states in summer 2014, including key electoral states to gather intelligence - find weak points to exploit to divide left leaning voters and hurt Clinton's chances. 11 #divided #faction #arguing #DivideAndRule #ChaosEngineering https://t.co/k7zYMgwclQ 
 #racism is nothing new to #Putin, who suggested that Ukrainians, Tatars and Jews with Russian citizenship could be the culprits behind the election #meddling. 12 https://t.co/frVfGQmWT3 
 Clint Watts @selectedwisdom is positive that Putin that was behind the disinformation campaign to help Trump win the presidency, as the companies behind the effort are controlled by Putin's friend &amp; ally. 13 https://t.co/w4lPhitpX9 
 So we now KNOW that one of Putin's strategies was to target POC and convince them to vote 3rd party (which split the vote) or not vote, both of which benefited the #GOP. 14 https://t.co/aBRvJxz7PW 
 This worked very well for Putin, and so far there's no proof tying this to him. I expect to see Russians posing as #latino voters exploiting frustration about #DACA &amp; #Immigrationreform telling followers to vote 3rd party or not vote. It's probably already happening. 15 #latin https://t.co/p4k8tqHgJb 
 Putin WILL KEEP DOING THIS. And we all know how awful Twitter is about shutting down bots &amp; trolls. He owns trump and the GOP is #Complicit. 16 https://t.co/GgIYrYtpVJ 
 #TheResistance has been more effective than Trump and the #GOP thought it could be. That means we're a threat, and a target for disinformation campaigns. 17 https://t.co/fY26MG9H2g 
 Taking back #congress would be a huge blow to Trump and the GOP, and Putin worked hard to help Trump win. He will tweet to stop us. I'm sure #disinformation is already being spread to that end. 18 https://t.co/dCnAX4zcgX 
 So stay sharp. Read about this #hybridwar and the very real danger of Russia's disinformation campaigns. You can't protect against it if you don't know about it. Beware of attempts to divide us. They know we're #StrongerTogether . https://t.co/KsumCpONRK
