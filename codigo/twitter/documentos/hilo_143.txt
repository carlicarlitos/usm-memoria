1) #NicolasSarkozy was #France’s president 2007-2012, was arrested &amp; is being questioned about his illegally financed campaign by #Gaddafi in #Libya, some backstory. How did Sarkozy go from accepting #illegal cash to advocating overthrow? #QAnon #Corruption @POTUS #FRA #LeMonde https://t.co/tzaWUZv68L 
 2) A total of $50m was funneled. And it wasn't done via wire transfer. Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takkiedine claims he carried suitcases full of cash in 2006 and 2007. $50m is double the legal campaign limit in France. https://t.co/UGAzz55pTJ #QAnon #TheStormIsHere 
 3) This story is not new. Here is an article from it back in 2014. https://t.co/QJKzWCELhz #Sarkozy is a corrupt #swamp rat. He's been dogged by corruption claims forever. A simple search will show a laundry list. #qanon #DrainTheSwamp #France #Corruption 
 4) For example Sarkozy was charged in 2013 for allegations his party took envelopes stuffed w cash from #France's richest woman, L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt. Those charges were dropped. Remind you of anyone? #Hillary? These #elites seem to all get away with everything. 
 5) #HillaryClinton. Again. Always seems to circle back to the queen of the #DeepState. Both #Clinton &amp; #Sarkozy were the 2 biggest advocates for overthrow around 2011. Again, you take a guy's money then advocate overthrow? Why? #qanon #GreatAwakening @POTUS #TheStormHasArrived 
 6) There was pay for play going on between #Lybia and #France. Qaddafi traveled to France in December '07, immediately after Sarkozy's first election as president for a 5 day visit to make a $200 million arms deal. So this is what #Gaddafi was after, and who knows what else. 
 7) The Sidney Blumenthal emails show a confusing picture of France's about face on Libya. The cover story was a pan-African gold backed currency, but it seems a bit less sophisticated... control of Libyan oil. #qanon #Oil @POTUS #TheStormIsUponUs #Africa 
 8) France wanted #Qaddafi out: #newspaper #Libération published a leaked letter from Libya's rebel-backed National Transitional Council promising 35 percent of the country's crude oil to France in return for its "total and permanent support." #BOOM #QAnon #Libya #Corruption 
 9) So French intelligence service DGSE held secret meetings w Libyan opposition &amp; started funding them. The French promised that as soon as the National Transitional Council was set up, they'd recognize it as government of Libya. Recognition = new chapter in corruption. #Qanon 
 10) So #Sarkozy turned on #Qaddafi for the oil. How does this relate back to the #USA's interests, and the #Hillary #StateDept? Here is where we speculate a bit. Yes, there were "stated" reasons for #US intervention, but they are never true. What was the real reason? #QAnon 
 11) The long standing rumor is that #Kadhafi was taken out because they discovered where his cash was hidden. The #Clinton #StateDept in cahoots with the #Cabal and #CIA all saw an opportunity to grab it. Remember that Red Cross cash video? #QanonPosts https://t.co/mZRTFSf0Hj 
 12) Events like the Libyan overthrow happen for complex reasons. Ghaddafi's desire to split from central banking is true, he wanted an African gold backed currency. Who runs central banking? #Rothschilds Nobody would have been allowed to do this without their green light. #Qanon 
 14) All the nations that toppled Libya had different interests, and so did bankers and globalists. A bunch of lies were crafted for the public to consume, and the #Cabal moves another step forward implementing the #NWO. @POTUS #UN #DeepState #Banking #ARMS #Oil #plunder #Qanon 
 15) Today Libya is a complete mess, garbage #Government, thriving #slavery trade, #organisedcrime is rampant, mass #MigrationEU, #drugdealers &amp; #terrorist groups. All a direct result of #Obama's foreign policy, #Hillary's corruption, #Sarkosy, and the #cabal. #Qanon #EU @POTUS
