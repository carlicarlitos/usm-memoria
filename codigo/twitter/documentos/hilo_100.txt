🔥WHOA🔥 Trump was so eager for­ Putin to attend the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, he *wrote a PERSONAL letter* to Putin to invite him‼️ Trump wrote a PS at the end of the typed letter👉🏼he looked forward to seeing “beautiful” women during his trip.🤨 https://t.co/94aZLmIYb0 
 Trump’s letter is the first known attempt of DIRECT outreach by him to Putin, and Mueller now has it‼️🤗 It is unclear whether Trump’s letter was ever delivered to Putin — and if so, whether Putin responded.🤔 2/ 
 Trump’s lawyer, John Dowd, said he didn’t know about the letter.l, but claimed, “It’s all nonsense.”🤨 Likely, there are MANY things that Trump did about which Dowd has ZERO CLUE‼️ 3/ 
 Trump made no secret that he hoped Putin would attend the Miss Universe pageant, and of course, he TWEETED about it‼️ His letter to Putin was written the *same month* as👇🏼this tweet👇🏼 4/ https://t.co/SZzQ1TBAAQ 
 Alas, Trump’s bromance w/Putin was not yet to be, as Putin BAILED at the last minute.🤣 Aras Agalarov said, “That was a very complicated situation then, because I promised Trump he would meet Putin.”🤨 5/ 
 Instead, Putin sent a lovely parting gift to Trump in the form of a “friendly” letter and a Russian lacquered box.🤔 Agalarov said, “So he was leaving with very warm feelings. He was very happy.”🤨 WHAT WAS IN THE LETTER⁉️ 6/ 
 Team🇺🇸Mueller have asked witnesses questions about the Miss Universe pageant and Trump’s interest in having Putin attend the event‼️ They also have examined Trump’s relationship with the Agalarovs, which extended beyond the 2013 pageant.🤗 BIGLY BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP‼️ 7/ 
 Rob Goldstone (promoter of Emin, son of Aras Agalarov) emailed Don Jr to arrange the #RussianLawyer meeting. Goldstone wrote that Aras learned the Kremlin wanted to share DIRT on Hillary, as part of the #Russian🇷🇺govt’s support for Trump’s campaign. Jr replied, “I love it.”🤨8/ 
 Aras Agalarov sent one of his employees (Ike Kazeladze) to the #RussianLawyer🇷🇺meeting w/Kush, Manafort &amp; Jr that included KNOWN Kremlin agent, Natalia Veselnitskaya‼️🤨 9/ https://t.co/jg7wGEJR40 
 Trump has been inconsistent on whether he met Putin before the election.🙄 In Oct’13, he told Letterman that Putin was a “tough guy” &amp; he had “met him once.” At a GOP primary debate in Nov’15, Trump said he knew Putin “very well.” In Jul’16, he said, “I never met Putin.”🤨10/ 
 Mueller is focused like a LASER on *Trump himself*‼️ And it’s clear that this will NOT end well for Trump. AT ALL‼️😎 /end #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia
