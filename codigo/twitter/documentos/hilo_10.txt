This is wrong. The judge can/will make a condition of/clause in any probation, suspended sentence, deferred sentence, or sentencing order that Papadopoulos comply with all prior orders and/or agreements regarding his cooperation with the Trump-Russia probe. A very bad take here. https://t.co/78Gltwf6Q6 
 2/ Papadopoulos failing to live by his agreements with the feds/the court could lead to charges being brought forward that were previously withheld and/or contempt charges and/or reopening investigations otherwise on hold. None of the conditions Joyce said could be present exist. 
 3/ The idea Mueller would dump Papadopoulos as a witness just because his sentencing—which will have conditions attached to it—can't be forestalled forever is ridiculous, and has nothing to do with any reality within the criminal justice system federally or at the state level. 
 4/ I should also add, as I accidentally left it out of Tweet #2, that should Papadopoulos have a suspended or deferred sentence, or probation of any kind, any violation of any conditions of those statuses could lead to immediate imposition of some or all of a prison sentence. 
 5/ The chances Papadopoulos will be under court supervision for some period of time approach 100%, and prosecutors will ensure it's longer than the Trump-Russia probe. His sentencing will also acknowledge that the feds are withholding charges in consideration of his cooperation.
