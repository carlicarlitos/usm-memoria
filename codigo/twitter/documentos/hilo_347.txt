(THREAD) This thread lists EVERY bombshell in Carter Page's Congressional testimony—each summarized in ONE sentence. Hope you'll pass it on. https://t.co/WEY0Rbxnt6 
 BOMBSHELL: The White House lied repeatedly about how active Trump's secretive NatSec Advisory Committee was—it met MANY times, not "once." 
 BOMBSHELL: Kremlin agents lured Page to Russia to meet Kremlin officials and Rosneft execs AFTER he joined the campaign; it wasn't his idea. 
 BOMBSHELL: MANY Trump campaign aides AND NatSec team members knew Page was going to Russia post-hacking revelations—none tried to stop him. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page bypassed top policy aides and NatSec peers in telling HOPE HICKS he was going to Russia—suggesting he wanted TRUMP to know. 
 BOMBSHELL: Given Page and JD Gordon's words, Hicks LIED to the media in saying the campaign had no Russia contacts; she's a key witness now. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page spoke to the FBI 5-6 times in 2016-7; if he told them what he told Congress, he can be charged with Making False Statements. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page deliberately withheld deeply inculpatory documents from Congress using a false and legally fraudulent Fifth Amendment claim. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page met the same Kremlin official and Rosneft exec in BOTH July and December 2016 and lied about BOTH interactions to Congress. 
 BOMBSHELL: On July 7, 2016, the Kremlin asked Page to carry a message to Trump: we strongly support you and want to work with you on policy. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page admits discussing sanctions policy with both the Kremlin and Rosneft in July; after, he briefed the campaign on these talks. 
 BOMBSHELL: As Page briefed the NatSec team and the campaign on his secret Russia meetings, every Trump aide who denied Russia contacts lied. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page was certain to keep Trump's daily assistant, Hope Hicks, in the loop—Sessions, too—so Trump and Sessions knew what Page did. 
 BOMBSHELL: As of mid-July, Trump's campaign was *on notice* Russia supported it, wanted to help it, and was offering "outreach"—cooperation. 
 BOMBSHELL: When Trump said "Russia, if you're listening..." and asked it to release Clinton emails, he was *responding* to Russian outreach. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page *directly* revealed his Moscow plans to Sessions at an event Sessions set up—didn't disclose—and sat beside Papadopoulos at. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page admits "the whole [NatSec] group" got Papadopoulos' March 2016 email on the Kremlin wanting to meet—that'd include Sessions. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page proposed the campaign tell him what to say in Moscow—thus, *to Kremlin agents*—and/or have Trump take the trip in his place. 
 BOMBSHELL: Everything the Steele Dossier said about Page appears to be either exactly accurate or so close to it as to be indistinguishable. 
 BOMBSHELL: During his July '16 trip Page discussed the upcoming sale of Rosneft with Rosneft's Investor Relations chief—a key dossier claim. 
 BOMBSHELL: AFTER we knew of Russia hacking—but BEFORE Trump changed the GOP platform to benefit Putin—Page told Clovis Russia favored Trump. 
 BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team talked lifting sanctions on Russia—maybe unilaterally—from its earliest days, *right after* the Mayflower Speech. 
 BOMBSHELL: The NatSec team knew Page was headed to Moscow as a "private citizen" concurrent to discussing sending a "private citizen" there. 
 BOMBSHELL: Multiple NatSec team members (at least 3) went to Budapest, the European HQ for Russian intelligence; Page met "a Russian" there. 
 BOMBSHELL: At least 7 of the NatSec team's 14 members were on an email about the GOP platform change—and at least TEN campaign members knew. 
 BOMBSHELL: None of the NINE campaign members who *knew* Manafort was lying about Trump's role in the GOP platform change revealed the truth. 
 BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST ten members of the campaign and the NatSec team knew they were helping Putin at a time the Kremlin was supporting Trump. 
 BOMBSHELL: Page met Kremlin/Rosneft officials in Moscow in December '16—including contact with the MANAGER of Putin's election interference. 
 CONCLUSION: These 28 bombshells are what we learned simply from DECEITFUL Congressional testimony. So just IMAGINE what MUELLER knows. {end}
