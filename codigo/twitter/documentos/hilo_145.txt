Live at #io18, human-centered #AI4all thought leader @drfeifei w/ #GoogleBrain's @greg_corrado chatting about the future of #AI for everyone w/ #DianeGreene, pics by @AILaPaz's ambassador @AnitaRui2 &amp; @WTMLaPaz's @wondermony https://t.co/n8uZQCXvqU 
 2/ @drfeifei on #MachineIntellligence history: 3 critical factors converged to brought us the AI boom: advances in hardware, emergence of powerful big data and advances in deep learning and machine learning algorithms 
 3/ @greg_corrado: renaissance in neural networks &amp; deep learning and recently reinforcement learning leads the re-convergence of disciplines like cognitive science, neuroscience and #AI who have been separated for a while. 
 4/ @greg_corrado on #AGI: machines can do pattern recognition every bit as well as humans can, but it is a tiny sliver of what goes into something like intelligence. We haven't even scratched the surface of memory, planning, strategy, contingency and even #EQ. 
 5/ @drfeifei on #AGI: "humanity has a tendency to overestimate short term progress and underestimate long term progress, so eventually we will be achieving things that we can not dream of" 
 6/ @drfeifei's 1st element to complete human-centered #AI thinking: advancing AI to the next stage, there is a need for AI to be more flexible, nuanced, learn faster, more unsupervised, semi-supervised learning ways, understand emotion, communicate with humans. 
 7/ @drfeifei's 2nd element is technology and application: this tech is to enhance/augment humans, not to replace them, will replace certain tasks and replace humans out of danger, but the bottom line is we can use #AI to help doctors, disaster relief workers, decision makers. 
 8/ @drfeifei's 3rd element is combine thinking of #AI as a tech as well as societal impact: bring social scientists, philosophers, law scholars, policy makers, ethicists and historians to study more deeply about #AI social humanistic impact. 
 9/ @greg_corrado on explainable #AI: unfortunate mythology that deep learning is a black box which it really isn't, there are tools that examine how these systems work and explainability is a big part in terms of making these things available for a bunch of applications. 
 10/ @drfeifei's 2 major kind of #bias: one is the pipeline of #AI development from bias of data to the outcome of the bias, and the second is the human bias, the people who are developing #AI and the lack of diversity. 
 11/ @greg_corrado on #AI's future: one of the great opportunities is going to be the development of artificial emotional intelligence that allows products to actually have much more natural and more fluid human interactions.
