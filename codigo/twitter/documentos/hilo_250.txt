Q posted screen shots of two tweets @Snowden retweeted re: Secure Drop (whistle blower site used by Freedom of the Press - co-founded by Barlow who is now dead.) showing how Clowns leak to press to get their 4am talking points. Daily Beast wrote about it: https://t.co/Ke7jxb5gMY https://t.co/zf9NgBPaCk 
 2. An anon noted how AFTER last night's drop re: silence by HRC, BC, CC, and Hussein about the FL shooting, Bill and Hillary showed up on twitter. Q responds by pointing out how powerful the boards are. ((They)) are always watching. https://t.co/gQUEE4GzY5 
 3. Q points out that Hussein also rcvd an envelope w/white powder (is he behind the one sent to DT Jr. and sent one to himself to throw everyone off?). Q says no coincidence and response forthcoming. https://t.co/cacriSy5NR 
 4. Q says we are missing the connections, keep building the MAP, which is the key to everything they are doing, keep watching the news as things unfold because future proves past (drops). Trust the plan. This has been in the works for a while. https://t.co/wbqlFNkHA6 
 5. Is something going to happen in the ocean (tsunami) or is he talking about drinking water? He has mentioned RED OCTOBER a few times (implying the hunt for the missing sub is over) but also drank that Fiji water in a strange way. Not sure but watch for water-related news. https://t.co/66c9OIqwl5 
 6. An anon posted a screen shot of Secure Drop site and draws attention to use of Apache software for Secure Drop. Q confirms anon's post. https://t.co/qNWpD5YAgp https://t.co/F4aKDlQKbN 
 7. An anon lets Q know how being involved has given him/her new purpose. Q once again shows his/her/their compassion and appreciation for patriots who are helping in this critical time and encourages all of us to keep fighting. https://t.co/VeSnU060dj 
 8. Q warns us that the "conspiracy" push will be getting louder from all media outlet6/on all platforms. They will try to discredit. Remember...the TRUTH is on OUR side. Proof of Q's legitimacy will gain in momentum as news unfolds. Stay strong!! https://t.co/4N252kVB69 https://t.co/T7iqeoYK0z 
 9. Q posts a link to the Pledge of Allegiance. https://t.co/sjmu9bgc8K https://t.co/Gs9XDboJKZ 
 10. Q responds to anon's post about all the connections Snowden has to recent suicides of people associated with Secure Drop and Freedom of the Press. Q reminds us that John Perry Barlow (Freedom of the Press co-founder) was mentioned by Q before he was 187'ed. Is Snowden next? https://t.co/JXU1akBcU1 
 11. In my haste to post Q's latest drops re: Snowden, I inadvertently included the drop directed at @Jack (Twitter CEO). He &amp; Pelosi are in cahoots it would seem. No surprise w/all the shadow-banning of patriots. Will he remain on ((their)) side or flip? https://t.co/Hmigd2MUbc 
 12. Reposting: Q shares Aug 77 Joint Hearing on MK Ultra - Gov't (Clowns) conducting mind control. https://t.co/gSIsegP256 . Q also posts video of car that tried to ram @POTUS' motorcade https://t.co/o0ILC6GgBO . Brakes didn't work; driver was terrified. https://t.co/YKkwE4LbV9 https://t.co/a0eeEHga2T 
 13. Anon shares findings on MK Ultra history. Q asks if recent shooters had been in therapy. I recall almost EVERY mass shooter's mug shot looked like they were strung out on drugs. Need to dig more. An anon shared some old research info. Nikolas Cruz HAD rcvd therapy. https://t.co/qBCMBOMrqj 
 14. Anon shares info on cell phones going digital &amp; why digital signals alone aren't strong enough for mind control. Need to dig on which scientists were killed for work on satellite relay of cell signals. Technology classified - reserved for bad actors for nefarious reasons. https://t.co/87MiRMAh2S 
 15. Anon asks if anons are safe. Q says "Yes." Black hats scout for specific personalities predisposed to mental illness. "THERAPY" breaks their minds into programmable devices. Big Pharma pushes anti-depressants, esp. on patients w/PTSD. Blackberries more secure - HRC used them. https://t.co/9LgIgzBrdR 
 16. Q asks about SA/China/Russia. Russia &amp; China have proof of Dems' criminal acty. BHO making CYA trips around the world. @POTUS wants jobs/manufacturing in US - can't trust others making our products/technology. More proof of Q's legitimacy coming. Sharing one anon's thoughts. https://t.co/TOdj2ZBTCd 
 17. Looks like corrupt Pocahontas has been using the CFPB as a slush fund for far-left activist groups/community organizing. https://t.co/qkZCMzxSfe Mick Mulvaney says "the CFPB will no longer “push the envelope” of the law in the name of the “mission.” https://t.co/lXvGdT70XX https://t.co/H3vd9baNo0
