 Cambridge Analytica CEO Nix has ENTRAPPED politicians: “We’ll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we’ll have the whole thing recorded, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.”🤨 2/ 
 Nix bragged about digging up material on political opponents, saying Cambridge Analytica could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”.🙄 3/ 
 Nix: "Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working w/a FOREIGN company…so often we set up...fake IDs &amp; websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there’s so many options...I have lots of experience in this.”😳 4/ 
 It is ILLEGAL to *bribe* elected officials, and it's also ILLEGAL for candidates in the US to hire a FOREIGN company for campaign work. Cambridge used a US-based LLC for Team🇷🇺Trump, but reportedly still used UK-based employees. 5/
