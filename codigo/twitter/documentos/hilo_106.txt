This is Emily and Alicia Sucher. They are victims from Stoneman Douglas. This is not the first time their family has been in the middle of a gun scandal. https://t.co/R3eJfNGd45 #Qanon https://t.co/SG9tTM5U4g 
 Let's establish who they are related to. Here are Phyllis and William Sucher, they have a son named Michael. William built Century World Enterprises, one of world's largest in import/export of civilian/military equipment. #Qanon https://t.co/o5AiWk9eTV 
 When Phyllis passed away in 2007 Emily and Alicia are listed as grandchildren. So Michael is either their father or uncle. We are going to focus on him. #Qanon https://t.co/ocrKmBbmoC 
 Michael Sucher is president of [C]entury ([I]nternational) [A]rms among other businesses. #Qanon https://t.co/GFTtycRdo9 
 At the time of this article, more than 500 of the WASR-10s (Romanian made variant of the AK) imported by Century Arms were recovered in Mexico after being purchased in the U.S. That means Century's WASR-10 accounts for more than 17% of the total guns recovered in Mexico since 06.

 A gun linked to the Paris terror attacks that left 130 people dead and wounded 368 others has been traced back to a Century Arms. #Qanon https://t.co/dGW7w9emKB 
 Century Arms also sold arms to the Contras of Nicaragua at the time the 1980s Iran-Contra scandal. #Qanon https://t.co/3gHKiGJQZH

 So, what shall we say about all these things? To quote Emily Sucher, "Um, I'm not sure actually. It's just all very shocking." #Qanon https://t.co/yKrnSQ0gJA
