Finished reading through superseding Mueller Indictment on Manafort and Gates. Here’s my take: #theRESISTance #TrumpRussia https://t.co/Jz5OFPPNPX 
 This one paragraph is a culmination of #TrumpRussia starting with Manafort’s allegiance to Russia #ElectionHacking for Yanukovych; the irony that Ukraine had an “Orange Revolution” and Manafort renting property in Trump Tower for years. Roger Stone where you at? https://t.co/cLtdWBw1VC 
 More on Manafort’s experience in #ElectionHacking and capabilities that together paint a picture Tony Soprano couldn’t paint: https://t.co/Zqq33w0pxU 
 Has to be pointed out that Yanukovych, Snowden, and Assange might as well be sitting in a gilded rat cave in Russia right now, but that’s besides the point. 2005-7 is a key timeframe to understanding how #TrumpRussia came about in the first place... https://t.co/XYMQ8gR1G8 
 Facts are stubborn things. https://t.co/dm4vMYsBFq 
 Is it possible that Manafort used the same “Home Improvement” company that Russian Embassies throughout tri-state used? Using that involved Russian “immigrants” who were “cool” with taking money from Cyprus? Rinat where you at? #OperationHotSoup https://t.co/av9tcbuRrh 
 More on “home improvement” https://t.co/gwCcOqTwKP 
 Let’s not talk about Manafort’s Bannon-esque company name Leviathan, or subliminals like Global Highway, or the fact that Black Sea was set-up to be a propaganda channel - imagine, Manafort with his own Hannity shows. Global Endeavour for 500,000? Sept, 3 2013. https://t.co/bkcYEBNzZk

 “Global Endeavour in September 13’” ask yourself what is Trump doing? Miss Universe, inviting Putin, praising him, “Putin gave me a gift” meanwhile @PreetBharara files Prevezon case against Veselnitskaya from #TrumpTowerMeeting - small world am i right? https://t.co/mvPfJUsgye 
 Quick question, can somebody frame this? https://t.co/0js8SpltQo 
 The irony is that Trump‘s lawlessness and ability to surround himself with the worst kind of political operatives have given law enforcement the opportunity to #DrainTheSwamp within the #DarkMoney GOP - Manafort with Roger Stone, Ailes, and Lee Atwater helped NIXON... #TBT 
 Mueller drops this indictment same day as #CPAC2018 - Trump admitted at CPAC that he got a gift from Putin, safe to say it wasn’t Slutvana peeing on a bed? Or a loyalty pledge for 2016 perhaps? I think Mueller should ask. https://t.co/FozmVtNkHk 
 Trust me my fellow Americans, I would rather not have to tweet at 1:30AM about indictments that are a tuna sandwich away from our current @POTUS but you have to admit, what Trump and his gangsters have done is treasonous and anyone taking this seriously knows the ramifications.
