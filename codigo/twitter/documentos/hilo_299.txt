1) The Funnel gone. Now, two directions this can go: First, as my friend @Ronhill1999Hill points out, however Mulehead started, this 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 2) has not gone anywhere like planned by left. Whether Mulehead was "trying to get Trump" from beginning, about 3 mo ago he knew that was 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 3) null and void. There were NO Trump crimes to investigate. On the other hand, if he was brought in by Trump as I claim, he found himself 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 4) with a much different problem--one I suspect he really didn't think he'd have: Massive corruption trail from Podestas to Zero. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 5) Then, in the middle of that came U1 &amp; the VERY real possibility that RR could suddenly expand the scope of his charge (which he MAY have 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 6) already done. Contrary to the "fire Sessions" crowd, NO ONE knows exactly what RR tells Mulehead. 6) Either way--expanded case or not-- 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 7) Mulehead has a massive problem he really didn't expect: ALL shitroads lead to the Podestas &amp; when that road forks into dossier or U1, 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 8) EITHER WAY it goes to Cankles and Zero. Mulehead has no option here. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 9) This is where @Ronhill1999Hill 's question comes in: He asked, "If I was Mulehead, what would I do?" He does NOT want to get in U1. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 10) Whether he is corrupt or a "good cop" whom Trump has leverage on this is a no win. NO I'm not sympathetic to him, just 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 11) as a historian trying to explain what he's thinking. Either the dossier OR U1 is a scandal so big it could endanger the Republic. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 12) He's thinking, "My God, I'd have to indict a former SecState, 90% of the DNC, and probably have the former "First Black Prez" as an 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 13) indicted or unindicted co-conspirator-That would bring revolution to the streets/violence. Hell no!" Again this is what hes looking at 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 14) I'm not saying that's the case, or if it is the case, if it's not "tough toenails, enforce the law." I'm trying to have you see it . . 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 15) Through HIS eyes. So, what does he do? He can continue to pull the Manafort Podesta thread. We all know where that goes. NOT TO TRUMP. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 16) The danger to him is that he will get to the point where he cannot stop, where it's too obvious that the next step is Cankles/Zero 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 17) Meanwhile, every minute he continues to operate, RR may (if he hasn't) expand his scope for U1 &amp; that DEFINITELY implicates Cankles/Zero 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 18) So that's all option 1. 19) Option 2 is say, "We've found no evidence of Russian collusion in 2016 to make any recs at this time." 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 20) the Funnel will likely get off on technicalities, likely on a Friday before Thanksgiving, &amp; Mulehead will run away as fast as he can. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 21) Trump will be as "cleared" as Mulehead can make it. Left will go nuts. Right will go nuts. Congress will thump their chests &amp; do nothing 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 22) If Sessions ISN'T ALREADY WORKING THIS in a B-team sting, as I think/hope, then the whole thing would end with a whimper. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 23) I don't know if I'm ready to buy Ron's theory yet: Mulehead may already have so much evidence HE can be charged if he doesn't move. 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 24) And there is the strong possibility a DOJ attachment team is working this. 25) All I'm saying is today Mulehead is looking to get 
 @Ronhill1999Hill 26) as far away from this as he possibly can.
