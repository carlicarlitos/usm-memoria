1) The Faces of the 2017 Fake News Awards! #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/YcZ1z8DsA5 
 2) President Trump finally released The Highly Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards https://t.co/Vx4AqJRXKX 
 3) There are many faces of #FakeNews news. The most well known faces being those on news networks and social media. They are the pushers. Here are the pushers at CNN. https://t.co/B56MTA8qQ5 
 4) The lesser known faces of #FakeNews are the journalists who originate the stories that are pushed by all the networks. They generate an article and then all of a sudden it is on every news network and all their platforms. You know the drill. 
 5) The 2017 #FakeNewsAwards listed 10 LOSERS. I decided to go down the list and reveal the faces of the hacks who originated the stories that were pushed non stop by the pushers. 
 6) 1. Paul Krugman New York Times @paulkrugman Archived link (no clicks for NYT) to his award winning quote&gt;https://t.co/EeuElAxvXS https://t.co/YWBHZcIVki 
 7) 2. Brian Ross ABC @BrianRoss Brian used an "unnamed source" for his on-air award winning whopper that crashed the stock market. He is his own originator. A double threat kinda guy! https://t.co/LLVyVGudZi 
 8) 3. Manu Raju CNN @mkraju He posts his articles online also goes on TV to push them. His specialty is getting leaks from democrats in Congress like Adam Schiff, who deserves an honorable mention for this award. Click here&gt; https://t.co/wFKGpD0mQC https://t.co/v0rEExrHmH 
 9) 4. Zeke Miller Time @ZekeJMiller This guy apologized profusely over his MLK bust "mistake". The apology was buried of course. Standard MO. Issue fake story maybe apologize, maybe retract, maybe correct. Doesn't matter. The story was already beaten to death. https://t.co/4ySqKBtQ5D 
 10) 5. Dave Weigel WaPo @daveweigel This handsome devil is the fake Trump Rally photo tweet guy. Gotta give this charmer credit for making the list without writing an article. He deleted the tweet but it was of course too late. https://t.co/2x0BhePLb8 #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/TMO3eGr0D8 
 11) 6. Veronica Rocha CNN @VeronicaRochaLA Fish Girl's hit job used selective video editing of Trump and his pal Abe feeding fish in Japan. It made the rounds worldwide almost causing an international incident. #FakeNewsAwards Fox article&gt;https://t.co/hwJUfNtZ7Z https://t.co/wJx3GUztVX 
 12) 7. Thomas Frank CNN @ByTomFrank Thomas made the list with his concocted hit job on Mooch that got himself and two editors fired. He sometimes went on TV to push his garbage. He is at buzzpuke now. Good recap of the fallout&gt; https://t.co/dKR4dv24WZ https://t.co/0xfwpUQADH 
 13) 8. Chris Riotta Newsweak @chrisriotta A real bottom feeder. Gossip columnist tier. He's the kind of guy that will do anything without remorse because he has no credibility to lose. He happily made the list with his phony handshake snub story. #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/4PApXOCIJq 
 14) 9. Anderson Cooper CNN @andersoncooper Another on-air hit job citing "sources". Who needs a written source when you can just make one up in thin air? Not Andy! #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/MMROwGus0o 
 15) 10. Lisa Friedman NYT @LFFriedman Global warming climate change zealot who got buried by the NYT. You know it's bad when WaPo buries you. Here is the archived Wapo refutation&gt;https://t.co/s8SVALcE3S https://t.co/2iaziKI0sV 
 16) 11. THE RUSSIAN HOAX #SteeleDossier The biggest fake news story of them all! This insidious fabrication is the product of a politically weaponized DOJ and FBI, used to try to unseat a duly elected President in an attempt to thwart the will of The People. #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/nXU4WNP6VB 
 17) 1-10 have been thoroughly refuted. Apologies, retractions, corrections, firings have ensued, and most importantly decades of credibility has been lost thanks to President Donald J. Trump. #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/gk9VvPwUPy 
 18) Number 11 on the list will be dealt with soon.... https://t.co/NmwlTZOQFJ 
 19) I'd like to recommend using web archive sites when you share #FakeNews articles. It deprives them of clicks and gives satisfaction. Sometime I let them slide if the article is pro Trump. Archiving sites also get around subscriptions. Just plug in article url and viola! 
 20) Keep fighting and countering the #FakeNews narrative every day, but make sure to spend more of your time spreading the good news, especially on the economy. Be of good cheer and know that every day they grow weaker and we grow stronger. #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/7lEqSGuuiB
