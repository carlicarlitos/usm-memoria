🔥KUSH🔥 THREAD: #Qatar claims to have EVIDENCE of “illicit influence” by the UAE on Jared Kushner &amp; other Trump associates, including details of SECRET MEETINGS, but decided not to give info to Mueller for fear of retaliation from Trump‼️ 1/ https://t.co/qk4I4sRLXH 
 Mueller already was probing attempts by the UAE to " buy political influence" by supporting Trump’s campaign.🤔 Then *after* #Qatar refused to bail out Kush’s 666 Fifth Ave properly, Trump sided w/the UAE &amp; #SaudiArabia AGAINST Qatar.🤨 2/ #Corruption https://t.co/wYN1OSShu6 
 George Nader — a Lebanese-American pal of Erik Prince, who’s been pushing pro-UAE interests — and #Republican DONOR Elliott Broidy, participated in the meetings.🤔 Nader FLIPPED and is cooperating w/Mueller‼️😎 3/ 
 In addition to the UAE, Broidy was also angling to influence DOJ to drop its probe of #Malaysia’s 1MDB👉🏼suspected of #MoneyLaundering and other alleged crimes.🤨 4/ https://t.co/7h3bwykBcO 
 Broidy is also linked to Rick Gates’ movie production company. Gates’ partner pleaded GUILTY to #MoneyLaundering, fraud &amp; identity theft.🙄 Gates’ co-producers funneled cash to a DARK MONEY political nonprofit👈🏼Broidy served on its board‼️ 5/ https://t.co/okKlldjDqz 
 “Bad news” Broidy previously pleaded GUILTY for illegally funneling money to NY pension fund authorities.🤔 DO YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS HEADING⁉️ Mueller is probing ALL of the DIRTY MONEY that illegally flowed into #GOP and Trump campaign coffers‼️😎6/ https://t.co/wpASV8jr0T 
 Qatari officials met w/Trump officials in Jan/Feb. Trump endorsed the UAE/Saudi blockade in June AFTER #Qatar bailed on Kush.🤔 Qataris also met w/FBI Dir Chris Wray, but “never shared” their info about UAE's influence on the administration, likely b/c MUELLER ALREADY KNEW.😎 7/ 
 Broidy is KNOWN to have MASSIVE business ties w/UAE. #Qatar says Broidy influenced the Trump administration &amp; claims to have EVIDENCE showing his connection to the UAE.🤔 8/ #FARA https://t.co/1RL8C79Gfw 
 FOURTEEN lobbying &amp; PR firms filed #FARA as agents of Qatar, UAE or Saudi Arabia since Trump's blockade endorsement.🤨 Mercury lobbied in favor of Qatar, Podesta Group lobbied for Saudi Arabia, and BOTH worked w/Manafort for the pro-#Russia party in Ukraine.🙄 9/ 
 Friends, this is just a SMALL glimpse of the SHADY players in our political system, with MANY foreign agents NEVER filing #FARA. Even worse, #CitizensUnited allows ANONYMOUS &amp; UNLIMITED cash into the political system👉🏼opened the floodgates for #corruption‼️🤬 10/ 
 The #SteeleDossier warned that #Russia🇷🇺was a smokescreen for Trump’s #corruption in other countries.🤨 Notice that this latest twist in Mueller’s probe involves countries OTHER than Russia⁉️ That’s b/c Mueller’s investigation is GLOBAL‼️😎 /end #MuellerTime
