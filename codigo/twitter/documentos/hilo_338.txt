#unhackthevote Devin Nunes A Candidate His Candidate Website A Trojan Horse The Story of how Devin Nunes and other GOP may have been compromised!! Thread 
 In May of 2017 vulnerabilities were discovered on one of Devin Nunes' campaign websites. The campaign website https://t.co/8g8vAk1YYB had apparently been infected with a virus that caused some internal pages to be indexed by Google, in Russian. https://t.co/jHXg0DHx6B 
 The full report on this discovery is here: https://t.co/f6ounoGNgZ. The author of the report notified the Nunes campaign of these vulnerabilities on May 19, 2017. 
 Shortly thereafter, it seemed as if the problem had been resolved. The url devinnunes[.]net was redirected to https://t.co/45riabJy09, hosted at SquareSpace. 
 The https://t.co/8g8vAk1YYB site was apparently gone. https://t.co/QBh6CFYVCn 
 But was the problem really resolved? We had a closer look. 
 It would have been the easiest thing in the world to delete ALL the files related to the now-defunct devinnunes[.]net website, then do simple domain forwarding with a URL redirect. 
 You do not need a website to forward a domain to another domain. It is done all the time. This could have been fixed in minutes. Why wasn’t it? https://t.co/57UWc0vT4D 
 When we navigated directly to one of the urls that Google had indexed last May, we found that the supposed XML file is still exactly where it was before the site was "cleaned up". 
 Instead of deleting the site entirely, whoever was in control of https://t.co/QCtaR4ANRm left the spammy files in place, even after being notified of their existence. 
 This file that google indexed last May is not actually an XML file. Clicking on the link briefly displays a (mainly) Russian language html page: https://t.co/atwQjWuE4j 
 Then it redirects the visitor to a Russian air ticket broker. https://t.co/YxVEbS68se 
 The site wasn't cleaned up at all. Normal traffic was simply redirected so the spammy files were no longer visible to the normal user or indexed by search engines. 
 Lets be clear. When they were notified as to the hosting of these files they immediately changed their website. They changed it in a way that makes no sense in securing it. They changed it in a way to hide the Trojan Horse while giving the appearance they had fixed it. Why? 
 This made us curious about what other files may still exist at this url. We checked the service Virus Total to see whether malicious code on https://t.co/8g8vAk1YYB had been detected and reported by others. And indeed it had. 
 Not only is the ghost of devinnunes[.]net is still alive, it is serving code that is MUCH more malicious than simple Russian travel spam. https://t.co/SOR2e7MGmz 
 We downloaded the file that VirusTotal alerted us to. What we found was very disturbing. 
 Disguised as a JPEG image file, it contains a Visual Basic script that downloads code from a domain called https://t.co/FZyR2t5zxK, executes it on the user's computer, then destroys its own traces. Why is that code STILL THERE many months later? https://t.co/ilGrbGK4B0 
 What could a malicious file like this be used for? Here are the warnings about this file. It's a Trojan Agent, for sure, and most virus scanners mark it as a BRRT type. It's a serious threat to anyone running Windows. https://t.co/AWEn5vHyoa 
 This particular type of virus is especially frightening and dangerous. It is built to steal information from anyone whose computer is infected by it. 
 In short, this is exactly the type of file that is used for spear phishing - a targeted hack that compromises personal data, including emails and address books. https://t.co/BtC2jVJL0Q 
 Here is a description of what this type of Trojan virus is used for. https://t.co/AOZ2pI5Uvr 
 If an unsuspecting victim received an email containing a link that would initiate a download of this file, that person's computer would most likely be compromised. 
 Did Nunes’s emails get hacked, did his Address Book get hacked?, were emails then sent out to other GOP in a Spear Phishing campaign being that Nunes was a trusted contact to these people. The damage that could have occurred as this spread is deeply concerning!! 
 The continued existence of this file brings up some serious questions. How could this have happened to Devin Nunes' campaign website? Who was managing this site? Why did the malicious code stay in place, nearly nine months after it was reported to the campaign? 
 To answer these questions we dug even deeper. We had a look at the computer hosting the https://t.co/8g8vAk1YYB website. Its IP address comes back to an Microsoft Azure server. Who controls this server? What else is hosted there? This is what we found. https://t.co/0HNnUvALtA 
 North Star Campaigns? Drink Stocks? Who are these people? What do they have to do with Devin Nunes? 
 Stay tuned. This rabbit hole is about to get crazy deep.
