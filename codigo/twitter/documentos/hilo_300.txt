1. Ok. BIG THREAD incoming.. PLEASE watch and retweet my video explaining this in detail: https://t.co/SkSKWMZZHs This is a story of Rick Gates, Robert Mueller, Jack Burkman, Glenn Selig, and.... Seth Rich???? If this piques your interest, please keep reading.... 
 2. First the cast of characters: Glenn Selig, a former journalist and high powered D.C. connected PR rep and PR firm owner, who represented Burkman, Blagojevic, and Rick Gates. Jack Burkman of Seth Rich fame, who stated that Putin ordered the hit on Seth, and lots of other lies. 
 3. Lets go back in time a bit: On 11/27/17 Selig releases a Press Release stating that Jack Burkman (still in favor with the Rich family) is having a Press conference with the family: https://t.co/PvFylGYiiJ 
 4. On 4/10/17, he and his firm release another PR in regards to Jack Burkman asking Wikileaks for more information on Seth. This occurred in the beginning of the debaucle with Wikilekas/Wheeler, etc. https://t.co/UokTJOWhll 
 5. On 5/6/17, The Daily Beast releases this article: https://t.co/emRVW1v9Wb in it, they say: "The Daily Beast was approached in February by the public relations firm representing Burkman and his investigation, but chose not to write a story. Glenn Selig.. (cont) 
 6. ...(cont) who runs the PR firm, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that Burkman didn’t have access to Rich’s computer either, and put out a press release demanding proof from Wheeler that Rich had ties to WikiLeaks. “This was a surprise to us as well,” 
 7. On 6/20/17 we learn that Burkman was behind the George Washington U study into Seth Rich death. The group finds it was a serial killer. I don't think we need to go further with that: https://t.co/jdoE55TgAR 
 8. On 8/2/17, we also hear about the death reenactment funded by Burkman, Aaron Rich weighs in: (Bear with me) https://t.co/88r9HiPNKF 
 9. Fastforward to 10/30/2017- Right before the indictment is announced publicly, Rick Gates (of Manafort team) announces that he has hired Selig as his PR representative: https://t.co/mi3IW1ve1u 
 10. On 12/20/2017, Jack Burkman holds a fundraiser to raise money for Gates' legal expenses. It is poorly attended. Gates, still on house arrest, appears via recorded message: https://t.co/vKTsklhvtp 
 11. On 1/9/2018, Jack Burkman is attacked outside of his home. As per Burkman, a black SUV is parked in the driveway, and a man with a mask jumps out and accosts Burkman and sprays him with pepper spray. Selig releases statement on the attack as well. https://t.co/Q1BRr9nopt 
 12. A few days before, Gates is scolded by the judge for appearing via recorded message at the fundraiser given by Burkman. Burkman releases a statement through Selig on 1/16/18: https://t.co/g7L0sv5QX4 
 13. Also on 1/16/18, Rick Gates is released from house arrest and is free with some restrictions: https://t.co/pysBRbGzdr 
 14. Busy news day, the 16th was. On the same day we learn that the trial for Gates and Manafort will likely be postponed until right before mid terms, becase Gates attorneys (apparantely lagging behind) need more time: https://t.co/E7N6AIpVP3 
 15. On 1/17/18, a report is quietly released, that back in November of 2017, Mueller brought on the same cyber expert from the FBI who worked on the original Guccifer investigation into Clintons emails.. Things are starting to get more interesting.. https://t.co/iMlR6pYJ8D 
 16. On 1/20/2018, Glenn Selig is killed in a terrorist attack in Afghanistan. This is just about two weeks after Burkman is attacked in his driveway: https://t.co/GoqQrtL4vo 
 17. On 1/23/18, Gates has a new representative talking to Muellers office all of a sudden, who isn't listed as an attorney. His name? Tim Green. He has repped lots of very high profile clients, including being the mastermind behind Dennis Hasterts plea. https://t.co/SkckgZkJji 
 18. On 1/26/2018, we hear that Burkman is out and about calling for an investigation into Selig's death as a "government" conspiracy, and states he is now also afraid for his life: https://t.co/jpbvzXN4xw 
 19. On 2/1/18- Gates attorneys inform the court they wish to step down from his case. There is no way to know why, because the reasons are under seal. https://t.co/QGqFLiMoCV It is now assumed that Gates is working a deal with the special counsel. 
 20. What does it all mean? Goodness only knows. I am still working on a firm speculative theory. But I do know one thing--- 
 21. Burkman works with Selig all through the Seth Rich murder in a VERY controversial way full of twists and turns. Selig then takes on Gates as a client in the Russia SC investigation, where Mueller has brought in someone who specialized in the 1st Guccifer hack. The ACTUAL hack 
 22. Burkman gets attacked in his driveway, Selig DIES, Gates brings on a new highpowered attorney and his step down and SEAL the reasons why.... Do you believe in coincidences?? Me neither... /End 
 We should expect to be able to read his plea deal in the coming days... https://t.co/bWpfrOQiP5
