The announcement by the #POTUS that he is replacing National Security Advisor LTG H R #McMaster with #Ambassador #JohnBolton is great news. This is an over due change that I wish Mr #Trump had made long ago. 
 John #Bolton is probably the most experienced and capable #diplomat in America today. He will be coming in at a critical time when the #President needs solid advice on dealing with #Iran, #NorthKorea, #Russia, #ISIS, and an array of other threats. 
 As for LTG #McMaster, I thank him for his service and wish him the best in the future. That said, there were issues, as I see them, regarding the #General’s tenure. 
 Ltg #McMaster was an #Obama acolyte who shared the former president’s blind spot on #Islam. He was never able to get beyond the @BarackObama era talking points about Islam and how it is a great #religion that has been hijacked by #radicals. 
 Unquestionably the majority of the #Muslims in the world are not suicide bombers but #McMaster was never able to fully accept that there were millions who hate us because they consider us #infidels. Either he never read the #Quran and #Hadith or he was just ignoring reality. 
 The #general also refused to ferret out and eliminate the #DeepState holdovers from the #Obama administration. You do not have to look too far to find the “Leakers” in the #WhiteHouse. They are predominately these @BarackObama loyalists who #McMaster would not fire. 
 People #McMaster had no problem firing?people like #EzraCohen, a true #conservative and #warrior, because he did not agree with the #general’s advice to there #POTUS. 
 General #McMaster disagreed with the #President on key issues and irritated the president with his pedantic and tutorial briefing style. @realDonaldTrump, The Commander in Chief, does not like being talked down to apparently. No surprise there. 
 Mr Trump has been abundantly clear that he wants to withdraw from the JCPOA (#IranDeal) but #McMaster has been an impediment to that effort. 
 #AmbassadorBolton will not be eager to go to #war as some people fear. He is a reasonable man who realizes that the use of our #military must be done only when careful consideration + thought has gone into all possible options. #potus #bolton 
 #AmbassadorBolton will work well with the #President because he will be respected by the @realDonaldTrump and practical in his advice. Mr #Bolton and I would disagree on many #socialissues but he and I agree on almost every #nationalsecurity issue.
