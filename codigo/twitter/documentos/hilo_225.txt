Woah. GOP lawmakers in Georgia-@buzzbrockway (a candidate for SOS), @ed_setzler, &amp; @brucethompsonga--want to pass #SB403 giving the SOS the power and obligation to program all voting equipment in the state, creating a centralized point of attack for hackers! #KillTheBill 1/ https://t.co/oDaoCJawq6 
 2/ Here is a link to #SB403, which would consolidate the programming of all voting machines throughout the state in the office of Secretary of State. Again, Republican @buzzbrockway is a proponent of #SB403 AND a candidate for Secretary of State. https://t.co/XRVsTgTER3 https://t.co/N0xzLPw07C 
 3/ The current statute, 21-2-50 (15) says that the SOS "shall perform all the duties imposed by this chapter," including "To develop, program, build, &amp; review ballots for use by counties and municipalities on direct recording electronic (DRE) voting systems in use in the state" https://t.co/1by9GCzjS7 
 4/ Thus, as revised by #SB403, the statute would say that the SOS "shall perform all the duties imposed by this chapter," including "To develop, program, build, &amp; review ballots for use by counties and municipalities on voting systems in use in the state." 
 5/ In other words, #SB403 wld stick Georgia w/ ANOTHER centralized election system. Remember how well that worked out in the run up 2 the GA06 election w/ the massive breach of the centralized election management system at GA's centralized Election Center? https://t.co/F6ZeNkGz3D 
 6/ To be sure, the centralized Election Center at Kennesaw has apparently been closed due to the fallout from the scandal, which included a wiped election server. https://t.co/ICm7gD179v 
 7/ But creating another centralized Election Center--this time within the office of Secretary of State, which is unfortunately often tainted by strong partisanship--is hardly the answer to quell the legitimate concerns of many Georgia voters. 
 8/ Politicians like @buzzbrockway claim to hate "conspiracy theories." What they fail to understand is how their own conduct in defending and/or implementing an insecure &amp; centralized system within their OWN exclusive control directly leads to legitimate concerns &amp; even alarm. 
 9/ These concerns are not "conspiracy theories." They are objectively reasonable reactions to objectively problematic policies. Voters aren't mind readers, @buzzbrockway. You may have great intentions, but voters can't see your intentions. They can see only your policies. 
 10/ So if you want to avoid what you refer to as "conspiracy theories, " you should enact policies that don't require voters to have "blind faith" in members of the opposite party with respect to their votes. Come up with a system that does not require blind faith. 
 11. Neither party should have to blindly trust the other with respect to their votes. That is unreasonable. That is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Come up with a transparent evidence-based voting system, and watch the so-called "conspiracy theories" melt away.

 13. P.S. @buzzbrockway is upset bc he thinks I'm suggesting he wrote #SB403. I'm sorry if I created that impression. He did not write it &amp; is not an official sponsor. But he supports it &amp; has dismissed concerns about it as illegitimate "conspiracy theories." He wants to be SOS. 
 14. P.P. S. - Ps call these legislators and POLITELY (no swearing, etc.) tell them that you want them to OPPOSE #SB403. Bruce Thompson (404) 656-0065 Buzz Brockway 678-895-9064 Ed Setzler 404.630.8452 David Ralston 404.656.5020 John Meadows 404.656.5141 Jon Burns 404.656.5052
