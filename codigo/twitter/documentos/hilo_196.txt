&lt;Thread&gt; ðŸš¨Attention #Resistance! After following the Suggestions from @SpockResists below, dont forget to change your Search Settings as well! Instructions BelowðŸ‘‡ Then let's talk about what "Shaddowbanning" is Exactly &amp; how to Recognize it! #Censorship #1A #DisplaySensitive https://t.co/E53eri9Htb 
 2. First off, As you can see here when I search for my Friend @SpockResists under the people tab, @Twitter does not turn up any results -but he defintely exists! To Solve this Click the Three Dots to the Right of the Search Bar. #SensitiveContentBan https://t.co/zRsxVrbDWO 
 3. This display has two settings. Uncheck the "Hide Sensitive Content" Feature. https://t.co/mvfX92qxvb 
 4.Go back to your Search&amp; VoilÃ  he magically appears again! Crazy Right? So what does this Mean Moving Forward? Is this due to a new feature Twitter Included Monday with their New Rules? Why are Innocuous #Resistance accts suddenly being hidden as Sensitive Content by @Twitter? https://t.co/ccimrXnKvF 
 5. The Simple Answer is- there seems to be no true Rhyme or Reason as to who's acct is deemed "Sensitive Content" Those effected seem Randomly Impacted by this Phenomenon But, to learn more about what exactly a #Shadowban is anyway Start Here ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/pTwYgszMXq 
 6. To sum up, a #Shadowban is when your Tweets become hidden from those who do not follow you, making you rather unsearchable in Hashtag &amp; People Searches Here's an example of what comes up when I search for myself, (as I am currently Shadowbanned) vs what normally shows up. https://t.co/l744fFWAGP 
 7. Yet, users are not given any rationale as to why they have been #Shadowbanned I never received an email or notif explaining a ToS violation or what "content" was flagged We are given little recourse to appeal this action while @Twitter is still working on an Appeal Process ðŸ˜’ https://t.co/StIr1xpSqO 
 8. For those who have followed myself, &amp; others in #Resistance groups a while, We do not use Profane or Violent Language, or Images &amp; Media that could be construed as such We are Dedicated to Spreading Accurate, Up to Fate Information &amp; CTAs to help Effect Positive Change 
 9. But Despite Staying well within Twitter's ToS &amp; Rules as far as we Know, This article outlines what little control users have over whether their content is marked as "Sensitive", &amp; just how Undefined "Sensitive" Content is on @Twitter #Censorship https://t.co/cqrz5czSox https://t.co/s2NpAtLxFd 
 10. Overall, Being Marked as "Sensitive Content" Stifles our voice within the @Twitter community, making it much harder for our Messages to have an Impact &amp; to Engage with new Followers This has happened to Several Accts Simultaneously within #TheResistance in the last few days 
 11. #TheResistance accounts we know of that have been effected by this ban as of late are as follows: @gettinnoticedmo @BeSeriousUSA @EdKrassen @EzraBridger2017 @TheSWPrincess @Indy_Resists @Guinan2017 @SpockResists @1Jedi_Rey @AgentScullyGR @WomanResistorNC @finnick_Resists 
 12. @NatCookResists @AlexMunday_2017 @KellieResists @chappie_cat @TrinityResists @Elastigirl2018 @Havok_2018 @chillibeanboy @BuffyResists If you or anyone you know has also been effected by a #Shadowban and/or labeled "Sensitive Content" in the last few days pls add them below! 
 13. No one has seen so many #Resistance accounts hit by a #Shadowban or Hidden at one time. This may be an Unintentional Side Effect of Twitter's new Rules going into effect this Monday -but it throttles ones ability to #Resist Effectively on this platform. So what can we do? 
 14. First we can #SpeakOut! Use the Suggestions here to Contact @TwitterSupport &amp;tell them that Stifling our Voices for Unclear Reasons with Little Recourse Violates our #FreeSpeech! Our Collective Voices are Vital to a free Society! H/t @TheSWPrincess https://t.co/zB04CXWeeL 
 15. Also for a simpler way to check if you &amp; your friends are #Shadowbanned use this link ðŸ‘‡ Feel free to add people you find that are Shadowbanned in the replies, @Twitter needs to recognize the Scope of this Problem! H/t @Boba_Cup https://t.co/aDC4PW36Rp 
 16. To end, Social Media &amp; the Internet as a Whole are key Communications Utilities that many of us now take for granted. At this time in our Country it is Vital for us to Disseminate Truthful Info &amp; Build Bridges as we Continue on the Path to Preserve our #Democracy #FreeSpeech https://t.co/gSdHLQDM3y
