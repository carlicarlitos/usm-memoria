That's the auditors and legal counsel who didn't go in there to retrieve the data in December 2015 when @harryfoxdavies wrote breakthrough first @guardian report. Why??? https://t.co/J3hXg1x2Cy 
 Nor did @facebook turn up with auditors &amp; legal counsel when @HNSGR &amp; @MikaelKrogerus wrote groundbreaking piece a year later that explained how it was done... https://t.co/AkrDUpjByv 
 Or when we published this. @facebook refused to answer questions &amp; acknowledge data breach in any way... https://t.co/owK252kvlL 
 And when @Schwartzesque published this. Still, @facebook denied &amp; denied &amp; denied.... https://t.co/u0inUc1Nud 
 As they denied &amp; denied &amp; denied when @chrisinsilico leaked me the documents that formed the basis of this: https://t.co/KKZUJ81NE9 
 It took journalists &amp; academics &amp; researchers on 2 continents 2 years to FINALLY force @facebook to acknowledge &amp; actually investigate. It took the @nytimes to get involved, probably. Because remember @facebook is not global, it's American. Big difference https://t.co/hX9nbjZJyV
