☎️ Just a friendly reminder that the Obama admin #wiretapped over 20 reporters at the @AP including their personal phones and general lines. Have you forgotten that @CNN @MSNBC @abcnews @nytimes but surely his admin wouldn’t do that to @realDonaldTrump 🙄 #FISAMemo https://t.co/eDLeHBL3Dn 
 @AP @CNN @MSNBC @abcnews @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @littlecarrotq @BabeReflex_8 @TuckerCarlson @passionchica @Avery1776 @rising_serpent @nameredacted5 @BasedBasterd @DaveNYviii How quickly we forget #MSM “sheer volume of records obtained” and “overboard collection” oddly @AP removed this letter from their site. #FISAMemo #DisclosuresTribunal #NunesMemo https://t.co/xaVtLZWPNr 
 It’s funny that #Brennan is so angry with #Nunes probably just because he misses having the power to lead the #WitchHunt on journalists that reported negatively on Obama. Didn’t @CNN just give him a job? 😂🤣 #NunesMemo #wikileaks https://t.co/JZ4jR4FRCj https://t.co/YFv9HmLIkN 
 Nothing to see here just Obama admin getting a subpoena for @JamesRosenTV emails (totally normal 🤦🏼‍♀️) for journalists and American citizens right? #MSM failed miserably to report this because they relished @FoxNews being attacked cc: @rising_serpent #FisaGate https://t.co/bXXo5YfrKu 
 Let’s not forget how “out of control” @SharylAttkisson was for daring to report on #FastAndFurious right @EricHolder but you took care of that, just download spyware on her work computer so she doesn’t make you look bad again😤 cc: @RealJamesWoods #FISAgate #WeRemember https://t.co/cATo4yWTSn 
 #CheatSheet of all the people Obama admin spied on, but maybe @IsraeliPM @Snowden @xychelsea @SenateGOP @SenateDems etc are all #RUSSIAN 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 @TheDemocrats outrage and denial about illegal spying is this years greatest joke #FISAMemo #WeRemember https://t.co/53zLx1ZwIc 
 The exact moment @cnn fell in love with Clapper 🤣 https://t.co/tffvI9IyYX
