 Maxxed individual donations most of the time for candidates. Tens of thousands each to the state parties. Hundreds of thousands to the national party. 
 That's *just* the #Mercers (not exhaustive), per Center for Reponsive Politics' https://t.co/mOPNFxUeKC utility (I donated $25 because I do not have Mercer money, but this kind of sunshine is not free). #CambridgeAnalytics has many anomalies in its campaign finance reporting. 
 #RobertMercer's donations to the Super PACs listed above run the gamut from a modest $50K to Black Americans For A Better Future (so far this year) to $10s of millions. And those funds and bundled in other PACs, and distributed into your representative's campaign coffers. 
 There are many more. I listed only entities who received #Mercer funds within their last election cycle or current cycle. 
 Now to *some* of #CambridgeAnalytica's vendor/recipient data. https://t.co/JMrKkwGSF2
