My first thread. #QAnon #MAGA #WWG1WGA #EnjoyTheShow #PatriotsUnited #TheRainMakers The other night, May 20th at 1:17 I posted this tweet... pretty much just another night: saving the world one tweet at a time and seeking justice for Seth. https://t.co/MfMYCBbFFn https://t.co/jgUw4Oi0pD 
 The next morning I read President Trump's tweets like a good American. I saw similarities to my tweet 8 hours earlier and the wheels started turning. "There's no off position on the genius switch" https://t.co/2PlFnHbIXm 
 Kind of in jest and a little freaked I posted this tweet about the similarities and @POTUS "responding" to my tweet. Ha ha! https://t.co/NQU9gxYaMN https://t.co/Oy4LwV2EwI 
 I started thinking, if @POTUS really responded to my tweet, what about Seth? I realized he couldn't mention Seth for obvious reasons but I kept thinking about it. I remembered that Q told us "misspellings matter". Q said "Learn" so I did.... back in March. https://t.co/77pHY103Gz 
 Q said they can't come right out with the brutal truth so we were told what to look for. Misspelled words. Missing letters, extra letters, miscapitalized words, etc... So I looked, it took a minute but there it was.... I saw SCR and my jaw dropped. https://t.co/Cx7izIncth 
 I started #AmericanHeroSethRich in 2016 and think of Seth every day. My hero list is very short. I knew instantly what SCR meant: Seth Conrad Rich. I updated my tweet. https://t.co/emBdiN82Ru https://t.co/7WH3QlY8GS 
 I'm shadow banned but the tweet started to get some traction. @DocRock1007 mentioned it in a thread and exposure grew. It got picked up by a web site that did a great synopsis of Seth and ending with my tweet! https://t.co/xYEXM8o8xR 
 Was this even real? Pinch me! https://t.co/8JZmez0Mu8 https://t.co/xGfE4zlJW2 
 I updated my graphic to show the similar wording in Trump's tweet about the DNC server "in the center of" the hack hoax / all the Corruption... https://t.co/m1yog3PS7O 
 The best part? Feeling like I made a difference and helped President Trump raise awareness and seek justice for Seth. My personal hero. Trump connected with me. Sitting here at a place I call nowhere. Message sent and received! Decoded and spread! https://t.co/BW6t2LjI5u https://t.co/chg6D8TReb 
 The icing on the cake? Within hours and right on "Q" the Boston Globe did a story on Trump's typos and how they're a joke pointed at deplorables. Classic deflection can only mean one thing.... a nerve was struck! https://t.co/L2Hvb8NspF 
 MSM mocking birds couldn't let Trump draw a connection between the DNC and #SethRich. Why? All roads from Russia lead back to the real source: Seth Rich. https://t.co/H354VINkVm https://t.co/KeBnpDwp0K 
 Those who followed me before may recall my tag line and pinned tweet: "Hillary Clinton blamed everyone in the world except the man most responsible for her defeat: Seth Rich" https://t.co/ToT5wVM1a5 
 I tried to get a Seth's birthday trending as #SethRichDay, I suggested Seth have a chapter in history books and that his name be known in every household. I nominated Seth for "Man of the Year" - (With him we'd have her}. https://t.co/gfmlTMhhD7 
 I hounded Donna Brazile relentlessly. I was brutal. I stopped and made a public apology when she dedicated her book (in part) to "Seth Rich, patriot" https://t.co/3e6wgozTWt 
 I was there at 4am the morning "Seth Rich" and "John Podesta" were trending together before tw spotted it. Me? I screen capped it. https://t.co/JNXPz0YRB0 
 Does Trump know me and how I felt about Seth? Nah, it's all a coincidence. We now know that President Trump is aware of #SethRich's connection to the DNC server. He told us. He allowed me to bring that message to you and I am grateful. I love our President and love you all! https://t.co/LqlVTUGlOq 
 p.s. I originally responded to a reply to one of Trump's tweets. Yes, I'm up at the wee hours of the morning doing battle with trolls to defend our pres and what is right. It's how I roll. Of course I included Seth in my tweet.... the rest is history! https://t.co/MfMYCBbFFn https://t.co/8yJerOPiR5 
 President Trump knows about Seth. #TrumpKnowsAboutSeth #SethRichDNC #SCRDNC #SethRich #QAnon #MAGA #QToldUs https://t.co/uwQ2CzjW9w
