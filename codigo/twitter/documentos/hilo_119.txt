Oh General Flynn. You knew it was going to cost you your security clearance and pension, so you lied. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/lOxxxwcmmF 
 Flynn's partners responded partially to @OversightDems request for information, proving he violated federal law. They've informed Mueller. https://t.co/rdv6cI8nOu 
 @OversightDems Even worse, Flynn's partners indicate that the deal is alive today, and he may have pushed it during his 24 days as America's NatSec Advisor https://t.co/0rAulkvc9j 
 @OversightDems Flynn's partner ACU haven't disclosed any lobbying of the Trump administration since the election, but say it's part of their "toolkit" https://t.co/ouZqj6J3f7 
 @OversightDems Flynn got a $25k check, didn't cash it for some reason &amp; got paid for travel expenses, didn't disclose any of the payments on security forms https://t.co/kZAS6mKLew 
 @OversightDems We've had proof that Russia paid Flynn since March, which he also materially omitted from security clearances https://t.co/J3g3GQQ7Bn 
 @OversightDems And we found out about Flynn's $100 billion dollar deal in June, when a Senator said he was cooperating with the FBI https://t.co/x6NcOS6cVK 
 @OversightDems Flynn could lose his military pension because of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which also applies to Trump. https://t.co/YHXLA7TY1J 
 @OversightDems #Republican ethics lawyer @RWPUSA says Flynn should be stripped of his military rank for violating the constitution https://t.co/REPRSt20Pl 
 @OversightDems @RWPUSA Here's the letter @OversightDems and @HFACDemocrats sent to Flynn's business partners https://t.co/CIkP6nIHMe 
 @OversightDems @RWPUSA @HFACDemocrats WSJ reports that Flynn used his NSA job to promote a Russian nuclear deal he was paid to rep inside the White House https://t.co/WpIFMPdQNx
