1/ My theory on why @rogerkver acts the way he does. I think the root cause is that he doesn't understand #Bitcoin on a sufficient technical level 
 2/ Any politician can make grand promises of solutions to problems, and expect others to make them happen. But building and delivering is what counts 
 3/ If Bitcoin is to become a foundation for human and machine peer-to-peer interaction that nobody can control or censor, each user needs to easily be able to run a full node 
 4/ To make it possible for all users of Bitcoin to run a full node, the resource requirements regarding CPU, memory and bandwidth must be kept low 
 5/ Users that don't run a full node are not "peers" in a peer-to-peer network, but must instead rely on trusted third parties as intermediaries 
 6/ Running a full node is the only way to send bitcoins and check that you have been payed, without having to rely on someone else. Completely trustless 
 7/ Increasing resource requirements for running a full node, e.g. by increasing the blocksize, jeopardizes the opportunity to be a "peer" in the network, while simultaneously jeopardizing decentralization 
 8/ Decentralization, and that everyone can use Bitcoin completely trustless as a "peer" in the network is paramount, and must under no circumstances be compromised
