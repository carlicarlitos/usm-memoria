Not 'new' news, but retrospective comparisons to #TrumpRussia are pretty déjà vu. In 1987: Donald Trump, Wharton Dean Donald Palmer and former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan named in scheme to divert Wharton funds to Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Big scandal then. 1/4 https://t.co/8VV3t9Rbj3 
 President Ronald Reagan claimed he had no knowledge of their scheme. Wharton secretary acted as link between Wharton Dean, Russell Palmer, and Oliver North. 2/4 Link to Daily Pennsylvanian full article pdf (from 4/2/1987): https://t.co/9jlvUSNIoz 
 Oliver North used money from Donald Trump to buy ammunition given to U.S. enemy as part of Ronald Reagan's Iran-Contra affair. Oliver North became fall guy. All should have been charged/convicted as well. #TrumpScandals #PatternsOfBehavior #NotAPatriot 3/4 https://t.co/RN0yej7M6B 
 So, does this lead Trump to think he can get away with it like Pres. Reagan did? Not so sure. Lessons from 1987 hopefully were learned by prosecutors then &amp; passed forward to people like Robert Mueller today. Hope Trump charged in #TrumpRussia affair. 4/4 https://t.co/Llibv5wB58
