#QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (1) OK #QAnon PEOPLE, MAY I HAVE A MINUTE OF YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? I think I stumbled upon something REALLY, REALLY HUGE. It regards the meaning of Q, and possibly the identity of the people behind it. It has to do with this drop, here: https://t.co/iMIU1VVpIj 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (2) Ever since I started following Q in late November, I took for granted the accepted interpretation: Q is related to DOE "Q Clearance" - and the connection to the U1 scandal etc. BUT https://t.co/Zjvopx2SaU 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (3) An ex-marine friend and researcher - who wishes to remain anonymous - found something which is BIG, IMO. AND MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE THE TRUTH BEHIND IT. Please refer to the crumb, again. https://t.co/PQuVdJVWLP 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (4) If you look in the structure of No Such Agency, you find the Associate Directorate for Security and Counterintelligence - or THE Q GROUP. https://t.co/RyziTHIUwm 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (5) Here's the link to the full structure of the Agency: https://t.co/FOlUWfypem 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (6) Who is helping POTUS? What agency is at WAR with Clowns? https://t.co/x90JsP5kBM 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (7) Now, we have talked a lot about Snow White being a treasonous Clown operator. So, look at THAT: https://t.co/Bv4lrb08IY 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (8) Here's the full article: https://t.co/PxekLAq9Bm 
 #QAnon #GreatAwakening #TheStorm (9) More than ever, I quote Q: TRUST ROGERS!!! /END https://t.co/Xgtw3qDHHd 
 ADDENDUM: Let me make this clear: THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION of who knows what first. But two days ago I wrote about the Q team, saying it had to do with Q clearance from DOE and NOBODY came to correct me and give me the right clue. But now a lot of people claim it was obvious. ðŸ‘¾ 
 SO, I GOT PERMISSION TO REVEAL THAT THIS GREAT CATCH IS THE WORK OF @dlfield who is an "acronym freak" and - it turns out - a very good researcher, too. Follow him, patriots. He doesn't post much. But when he does, it's gold!!! 
 @threadreaderapp please, unroll! Thanks! 
 Today, for the first time, I'm getting a lot of bad vibe from people here. People complaining, criticizing me, trying to tell me what to write or not... I will block them all!!! They will not spoil the wonderful experience I'm having of interacting with the patriots. ðŸ‘¾
