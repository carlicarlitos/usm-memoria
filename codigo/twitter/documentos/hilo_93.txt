This morning, I want you to indulge me by reading two articles in sequence. The first is by @MarkMazzettiNYT. It starts with this (very true) statement: "The release of the memo mattered less than #releasethememo." https://t.co/LnisYCxT0D 
 "the campaign, captured in the hashtag #releasethememo, which was trending on Twitter for days, may have a far more significant impact than the memo’s contents. It was a choreographed effort by House Republicans and top White House officials to push a highly contentious theme..." 
 Now, read this, from @DissentMag on the "new conspiracists", by @RussellMuirhead and Nancy Rosenblum. "The conspiracist mindset moved into the White House with the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States." https://t.co/XjjMF1eNvJ 
 "Conspiracism is not new of course, but the conspiracism we see today does introduce something new—conspiracy without the theory. And it betrays a new destructive impulse: to delegitimate the government. Often the aim is merely to deligitimate an individual or a specific office." 
 Back to the end of @MarkMazzettiNYT's piece: "But, he said, there could be significantly more harm if people begin looking for political motives in every action the F.B.I. takes. ''People across the country are going to say, ‘Can I trust the F.B.I.?' he said." 
 Donald Trump is more than happy- he is hungry- to advance conspiracy theories. He would not hesitate to torch any person or institution that stands in his way, and to use conspiracy theories, whispers and suspicions to do so, to a degree no President has ever done. 
 The facts of the memo actually HURT the President's position. But once again, we fail to accept the reality of our situation: it's not about the facts. 
 And it works. Stunning, sad poll for @Axios by @surveymonkey: Donald Trump had turned the GOP against the FBI: https://t.co/ZjwGS4AZdL 
 The circle is complete. https://t.co/6Q32ZZLoHq 
 And the headlines help- Donald's conspiracies exploit flaws in journalism and the presentation of information that exacerbate the problem: https://t.co/hamCYd7EFg
