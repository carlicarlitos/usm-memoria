COMEY MEMOS: (THREAD) Working my way through the 15 pages of #ComeyMemos. Here are the most important and/or shocking revelations: 1/ 
 During #Comey's 1/6/17 at Trump Tower, @Comey told Trump that the Russians allegedly had tapes involving Trump &amp; prostitutes at a Moscow hotel in 2013. Could these be the infamous #PeeTapes? #ComeyMemos 2/ 
 Trump also praised #Comey on 1/6/17 for his handling of the #ClintonEmails investigation. @realDonaldTrump lavished praise on @Comey, indicating that Comey had conducted himself "honorably" and had a great reputation. #ComeyMemos 3/ 
 When Comey mentioned that #Russia had tapes showing Trump &amp; prostitutes, Trump interjected "there were no prostitutes," and them claimed to be the kind of guy who didn't need to "go there." #WRONG! #ComeyMemos 4/ https://t.co/vp6zgQLwI4 
 Without prompting, Trump launched into a tirade against some of those accusing him of sexual assault, specifically referencing a particular stripper. Comey told him the FBI wasn't investigating him. #ComeyMemos 5/ https://t.co/oP3rFEbsNK 
 On 1/28/17, Trump held a private meeting with #Comey in the WH. Trump never asked Comey an open-ended question or let him choose the topic of conversation. Shouldn't a new POTUS seek guidance from a seasoned FBI Director on nat sec affairs?? #ComeyMemos 6/ 
 Instead, Trump spent his hour w/ the FBI Director talking about his Inauguration crowd size, White House vs Mar-a-lago accommodations, the 2016 campaign, his son's height, and (again) defended himself against allegations of sexual assault. #ComeyMemos 7/ 
 After #Comey emphasized that he was "not on anybody's side politically and could not be counted on in that traditional political sense," Trump stated that he "needed loyalty and expected loyalty." Comey did not reply "or even nod." #ComeyMemos 8/ 
 During that first WH meeting, Trump continued to obsess over #HillarysEmails, going over the sequence of associated events in great detail. After Comey indicated that "the investigators ALL agreed that there was no case," Trump said he disagreed. #ComeyMemos 9/ 
 Trump once again brought up the #GoldenShowers "thing" and emphasized that it was fake news. Trump obsessed over whether @FLOTUS thought it was true, &amp; then (falsely) claimed that he did not stay overnight for the Miss Universe trip. #ComeyMemos 10/ 
 Trump directly asked Comey to have the @FBI "investigate the whole thing [#PeePeeTape &amp; prostitutes] to prove it was a lie." (Given Trump's obsession w/ everything gold, it wouldn't be surprising that Trump has a fetish for #GoldenShowers. #AmIRite?) #ComeyMemos 11/ 
 1/28/17 #ComeyMemos: "[Trump] then returned to loyalty, saying "I need loyalty." I replied that he would always get honesty from me. He paused and said that's what he wants, "honest loyalty." I replied "you will get that from me."" 12/ 
 Comey clarified in his memo that they may have understood the phrase "honest loyalty" differently. Comey meant loyalty to the office, the country, and the truth. "I decided it would not be productive to push the subject further." #ComeyMemos 13/ 
 During the 1/28/17 meeting, Trump told Comey that he had serious reservations about #MichaelFlynn's judgement. However, Trump continued to keep Flynn on as his National Security Advisor until the media forced his hand. #ComeyMemos 14/ 
 During an undated meeting with Trump COS Reince Priebus, Priebus improperly inquired about FBI's investigation into #MichaelFlynn. Comey told COS that these inquiries should go through DOJ to avoid accusations of improper WH influence over ongoing investigations. #ComeyMemos 15/ 
 In @Comey's memos, he obfuscates any personal responsibility in playing politics w/ the FBI &amp; influencing the election, telling Priebus that "it also wasn't my fault that #HumaAbedin forwarded emails to #AnthonyWeiner." #ComeyMemos 16/ 
 Back to the #PeePeeTape: Remarkably, @realDonaldTrump brought up the #GoldenShowers in a 3rd meeting w/ @Comey, this time in the Oval Office. Trump again obsessed that @FLOTUS might believe the allegation. #ComeyMemos 17/ 
 Once again denying #GoldenShowersGate, Trump nonsensically added that #Putin had told him that Russia has "some of the most beautiful hookers in the world." #ComeyMemos Hey @Franklin_Graham &amp; other #FakeChristians, why was your @POTUS talking about prostitutes w/ Putin? 18/ 
 Trump asked whether #Comey agreed w/ his reply during a TV interview that he "respected" Putin. Comey criticized Trump for comparing the US to Russia "b/c we aren't the kind of killers that Putin is." Trump didn't take too well to the criticism. #ComeyMemos 19/ https://t.co/AkYA7eUyFO 
 After dismissing AG, COS &amp; others from the Oval, Trump once again met privately w/ Comey, this time to talk abt #Flynn. Trump emphasized Flynn didn't do anything wrong vis a vis Russia, but had lied to @VP. #ComeyMemos 20/ 
 When lamenting to #Comey about leaks of his phone calls w/ foreign leaders, Trump observed how the leaked transcripts included things he didn't remember saying. He then said "they say I have one of the world's greatest memories." #ComeyMemos 21/ 
 During his rant about leakers, Trump instructed #Comey to talk to AG Sessions about pursuing prosecution of reporters. (Trump is a clear and present danger to our #1A rights.) #ComeyMemos 22/ 
 In a bold-faced attempt to obstruct justice, Trump, referring to the #Flynn investigation, told #Comey "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." #ComeyMemos 23/ 
 3/30/17 phone call: Trump said "the cloud of this Russia business" was making it difficult to run the country. He claimed to have letter from large DC law firm confirming he'd received no income from Russia. (Why not just release #TrumpTaxReturns to prove it?) #ComeyMemos 24/ 
 For a 4th time, Trump brought up the prostitutes subject w/ #Comey, denying meeting w/ any in Russia. "Can you imagine me, hookers?" (Uhm, #YESWECAN!) "I have a beautiful wife and it has been very painful. #ComeyMemos 25/ 
 On 3/30/17, Trump once again clearly attempted to obstruct justice. He explicitly asked what #Comey could do to "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation. He encouraged @Comey to publicize the fact that Trump was not under investigation. #ComeyMemos 26/ 
 Finally, on 4/11/17, Trump complained that the #RussiaInvestigation was making things difficult for him &amp; emphasized he needed Comey's help "b/c I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know." This is more evidence of #ObstructionOfJustice #ComeyMemos 27/
