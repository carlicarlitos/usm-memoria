1. New #QAnon drop tonight tells us that: "The gun found by the #USSS" (Secret Service)) "was an intercept" they provided, that the "Protect code went live," and that they "are moving up the timetable" on their plans. #Q https://t.co/lbQFBzdpTM https://t.co/fEvYnimjJk 
 2. #QAnon tells us tonight to" "Stay tuned. Everything has meaning or a purpose. @Jack - getting nervous? &lt;-------------------------Twitter CEO* Phase [2]. #Q" Many on Twitter tonight have had large numbers of their followers go away. I lost about 50 net out of 25,035 (0.2%). https://t.co/cX2DlFhYRB 
 3. So one #Anon connects #QAnon's "Deep Dream" reference to the Bourne film (https://t.co/ansGUpRcIb) in which the CEO of a social media giant known as #DeepDream secretly funded by #DeepState in the startup stage has has 2nd thoughts about giving #CIA access. https://t.co/X5Ae14Ul7h 
 4. The same #Anon also connects "Iron Hand"to #Qanon's references to "Iron Eagle"? "Iron Hand" is CIA's targeted assassination program in Bourne film. I saw that "Iron Eagle" is a movie where "full access to.. intel"'s used to save where US gov wouldn't. https://t.co/I5l5s7Vs1G https://t.co/X0LuSGUCB1 
 5. In resp to above #Anon (3., 4.) #QAnon responds: "Big post. @Jack thought he was protected. No sleep since drop. Tasked [3] to remove followers in drip order and restrict. Coincidence? HOT in DC. No sleep. Stay tuned. #Q" So, this's why we lost our followers here tonight. 
 6. Note #QAnon tonight writes: "@Jack thought he was protected. No sleep since drop." #Q Does Q "knows when you are sleeping, knows when your awake, knows if @Jack been bad or good so be..."? https://t.co/31C6wwMorn 
 7. On Sunday night 2/18, just before 9PM, #QAnon had told us ":Protect 6/14-46 :Protect 6/14-46" #Q (6/14-46 is President Trump's birthday.) https://t.co/PFGBquTgi0 
 8. "Tonight #QAnon tells us that "The gun found by the USSS was an intercept we provided. This is not a game. Protect code went live." #Q 
 9. #QAnon also tells us that "Everything has meaning or a purpose." #Q 
 10. So tonight, an #Anon responds to #QAnon's indication that "The gun found by the USSS was an intercept we provided," by posting #Q's Sunday 9PM post 9748) telling us twice to protect "6/14-46". So, then in lieu of Monday morning's gun discovery, Q asks, "Coincidence? Q" https://t.co/G3mCY4X3SY 
 11. So, it appears credible to believe that #Q may have potentially saved President Trump's life Monday morning this week, by imploring Sunday night to protect the President. "Coincidence? Q" #QAnon "There are no coincidences" Q https://t.co/jMJvRuzB0t 
 12. Lastly, we note, early this mornig, that #QAnon posts: "AG Sessions. US Cyber Task Force. Important. #Q"
