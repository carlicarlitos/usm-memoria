(Thread) I’ve made some disjointed comments and tweets on how the @DevinNunes memo is bullshit, let me put it all in one thread for easier consumption. The #FISAMemo is 100% bullshit. 
 First off I see the #ReleaseTheMemo and #QAnon crowd pushing this narrative that the dossier invalidates the entire investigation, it doesn’t. The investigation was actually triggered by Papadapolous drunkenly running his mouth to an Australian diplomat: https://t.co/M3Kmz5qb2t 
 The memo itself even asserts this on Page 4. .@realDonaldTrump and the rest of his supporters appear to have ignored this part of the memo because it doesn’t support their narrative. https://t.co/mlWily8eXz 
 Not only that but the @AIVD provided the US with intel regarding the Russian interference: https://t.co/njI2ZfHe47 
 Another thing I see pushed is that the dossier was the sole reason for the Page FISA warrant, there are two things the memo and the @GOP and the rest of the #MAGA crowd doesn’t say or maybe even doesn’t know is that Page was under a FISA warrant before: https://t.co/Ccl0NqoZjz 
 And that in 2013 he actually openly bragged in a letter that he had close ties with the Kremlin: https://t.co/glYfAZYAsK 
 Another thing the memo claims is that Andrew McCabe testified that without the Steele dossier they never would have gotten the FISA warrant. Not only is that only the memo that claims that(closed session no official transcript has been released) but it has been disputed by 
 two separate people: https://t.co/YVnWZYODaq 
 This memo is a half baked and half assed attempt to undermine the #RussiaInvestigation and Mueller. What is actually does is show the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump attacks are desperate and fearful, it is the flailing of cornered people knowing justice is coming for them. 
 (Update 1/2) Oh and here is another Carter Page video further showing there is more than the dossier: https://t.co/igadaeJ38b 
 (Update 2/2) Here is the second Carter Page video: https://t.co/tKXqr1friF 960314013577043968 
 (Update) Adding this thread by @ericgarland excellent in depth analysis of the dossier here: https://t.co/b0eBm1eqfA 
 Here is the footnote update, Republicans now concede there was a memo saying the research was political: https://t.co/1gPjqy47xR
