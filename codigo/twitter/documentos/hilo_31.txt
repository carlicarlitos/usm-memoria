A new meta-analysis examining the link between #Facebook and #wellbeing! Let me explain why it cannot tell us much about anything (1/n) https://t.co/Jk7deTtgST 
 1) It does not actually look at the link between Facebook use and well-being, it looks at 'problematic Facebook use' and well-being (2/n) 
 2) Spot the bias - are these search terms going to show you the whole scope of research? (3/n) https://t.co/jS0FpRBNMJ 
 3) Also, this is a big problem. Low quality research = low quality met-analysis. Bad ingredients = bad soup. (4/n) https://t.co/MZfsgW3b7A 
 4) The authors missed many recent high-quality studies that showed a lack in negative link (e.g. @ShuhBillSkee Goldilocks paper) (5/n) 
 @ShuhBillSkee 5) The authors don't include @tdienlin @MasurPhil **longitudinal** study showing that social media use increases life satisfaction. (6/n) https://t.co/hRLLhDEo8A 
 @ShuhBillSkee @tdienlin @MasurPhil This field does not need meta-analyses - first and foremost it needs high quality research. (7/7)
