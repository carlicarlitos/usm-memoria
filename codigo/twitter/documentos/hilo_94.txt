🛑BREAKING🛑 THREAD: Michael COHEN is in the treasonweasel barrell‼️ Mueller is probing Cohen’s dealings for Trump Tower🇷🇺Moscow and the Ukraine “peace deal” that he &amp; Felix SATER “negotiated.”😎 1/ #MuellerTime https://t.co/5vTBzANP1G 
 Mueller Ihas requested documents &amp; interviewed witnesses about “incidents” involving Cohen.🤔 Cohen basically knows EVERYTHING on Trump’s “business,” campaign and political activities.🤨 If Mueller is investigating Cohen, he’s investigating TRUMP‼️😎 2/ #MuellerTime 
 Cohen played a role in *at least two* “episodes” involving Russian-related issues that Mueller is probing‼️ Of course, one is Cohen’s dealings *during the campaign* to help Trump Org build Trump Tower Moscow🇷🇺. 3/ 
 Cohen brought Trump a letter of intent (LOI) in Oct’15 from a #Russian developer to build a Trump Tower Moscow🇷🇺. 4/ https://t.co/YHo65irkJs 
 After the project stalled, Cohen emailed Putin’s chief spokesman PESKOV to ask for help. The #SteeleDossier said Peskov handled the “CLINTON dossier” personally for PUTIN‼️ No wonder #Mueller is probing Cohen’s dealings.😎 5/ 
 Another area that Mueller’s team “has explored” (meaning: they *already* did)👉🏼the #Russia🇷🇺friendly “peace proposal” for Ukraine, delivered to Cohen by an Ukrainian lawmaker one week after Trump took office.🤨 6/ 
 Cohen is one the 9 members of Team🇷🇺Trump included in Mueller's #subpoena for Sam #Nunberg's communications. Cohen is the ONLY ONE in Nunberg's subpoena who never worked for the campaign or in the WH — and the ONLY ONE still working for Trump.🔥 7/ https://t.co/L9pUSHtKJN 
 Sorry...need to shift around some things due to this incoming nor'easter. Be back shortly.😎 8/ 
 Importantly, Cohen worked closely with Felix SATER – a longtime FBI informant – on *both* the Trump Tower Moscow and the Ukrainian "peace deal."🤔 Back in August, Sater told people that he and TRUMP were going to PRISON‼️ 9/ #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia https://t.co/n6LqN0OIzu 
 Sater organized a Jan'17 meeting in NY w/Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko who gave Cohen a "back-channel" proposal👉🏼deal to lift US #sanctions on Russia🇷🇺. 10/ #SHOCKER 
 🔥The *timing* of the Ukrainian deal is significant, b/c it came just weeks after Misha🇷🇺Flynn was nailed in SIGINT telling Russian ambassador Kiskyak that the Trump administration would ROLL BACK #sanctions.🙄 And Flynn is SQUEALING‼️😎 11/ #Busted #Corruption 
 Cohen, Sater and Artemenko all have DIFFERENT stories.🙄 1⃣Cohen said he left the plan in Flynn’s WH office 2⃣Artmenko said Sater told him that Cohen got the plan to Flynn 3⃣Sater said Cohen intended to give Flynn the plan but Flynn "resigned" Now, Flynn is SQUEALING‼️ 12/ 
 Cohen told the NYTimes that he left the Ukraine plan in Flynn's WH office, but later told the WaPo that the Times story was “fake news." Next, Cohen said he threw away the unopened envelope w/the plan in a trash can: “I never looked at it. I never turned it over to anyone.”🙄13/ 
 Bizarrely, Cohen admitted to The Post that Artemenko said during their meeting that he had CONSULTED w/the #Russian🇷🇺government for the deal: “He said Russia was on board — the Russian government." 14/ 
 No surprise, Mueller is investigating EVERY deal that Trump was making with foreign interests, especially those involving the LIFTING of #sanctions. No wonder that Trump and the rest of Team🇷🇺Traitor are SO nervous. It's #MuellerTime‼️😎 /end
