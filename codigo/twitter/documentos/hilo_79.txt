I'm a "Hollywood Liberal" Ted. I like to put my hard earned $$ behind candidates who unlike you, do not take 11 MILLION $$ into your Super PAC from the Mercers or use Cambridge Analytica's stolen data to influence the outcome of your campaign #BetoForTexas @Rosie @chelseahandler https://t.co/8h7tHqwq6u 
 When the Mercers were backing #NeverTrump candidate @tedcruz-- "the Cruz camp dropped $5.8 million with the Cambridge Analytica -- spending $3 million with the company as early as February. " 5.8 Million for Stolen Data... #BetoForTexas https://t.co/F2wsIKlHC4 
 3. As a "Hollywood Liberal" @tedcruz I prefer to give my $$ and support to candidates who do not foment hate and virulent Islamophobia like you and associate with hate groups like Pamela Geller's who is banned from entering the UK. #BetoForTexas https://t.co/tqtVv6zKBv 
 4. As a "Hollywood Liberal" @tedcruz I prefer to support candidates like @BetoORourke who unlike you don't have Senior Advisors like Nick Muzin who was hired by Russian-Linked Shell Company to Boost Albaniaâ€™s Right-Wing Party in DC https://t.co/EekkIE2zYB 
 5. As a "Hollywood Liberal" Ted, I like candidates like @BetoORourke who doesn't party with and invite Russian linked Albanian politicians accused of corruption like Lulzim Basha and Fatmir Mediu to the inauguration in Jan. https://t.co/hsIxnGWOS7 
 6. As a "Hollywood Liberal" Ted I prefer candidates like #BetoORourke who don't make "hating Muslims mainstream" like you do. You are part of a global Islamophobia racket along with virulent xenophobes, Frank Gaffney and John Bolton who you've endorsed to replace Flynn https://t.co/MAXIr3eDJ4 
 We now know from @washingtonpost Mercers &amp; Bannon were in discussion with #SCL/#CambridgeAnalytica/#AlexanderNix in 2014, so this Apr. 2015 article "Securing the backing of the Mercers is huge for Ted Cruz" puts his #NeverTrump candidacy in a new light. https://t.co/V5jhQNpbEV
