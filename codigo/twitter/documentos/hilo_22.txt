Her: Because every time I said no he tightened his hold around me Him: She wasn’t that attractive Kobe Bryant is a rapist. Kobe Bryant just won an #Oscar #TimesUp #MeToo https://t.co/yV5JFIYgpR 
 After initially lying to police #KobeBryant admits the sex only lasted for 5 mins, he grabbed her by the throat then asked to jerk off in her face because that’s his “finishing move” she was 19. #MeToo #Oscars https://t.co/IcbIb9zaUn 
 Too many lacerations to count. NOT consistent with consensual sex. You’re full of s**t @TheAcademy #KobeBryant #Oscars #MeToo #TimesUp https://t.co/CS23cfLA7N 
 #KobeBryant said the bruise around her neck was just what happens and suggested asking Michelle (not his wife) “you’re not gonna tell anybody right” is what he said while raping her. #Oscars #Oscars90 #Oscars2018 https://t.co/KBkXwOjCzG 
 Evidence included a T-shirt stained with the 19 year olds blood. Oh and #KobeBryant made her stay and clean up before she could leave. #Oscars #Oscars90 #TimesUp https://t.co/fwmJO46eax 
 #KobeBryant’s accuser immediately told a bellhop she was raped, she was crying and her clothing was torn. #Oscars #Oscars90 #MeToo https://t.co/bXMzLgslA5 
 What happened? #KobeBryant’s lawyers dragged the victim through the mud. They used her sexual history to shame her, they used her mental health to shame her #shame #Oscars https://t.co/arPTYpAlpr 
 #KobeBryant’s lawyers used the victims name over and over in court they fought to have it released. They #slutshamed her @AshleyJudd she was 19 but @TheAcademy just gave him an Oscar #Oscars90 #MeToo #Oscars2018 https://t.co/S77XLvzxO4 
 He paid her off. Thought payoffs always meant guilty? #KobeBryant #Oscars https://t.co/PsMYUiGau7 
 BTW #KobeBryant is also homophobic he was fined $100k for calling a referee a fa***t but guess that’s okay with @TheAcademy #Oscars #TimesUp #Hypocrites https://t.co/mEMv32eW0F
