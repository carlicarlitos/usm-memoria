1/ Thread: #QAnon suggests a major video related to Hillary Clinton and the DNC is about to drop. https://t.co/0wBrV3tfLU 
 2/ Is the stage set for a drop of HRC +++ + +++++ (Raw vid 5:5). This is written as a ?, but there is no question mark. +++ and + refer to sides of the pyramid, but what about +++++ ? Is there a power higher than the pyramid? Raw vid 5:5 means "Raw video, loud and clear". 
 3/ EX-rvid5774 EX could mean Extract, Excerpt, Example. The prefix EX means "out of, formerly, utterly, thoroughly, indicating a former title or status". So it could mean "Ex(cerpt) raw video, ID 5744". Let's go hunting for 5774. #QAnon 
 4./ The digits 5774 were part of a hash tweeted out by JA last year: https://t.co/5tV6twPgfX The context of that tweet: https://t.co/gJSPdj0MMA 
 5/ This was right around the time of this story about NYPD folks who may or may not have copied the contents of Wiener's laptop. (Think mirror). https://t.co/iLDqqbYfvy 
 6/ It could also refer to wikileaks email ID # 5774 https://t.co/zMmxwFDJsP 
 7/ rvid is also a file extention for software that captures happenings on a computer screen. https://t.co/WOkAOmDJoM So, someone could have been running rvid during a live broadcast over skype or something. 
 8/ We are 8 tweets in, and already anons are suggesting +++ + +++++ = 315, or March 15th, the Ides of March. So far it looks as if... on or before the ideas of march, there may be compromising material released that was recorded using screen capture software. 
 9/ ... and that video might have something to with the hash JA tweeted out when he said HRC was cold and creepy, in the context of discussing how HRC wanted to run against @realDonaldTrump because she thought she would win against him. 
 10/ rvid5774 is also an ID for a Foreign EXchange transaction. https://t.co/xjBNdxTfL8 Scroll through the IDs to find transaction # rvid5774 (page 1100) 
 11/ "We have it all" (Self explanatory) "Re_read re: stage." Go to... https://t.co/e7X6at8gkE ...and CTRL+F to find all instances of "stage" and re_read those posts. 
 12/ The post that stands out is #570 at https://t.co/e7X6at8gkE [The 16 Year Plan to Destroy America] Stage SC [AS [187]] The Death (murder) of Scalia was supposed to set the stage for a massive operation involving untold horrors and enslavement. 
 13/ I would assign a high likelihood that the video in question refers to what comes later... " "Keep them starved" "Keep them blind" "Keep them stupid" HRC March 13, 2013 [intercept]. " 
 14/ Recent data suggests the contents of the video might serve to isolate the DNC from a huge component of its voter base: minorities. Without that support, DNC crumbles. Let's look at some data points to see if HRC might be racist. There's this https://t.co/ai038r4dWC 
 15/ And this..... https://t.co/zLIeLDwYPj 
 16/ And this... https://t.co/iZ2imQmpwe 
 17/ But would that really be the "nail in the coffin" of the DNC? I doubt it. What's going to be the nail in the coffin is hard, undeniable proof that Seth Rich was murdered, and this was agreed to and sanctioned by the highest levels of the party. 
 18/ Kim DotCom has said in the past this wasn't a hack, but an inside job by someone with a usb stick. (RAIN MAKER, perhaps?) https://t.co/43ua44mNtR 
 19/ Anons have suggested that "Is the stage set for a drop of HRC +++ + +++++" Where +++ + +++++ = and a child Anything is possible. However, this would make it much more difficult to legally share the video. 
 20/ It would definitely trigger a lot of normies. Cognitive dissonance would creep in and people would find alternate theories, aka the D33PF@KES conspiracy to explain it away. https://t.co/6YjZtOnDsn 
 21/ When the video does come out, they will say it's a #deepfake. https://t.co/bCMPeyOHnq 
 22/ The Failing NY Times puts out it's pre-emptive deepfake story to do damage control. #QAnon says "No free passes". https://t.co/pr8FhaTuqJ 
 23/ using the 111 shift, and assuming March 15th, 2018, what did #QAnon post 111 days prior? https://t.co/e7X6at8gkE It sort of lines up with what's being discussed here. "When this breaks, many won't swallow" https://t.co/aOvbr01Mwh 
 24/ And just in case the deepfake narrative backfires, the good folks at newsweek have deployed a backup narrative. Guess what it is? MUH RUSSIANS https://t.co/EJrJiPHgO2 #HRCVideo #ReleaseTheVideo 
 25/ Remember the limited hangout, or easily debunked hoax about slick willy in a hotel room with a hooker? 
 26/ It was a psychological operation to condition the viewer to disregard any future leaks as a probable hoax. https://t.co/HiqFtgVTvk 
 27/ Who remembers the Anons buzzing about a possible fake HRC emerging from Chelsea's apartment shortly after being chucked into her scooby van like a side of beef? https://t.co/SNvA0fSkxf 
 28/ If the MSM is controlled, would they even broadcast such a video? Probably not. So the MSM would be bypassed. Anons suggest that "Trust the PLAN" refers to this: https://t.co/Ngg3dIpUWf 
 29/ If the PLAN Emergency Alert System were used to broadcast such data, what type of emergency would have to occur? Why does Q say to archive everything offline? https://t.co/AykWEYzPIO 
 30/ WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM - MY FELLOW AMERICANS.... THE STORM IS UPON US https://t.co/Qg8nGEpbA7
