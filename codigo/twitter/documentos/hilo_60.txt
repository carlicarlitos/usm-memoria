Jeff Sessions had no choice in the matter of firing McCabe, because of the Inspector General's report. I would caution everybody into reading too much into this. Russia wants @JeffSessions gone. 
 If Andy McCabe opened a criminal investigation into Jeff Sessions but Mueller told Sessions lawyer that it had been closed, it was closed ***for a reason*** folks. And the reason wasn't "McCabe got it wrong, Sessions was transparent with Congress" 
 Everybody stop and think for a moment. Compartmentalization is real. @Comey compartmentalized like a champ. I don't think McCabe was read in on Sessions. Hence McCabe's opening of a probe, and its being closed again by Bobby III Sticks. SAIC Charlie Kable didn't open a probe :) 
 You haven't seen @Comey complain about the firing of Andy McCabe because he knows perfectly well that the IG report tied Sessions' hands. Anybody looking to drag down Sessions is doing Putin's work for him. Complain to and about Horowitz, if you want to; not Sessions. #McCabe 
 PS: just to confuse you guys even more, I have zero time for Jeff Sessions, but the man was pictured dining with Rosenstein for a reason, gang. Steady as she goes, chaps. Hold your fire. We're getting to the end of this terrible period of US history now. Stay frosty. ;) https://t.co/nPehD1UiFb
