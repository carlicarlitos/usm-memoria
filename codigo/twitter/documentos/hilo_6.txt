REALITY CHECK: Pruitt has spent $3 MILLION on security and travel in just over a year. His security detail is three times as large as his predecessors, yet the AP found no court records of cases of anyone being arrested for threatening Pruitt. #BootPruitt https://t.co/HfbjejphZ6 
 REALITY CHECK: Here's where you could stay in DC for the rent Pruitt was paying his fossil fuel lobbyist landlord (though his rent was late, so the landlord changed the locks). Spoiler alert; These aren't super fancy like Pruitt's luxury condo #BootPruitt https://t.co/faCKPh0iti 
 REALITY CHECK: While Pruitt is a dangerous threat to the health of our families, his sloppy and careless legal work is undermining his ability to even implement his extreme pro-polluter agenda in several key cases. #BootPruitt https://t.co/lZKNC2kUjf 
 REALITY CHECK: Trump is defending a guy who regularly defies him....#BootPruitt https://t.co/FfsB2TKhOZ 
 ....over and over again. #BootPruitt https://t.co/JGA39bmuuj 
 REALITY CHECK: Trump is also defending the guy who called him an "empty vessel." https://t.co/ovfQIUUssn #BootPruitt 
 REALITY CHECK: To top it all off, Pruitt's spending and behavior is because, according to many, he wants “to be treated like he was the president.” #BootPruitt https://t.co/OJxkNFsYDT 
 Pruitt is a danger to the public, yet is losing in the courts while conning @realDonaldTrump into saving his job...all while defying &amp; insulting his boss. Perhaps Trump is the empty vessel Scott Pruitt said he is. That would explain how Pruitt so easily conned him. #BootPruitt
