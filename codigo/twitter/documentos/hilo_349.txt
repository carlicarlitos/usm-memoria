Adam Schiff Asking Carter Page Whether He's Invoking The Fifth Amendment Is Something Else. https://t.co/aNchV7MnTG 
 Carter Page appears to thinks the "double jeopardy" bar means suffering from "extrajudicial punishment" bars a legal trial. Or something. 
 Page on July 2016 Dvorkovich conversation: "No private meetings" "I greeted him briefly" "a private conversation" "5 seconds to 10 seconds" https://t.co/Jm8qhQvZ3e 
 You can basically hear Schiff's voice from the transcript; he can't believe what he's hearing. https://t.co/swmQAyWupJ 
 Carter Page On Why He Withheld From The Committee The Memo He Sent To The Trump Campaign About His July 2016 Russia Trip: https://t.co/pjYtoZkYIh 
 Carter Page has been interviewed by the FBI "four or five" times this year, he says. https://t.co/PnIzuD86HO 
 UM. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? https://t.co/cvD2UBYKdc 
 [Page says something.] Gowdy: "I hope not." Page: OK. [Gowdy says something.] Page: "I know there's kind of overlap." Gowdy: "I hope not." 
 Even Gowdy can't get over Page. https://t.co/cwP5dVNfQG

 Page believes allegations made against him are more likely to have influenced the election than efforts at interference by the Russian govt. https://t.co/oB0vUl7YiF 
 Seriously, read this. This is Trey Gowdy questioning Carter Page. 
 Shlomo Weber invited Page to come to Russia in 2016 after Page became affiliated with the Trump campaign. https://t.co/RkkRkZsPSg 
 This is what transpires, Marx Brothers-like, when Schiff asks if anyone Page met in Moscow in July 2016 maintained communications w him. https://t.co/ELcpV8Oj58 
 This is Page on a second meeting with the high-ranking Russian gov't official he first met in July 2016. https://t.co/CjzkhRUSMm 
 Oh. My. God. https://t.co/IXrmwUV9OO 
 In addition to the March 2016 meeting in which Papadopoulos talked about Russia, that group, minus Trump, got together again in June 2016. https://t.co/dXOUF6uIfe 
 Sessions was at this June dinner meeting. And Carter Page testified under oath that he directly told Sessions that he was going to Russia. 
 So, that's another Russia contact that Jeff Sessions knew about. 
 It's like, each conversation is more painful than the last, even when it's relatively mundane like this. https://t.co/5EId6TmA9j 
 "And I'm a Delta Sky Miles member, so I got, you know, upgraded to economy comfort on one way." - Carter Page 
 Oof. https://t.co/914kQagwHW 
 Hmm. What did Schiff do here? https://t.co/n69u4y8kTt 
 Lol. https://t.co/HC107EXfBS 
 "I would include outreach as being â€” again, it was a general warm greeting." https://t.co/6ZYrug3HFi 
 *blink* I think I just passed out sitting upright on my couch, so, I'm gonna have to end it here for tonight. Thanks for following along!
