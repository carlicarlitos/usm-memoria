(1) In his take @SinaToossi claims the “Clinton and Obama administrations” thought about the Iranian people, conveniently forgetting how Clinton did nothing in the face of #Iran’s 1999 students uprising crackdown &amp; Obama turned his back on Iranians in 2009 https://t.co/TT27PBdi5p https://t.co/IXl13Y2xvz 
 (2) @SinaToossi blows his cover by mentioning “regime change,” making clear his mission, being a Tehran apologist, of devoting his “journalism” to preserving a regime with a grotesque human rights dossier in power. Over 3,000 executions under #Iran's “moderate” Hassan Rouhani. 
 (3) @SinaToossi voices his main concern, being the #IranProtests, by attempting to downsize the 2017/2018 uprising to “parts of Iran.” Reminder: Over 142 cities were scenes of unprecedented revolt, prompting the regime to kill more than 50 protesters &amp; arrest over 8,000. 
 (4) By criticizing Trump’s support for the Iranian people’s nationwide demonstrations, @SinaToossi makes it clear he prefers the #Obama-type appeasement policy of turning his back on Iranians &amp; the Syrian people in 2013. Shame. Shame. Shame. 
 (5) #Iran is exactly a face-off between a “totalitarian regime” against the “oppressed people.” The likes of @SinaToossi have made it their life-long mission to muddy the waters in order to quell foreign-based backing of the Iranians' ongoing protests against the mullahs’ regime. 
 (6) @SinaToossi deliberately downsizes the anti-government nature of the #RegimeChange protests. And he uses the word “militant” to cause fear in the uninformed reader’s mind, while failing to admit the militant nature of the regime’s crackdown machine. 
 (7) @SinaToossi says “Many looked worryingly at the vandalism and violence” regarding the 2017/2018 protests, yet deliberately cloaks the regime’s blatant &amp; vicious crackdown against any anti-government protests. 
 (8) @SinaToossi claims to be in touch with the people in saying “An overarching fear was that that Iran could become another Syria.” Q: Why don’t you mention the very fact that #Iran’s regime is the main party to blame for marking #Syria the hell on earth it is today? Hypocrit. 
 (9) “Despite restrictions, protests do happen, and Iran has an active political life &amp; civil society. Political debate is also lively &amp; open within the multiple ideological views accepted by the state.” Anyone familiar with #Iran &amp; its regime knows this claim is a complete lie. 
 (10) “Parliamentary and presidential elections are consequently competitive and affect state policies.” Of course, @SinaToossi refuses to mention how anyone seeking to take part in #Iran’s elections must be vetted by the Guardian Council, an ultraconservative body of 12 mullahs. 
 (11) @SinaToossi goes the distance to portray an innocent image of Rouhani striving to bring about change in #Iran, only to face resistance form Khamenei &amp; his faction. This is a devious regime-backed scheme in Western #MSM. https://t.co/cUpRwiRw52 
 (12) Branding the Iranian opposition PMOI/MEK as “cultish” also blows @SinaToossi’s cover, as this is the terminology used by #Iran’s regime &amp; its apologists. Here’s a read explaining how Tehran fears the PMOI/MEK: https://t.co/uWjJ3mneCT 
 (13) And when @SinaToossi quotes “Iran-based analyst Fareed Marjaee,” rest assured both are #Iran apologists &amp; any “analyst” based inside Iran cannot say a word to the media without looking over their shoulder or having the regime’s blessing. 
 (14) And by twice again mentioning the PMOI/MEK &amp; their close relations with Trump’s National Security Advisor John Bolton &amp; Trump advisor and close ally, former New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani, @SinaToossi again blows his cover, as #Iran’s regime fears the PMOI/MEK the most. 
 (15) And some advice to @SinaToossi: Don’t ever raise the preposterous “rally around the flag” claim again. You know better yourself how pathetic that is. Former Tehran mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf revealed how the regime only has 4% of the population’s support. 
 (16) And when a "writer" like @SinaToossi enjoys support from the likes of @BarbaraSlavin1, a die-hard #Iran regime apologist, there’s not much left to say… Here’s Barbara’s very “professional” reaction to an anti-regime rally in Washington, DC. https://t.co/FufN4JLRaq
