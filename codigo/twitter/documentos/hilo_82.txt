1) Attribution to an #Anon. Not wholly my work. Poke holes where required. “It's not a Budget it's an #Omnibus" It’s not an official ‘Federal Budget.’ It’s an Omnibus bill. Did @POTUS outsmart them yet again? #QanonPosts #Qanon #TheStormIsHere #DrainTheSwamp #Q 
 2) Congress basically screwed themselves by not passing a formal budget. Per the Constitution, the #President must adhere to a budget set forth by #Congress and direct the expenditures as provided therein. #PaulRyan #SenateChairman #Pelosi #Schumer #DrainTheDeepState 
 3) This is another one of those big Porkulus bills like they gave #Obama for his horrid 8 years. An #omnibusbill may have some ‘instructions’ as to how the money will be spent, but #Obama ignored them. #Governance #Government #governmentshutdown 
 4) He spent the money or didn’t spend it however he saw fit. #Congress didn’t do a thing about it because they couldn’t (or didn't want to: remember the swamp is on both sides). I think our President observed how this happened, year after year. 
 5) @POTUS must have realized that those ‘appropriations’ in these Omnibus bills are mere ‘suggestions’ and so like #Obama, @realDonaldTrump can allocate this money, within reason, on whatever he wants to. Or not spend it. #PlannedParenthood? #thewall? #SanctuaryCities? 
 6) What if @POTUS decided to tell the #Treasury Dept to ‘slow-walk’ that money to Planned Parenthood until, for example, #Senate stops delaying and confirms appointees? What if @realDonaldTrump ‘slow-walks’ money until #SanctuaryCities assist ICE with criminal illegal aliens? 
 7) Congress appropriates, up to @POTUS to spend it, or not, as he pleases. I suspect this is why Obama never had a Budget in his Presidency. #Congress did continual #Omnibus's and he did as he pleased. Some might say this was intentional. #Qanon #TheStormIsHere #BuildTheWall
