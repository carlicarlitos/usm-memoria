Did you know that our country is very close to a Constitutional Convention? Quietly our republican controlled state governments are one by one voting to call a Constitutional Convention. https://t.co/XWvp0FvPft 
 Back when the country was founded we did try to have a government that was a confederation of states, it failed miserably. The Articles of Confederation were ammended in 1787 and our union was completed. https://t.co/93xcSHjJl3 
 In 1861 the Southern states tried to succeed because they feared the abolitionists of the North would end slavery &amp; they would lose their power in the consolidation of a federal government The direct result was a bloody war that pitted Americans against Americans &amp; lasted 5 years 
 The Republicans are attempting to turn the clock back before 1787 and reinstate supreme states rights. This would create chaos, rivalry, inequity of our citizens as a whole and make many states unstable. https://t.co/Oc2lztpMyT 
 If they succeed, the Republican controlled state legislatures would have the power to decide who is represented at the convention, how they are chosen, and what is on the agenda. https://t.co/0O0rmZonnK 
 Once a Constitutional Convention is called &amp; convened, the delegates chosen by the (R) no longer have to be responsible to the American people &amp; the agenda can be changed immediately Basically, they can do whatever they want to rewrite the constitution as long as 38 states agree. 
 Many states seek to ammend the constitution so that states can override the SCOTUS decisions. Think about it, they could ban abortion, end birthright citizenship, nullify marriage equality, restrict voting rights, destroy programs like Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid ... https://t.co/YuKEyHkOEQ 
 Ever wonder why the Republicans hate programs like Medicaid, Medicare &amp; Social Security? Because these programs are based on a centralized federal level that is in partnership with the states. 
 This allows the Federal government to rule over the states on how the money is spent. A Constitutional Convention could effectively hamstring our Federal government &amp; wipe out these programs &amp; more. 
 Think about this, we are two states away from a Constitutional Convention becoming a reality &amp; right now with Donald in the White House, that reality has an even more chilling note. Do you think this could never happen? The Republicans met in September 2017 for a mock convention https://t.co/AYuGcHjXe9 
 Who wants this? Well the Koch Brothers &amp; the Mercers of course, but there's also a few little hard to trace organizations that are helping to push this agenda. 
 A little company called Citizens for Self-Government (John Hancock Committee for the States) that was given $5.4 million between 2011 and 2015 by the Koch brothers. The officers of the organizations are listed here. https://t.co/ZIuS1tceOV 
 The president is none other than Mark Meckler and is also the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. Here he is with his buddy Sean Hannity. https://t.co/KrhSiZ2ODG https://t.co/d3Bl0p02RH 
 Next stop is an organization called Convention of States. Their website shows an address of 5850 San Felipe Suite 580A Houston, TX 77057. This is a virtual office owned by Avalon Suites. 
 Guess who else is located at this site in suite 575A? the 501c3 organization called Citizens for Self Governance. Turns out that the Citizens for Self Governance is the parent organization for the "Convention of States" 
 Guess who else supports a Constitutional Convention? John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Sen. Tom Coburn, Sen. Marco Rubio, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Sen. Rand Paul to name a few. 
 What do we do about this? Elect Blue candidates at every level. It is important to flip the Federal seats, but equally, no more importantly, the state level seats. These are the ones calling for the Constitutional Convention. These are the seats that will protect our federation. https://t.co/8cVRShqk73 
 All the principles of our federation and the protections of all the citizens of this nation, regardless of the state they reside count on electing Blue candidates in 2018 #VoteBlue2018 #BlueWave2018 https://t.co/Jy6gTtdS5z
