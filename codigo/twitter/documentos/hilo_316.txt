 What or Who is the Senior Executive Service You Ask? The SES is a Deep State is group of over 9,000 appointed 'Mangers' in 75 Federal agencies that control the executive bureaucracy &amp; tell new political appointees what they can and cannot do. https://t.co/kEFe9BcDXp https://t.co/l1ETFsJLXO 
 American Intelligence Media has done a great piece on the ins &amp; outs of the organization and I have included it below. They are rarely talked about but known amongst themselves by this lapel pin. If you see this pin, they are most likely bad news! https://t.co/Zs1QNO0Ibo https://t.co/a9JYBnZW7a 
 These Deep State groups are all about their symbology &amp; this one is no exception. They explain the meaning behind the #Keystone on the OPM website. #QAnon https://t.co/cVjKAeSQyJ https://t.co/701qWQTGyk 
 When we look at the 'Who' think of those who have obstructed @realDonaldTrump &amp; his administration to include his transition team. Evelyn Farkas was Obama's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/EDJVk8nJIp https://t.co/u1ULy59e9b 
 How do I know she is or anyone else is a Senior Executive Service (SES) member is all based on the pay scale and coding for each position. NA &amp; TA are reserved for these SES personell. ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/LS5f91UpGv 
 Evelyn Farkas was Obama's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine &amp; had alot to say about what they actually did while she was part of the SES while in Office on @MSNBC in March of 2017. What they did to @realDonaldTrump &amp; how they did it is now very clear. ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/9vFb4AA3IU 
 The SES goes into 75 departments of the government to include the Department of Justice &amp; The FBI. We start seeing this now that we have the #Key to find the players. One of them just so happens to be Bruce Ohr, who's wife works for #FusionGPS https://t.co/G2jB0SPhns https://t.co/g33IjKHHVO 
 Here is the backstory on Bruce Ohr / Christopher Steele for those that are just tuning in or just starting to pay closer attention to detail. https://t.co/6j1BcatJYE 
 Just to show you how the Special Counsel is comprised, Robert Mueller's top gun prosecutor is none other than Andrew Weissman. He is also part of the SES as listed in the Federal Registry along with David Rybicki. https://t.co/VilInVVBch https://t.co/Pck1RcRor3 
 https://t.co/Xk050SggGL 
 Mary McCord, George Toscas &amp; David Laufman are also listed in the Federal Registry as part of the National Security Division of the SES in 2015. Toscas &amp; Laufman remained as of Dec 2017 in the Federal Registry. https://t.co/JQM4cjD1Aa https://t.co/UEBRgDa4DP 
 George Toscas was in a pinch over the revelation of the Anthony Weiner laptop that included Hillary Clinton's emails with Huma Abedin. He's also mentioned as part of the crew in the Page &amp; Strozk texts released by @ChuckGrassley &amp; @DevinNunes https://t.co/FP7NeP43CK 
 The Lisa Page &amp; Peter Strzok texts &amp; emails start painting a bigger picture as to what exactly Evelyn Farkas disclosed on MSNBC in 2017. https://t.co/Oq8bwECbXo https://t.co/IpW9Z7zT1u 
 This starts putting the pieces of the puzzle together and who the remaining well known players are in the SES at the FBI &amp; DOJ. These people have also stepped down over this debacle! Michael Kortan &amp; James Baker both are out! https://t.co/u6REU7FsPt https://t.co/WEgWlmPxK7 
 FBI/DOJ Co-Conspirators Just Lost Biggest Asset â€“ FBI Director Wray Kicks Out James Baker https://t.co/3IdDcwza0F 
 Other players at the FBI National Security Branch include Bill Priestap &amp; Carl Ghattas. https://t.co/9VaEfrGnDu https://t.co/sy6ZmDKhA3 
 We know that many have stepped down from their posts to include Rachael Band &amp; Currie Gunn. Gun may have also been part of the SES after the 2016 report was released or personnel were promoted &amp; this may be why Band had to step down. https://t.co/G2jB0SPhns https://t.co/Zg0KwYwYsd 
 Rachel Band resignation....ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/YPDREWqxXl https://t.co/UYAEj5mehN 
 This goes all the way back to the top according to Julie Zebrak who has insight into the FBI &amp; an advocate for Moms4HRC https://t.co/PJUT6iCfGI She claims Andrew McCabe is career SES &amp; they can't get rid of him so easily. Andrew McCabe as you can see is claimed to be Career SES. https://t.co/E6623BiRQ1 
 And by TOP I mean Evelyn Farkas &amp; the rest of the Coup D'Ã©tat crew in the FBI &amp; DOJ got marching orders from Barack Obama himself! #ObamaGate https://t.co/WqhZTD3skp https://t.co/linOFEpRkQ 
 I encourage each and every one of you citizen journalist &amp; investigators to dig through the names &amp; departments of the Senior Executive Service (SES) I provided &amp; connect more dots to this Treasonous Puzzle. We need to shut down this program because it is the Heart of The Swamp!!

 Going to add another link for those that want an easily searchable &amp; amazing research tool thanks to Americans for Innovation that you can use to identify Senior Executive Services members. https://t.co/Mh9zzyIWT6 https://t.co/MuFdd9H5OM
