🛑BREAKING🛑 THREAD: Mueller has subpoenaed Trump Org for documents, including some related to #Russia🇷🇺 This is the first known time that Mueller demanded documents *directly related* to Trump’s businesses‼️ 1/ h/t @traciemac_Bmore https://t.co/8bumJZGrZD 
 Note that Mueller didn't ASK Trump for the documents, but instead DEMANDED them via a #subpoena‼️ Mueller slapped Trump w/the subpoena in recent weeks👉🏼ordered Trump Org to hand over ALL documents related to #Russia🇷🇺 and "other topics" he is investigating.😎 2/ 
 This #subpoena likely is how Mueller obtained Trump's *personally written note* to Putin in 2013, that was scanned and emailed as a PDF.😂 3/ https://t.co/ncja6fmpZ3 
 As for "other topics" in the #subpoena, Mueller is probing how foreign money may have funded Trump’s political activities &amp; Team🇺🇸Mueller has questioned witnesses, including NADER (adviser to the UAE), about the flow of UAE's money into the US.😎 4/ https://t.co/XZfM7SsD3y 
 Looks like Mueller crossed Trump's BOGUS "red line" by inquiring about the #TrumpCrimeFamily business, including asking witnesses about Trump Tower Moscow.😂 5/ 
 We *know* that Felix SATER emailed Michael Cohen *at his Trump Org email account* bragging of his ties w/Putin and claimed that Trump Tower Moscow would help Trump’s presidential campaign.🤔 Sater has been an FBI informant for DECADES‼️😎 6/ https://t.co/LhqmJB9nTG 
 Last summer, Sater told friends and family that he and Trump would be *GOING TO PRISON*‼️ And Sater is cooperating, so just imagine how BIGLY BAD this is for @realDonaldTrump‼️🤣 7/ #MuellerTime https://t.co/aJwJXNk3JR 
 Trump’s lawyers are negotiating about Mueller's interview of Trump &amp; Mueller has shared topics he wants to discuss.🤗 His lawyers have advised Trump to REFUSE the interview, but Trump wants to do it b/c he says he's done nothing wrong &amp; can easily answer Mueller's questions.😂8/ 
 And NO SURPRISE, Trump is considering whether to hire on a new lawyer (Emmet Flood), who is an EXPERT in #impeachment‼️ This sure is a helluva NothingBurger.🍔🍔🍔 9/ #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia https://t.co/PeGSKuWe7p 
 The VAST amount of documents ORDERED by Mueller's #subpoena likely includes legal agreements / documents relating FOREIGN DEALINGS, including those in #Russia🇷🇺. 10/ 
 No matter exactly what the #subpoena ordered, it is CLEAR that @realDonaldTrump *HIMSELF* and the #TrumpCrimeFamily are directly under investigation by Mueller‼️ 11/ #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia 
 In addition, Mueller's #subpoena now makes it a CRIME if Trump or his spawn or minions try to destroy evidence‼️😎 12/ #MuellerTime #Busted https://t.co/XZfM7SsD3y 
 Have ZERO doubt, friends. #MuellerIsComing.😎 Trump and the rest of Team🇷🇺Traitor are TOAST‼️ /end #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/GQsr1LWMyS
