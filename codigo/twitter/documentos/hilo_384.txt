1/ #QAnon #Spying #ObamaGate For those who have not followed this closely and are just learning, the very latest post by #Q begins to lay the groundwork for the big reveal, which involves broad, illegal #SPYING by #Obama/#HRC/#DEMs against political enemies, including #Trump. https://t.co/QxyTJtjgod 
 2/ #Q post in 2 pieces [interpretation in brackets]: Apr 22 2018 12:58:19 (EST) Q !xowAT4Z3VQ ID: 195414 1145824 NEW Not ‘official’ product - 5 Eyes. Listen carefully. No evidence to support POTUS targeting. None. [FBI counterintelligence op was NOT based in official intel] ... 
 3/ Part 2 of above #QAnon post #1238: Do you understand the gravity of what’s unfolding? EVIL &amp; CORRUPTION. She had to win at all costs. You know why. How do people support/vote 4 these people?... https://t.co/d3YMqgBIvw Q Screenshot of Post #1238: https://t.co/d9CHYwXavv 
 4/ To repeat: "Do you understand the gravity of what’s unfolding?" Proof will come out that #Traitor44, #Hillary, and the #Democrat Party had weaponized our intelligence services to spy on ALL Americans, targeting those identified as the "enemy"...think Tea Party, #Trump, etc... 
 5/ The reason top brass at the #DOJ/#FBI have tried to hide the initial reason behind the surveillance of #Trump's team was that it was w/o legal merit. They had started the spying years ago. With Trump, the spying went back to at least 2015. They NEVER thought she would lose... 
 6/ Reread this #Strzok text to #Page: “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in [Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s] office—that there’s no way [Trump] gets elected—but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy..." https://t.co/ECHPLsmLkq 
 7/ The insurance policy had two aspects. 1st, they thought it would provide "cover" for all the spying they had been doing on Trump and others...using the FISA courts to uncover "Russian Collusion." 2nd, they saw it as a means to delegitimize Trump, leading to his impeachment. 
 8/ They knew they had a compliant #MockingBirdMedia that would not uncover the duplicity of the faux investigation. They further expected to get enough dirt on Trump w/o trying to nail him...but that did not work...so they PLANTED evidence...people w/connections to Russia... 
 9/ ...such as #Papadopoulos, #Manafort, and #CarterPage. - Papadopoulis repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, tried to schedule meetings w/Russian agents. - Manafort was heavily connected to Russian oligarchs and the #PodestaGroup. - Page was an undercover FBI informant against Russia! 
 10/ Despite these efforts, they couldn't generate evidence of collusion, so the #DOJ hastily overrode a visa block for Russian spy (and #FusionGPS agent) Natalia #Veselnitskaya, allowing her to meet #DonaldTrumpJr in #TrumpTower. The meeting was a trap: https://t.co/U1GPn3LZa9 
 11/ After being denied once by the #FISA courts, the #FBI managed to finally get a #FISA approval to spy on #CarterPage, a negligible figure on #TeamTrump, who never even met or spoke with Trump. No matter. The point of the warrant was legal ACCESS to spy on #TeamTrump. 
 12/ The type of #FISA warrant the #FBI obtained to spy ON ITS OWN RUSSIAN INFORMANT [EMPHASIS], #CarterPage, was the most extreme type, allowing "two-hop" surveillance, essentially totally espionage of ALL communications by ALL involved in Trump's team. https://t.co/N09g2NqXLF https://t.co/XrK3izPIbL 
 13/ And WHAT was the basis of this extreme level of spying on the entire Trump Campaign? It was the #ClintonDossier. This is the proper name for the dossier supposedly prepared by former British spy #ChristopherSteele...based upon 2nd- and 3rd-party input from Russian spies!! 
 14/ In other words, and this is not an exaggeration, the warrant to spy on Trump and his campaign for possible collusion w/Russia was a political hit piece prepared by someone who did not even visit Russia, based on input from Russian assets, paid for by the #DNC and #HRC. 
 15/ So the whole basis for the lie that Trump may have colluded w/Russia is a dossier that #HRC's team at #FusionGPS (paid through #PerkinsCoie to shroud the flow of money). This document was created by HRC's people colluding w/Russian agents to fabricate the fantasy dossier. 
 16/ The truth emerged that the #FISA warrant was issued based upon a politically-fabricated piece of opposition research funded by #HRC. Things got worse for the #Coup #Traitors when it became clear the dossier was not just unverified but factually disproven in many key facets. 
 17/ The problems w/the #FISA warrant increased when we learned the FISA court was not even informed that the dossier was unverified or that it had been funded by #HRC's campaign and the #DNC. Foregoing these disclosures to the court revealed intentional abuse of the FISA courts. 
 18/ #Democrat efforts to refute truth about the #FISAMemo failed as they did nothing to address the points outlined above. It was later discovered, through the #StrzokPageTexts, that the lead investigators had a very cozy relationship w/Obama-appointed #FISA Judge #RudyContreras. 
 19/ As exposure of the fraud perpetrated on the #FISA courts to obtain the warrant against #CarterPage emerged, #Dems were forced to change the "rationale" for the investigation into #TrumpRussiaCollusion. They focused on the investigation starting w/a focus on #Papadopoulos. 
 20/ The problem is, when you lie over and over, the threads in the lie become frayed. The sweater of lies simply pulls apart. The "Papa" story of "having the emails" has no merit. The timelines do not work, per this tweet by @JulianAssange of #Wikileaks. https://t.co/OVD9zPheIl https://t.co/xj5yF0lPRD 
 21/ So this is how we got to where we are today, w/ #DevinNunes wondering what...at all...was the REAL basis for spying on #Trump and his team? The #CarterPage #FISA answer does not explain spying that had been happening earlier. The #Papadopoulis thread has zero merit in the IC. 
 22/ The reason it is so hard to answer this question is that there was NEVER A BASIS TO TARGET TRUMP for an investigation. Not only was there never any collusion w/Russia, there was never any actionable intelligence to posit the theory in the first place. 
 23/ EVERYTHING was fabricated. The idea of #TrumpRussiaCollusion was a fabrication. The #ClintonDossier was a fabrication to help justify this lie. The investigation of #Papadopoulos was a fabrication to move the timeline back to the spring of 2016. Why? Why the need? 
 24/ The fabrication was NEEDED because #Obama, #HRC, the #Dems, and the #DeepState had been spying on American Citizens, all of us, under the guise of protecting us. They had weaponized the intelligence apparatus for political gain, targeting their enemies to maintain power. 
 25/ The targeting of conservatives by the #IRS was just a sliver of the abuse under #Obama. #Obama and the #DeepState had created the database of all databases on ALL Americans, combining data from IC systems such as #PRISM w/data fed by #Google, #Facebook, #Twitter, &amp; #Amazon. 
 26/ Now you can understand what #MaxineWaters meant when describing Obama's #BigBrother #Database, the "kind of database that no-one has ever seen before." https://t.co/OO48aBLyPw 
 27/ Now you can understand why #Trump moved his campaign headquarters across the river from #TrumpTower the day after meeting hero #AdmiralMikeRogers on November 17. 2016...as Rogers informed him of the ongoing wiretapping of Trump Tower: https://t.co/E5TnzOsAI6 
 28/ Now you know that Trump ALWAYS KNEW about #ObamaGate. He was aware from the start, BEFORE he took office, that #Obama was listening in to everything he said or did. While the #LSM mocked, this tweet was #Truth: https://t.co/F3TxNQzH2q 
 29/ Now you know what #Q meant when he wrote today: "Do you understand the gravity of what’s unfolding?" Now you know why they feared Trump's threat to #DrainTheSwamp. Now you know the #Coup was is not a theory. Now we are just filling in the details. /END https://t.co/aABtDJViAD 
 *Now you know the #Coup IS not a theory.* I hate pumping out a thread quickly and finding typos! Please excuse as T does not provide an edit function.
