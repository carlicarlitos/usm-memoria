Hmmm...Q is on the hunt for @Snowden. This looks like it could be Hong Kong. I lived there from 1976-1980. A lot has changed, no doubt, but it sure looks that way. The guy in the center of the crowd could be him? https://t.co/Wh29gBoHmQ 
 2. Q appears to want us to push this hash tag: #internetbillofrights. https://t.co/3QiuaWQ2G0 
 3. Q tells us the #internetbillofrights has nothing to do with AT&amp;T. This scares the Clowns more than anything because they will no longer control the msg. Yes, we have the 1st Amendment &amp; yes, these are private companies BUT they are censoring conservative voices. That's not OK. https://t.co/ZA921vgplV 
 4. Just a theory here but IF Snowden has flipped because he is now, according to Q, a "liability" to Clowns (like JP Barlow, who was 187'ed, became), is Q Team, w/China's assistance helping him clear customs? Is Snowden evading capture by Clowns? https://t.co/nLDiYEdO7K 
 5. It seems pretty clear CLOWNS control social media. Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO) likely wrote the code to censor across platforms. I'm guessing Russia, China, &amp; HK probably were sold this code by ES (or via HRC selling access to her unclass server?). https://t.co/rHiuN6p8JZ 
 6. An anon responding to Q's question "Who performs in a circus?" (I thought the answer was CLOWNS), mentioned Snowden's girlfriend. Q asks who the father is. His name is Jonathan Mills (need to dig into his background). https://t.co/YtGVENCGCu https://t.co/nzrJ6MZ7e7 
 7. Q responds to an anon who had concerns about IBOR. Q clarifies 1st Amendment can't be enforced upon private companies. Yes, they risk losing cash but Clowns make up for it (e.g. OUR TAX PAYER DOLLARS!). There must be a way to prove that if WE are funding, we should control! https://t.co/A0P2C8gWl1 
 8. This anon did a great breakdown of a potential timeline for Q's use of "BOOM" in multiple drops. Sounds plausible. We shall see what happens in the news tomorrow if the ref to "-24" is some kind of op (Snowden extraction from HK?) and only IF the MSM (maybe only FNC?) reports. https://t.co/L193DepFS0 
 @threadreaderapp please unroll.
