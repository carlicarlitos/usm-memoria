üóΩ(1) Hello @SenFeinstein @AdamSchiffCA today you released a chilling letter attempting to bully @twitter into releasing private info but you didn‚Äôt publish that #twitter already told you #releasethememo IS NOT RUSSIAN more importantly they again offered to review the source. https://t.co/Xk3L5GAhdL 
 @SenFeinstein @AdamSchiffCA @Twitter @rising_serpent @Shawtypepelina @IWillRedPillYou @passionchica @Avery1776 @littlecarrotq @BabeReflex_8 @DevinNunes @DaveNYviii @BasedBasterd (2) The source you two have now referenced twice and that every single article about #russiabots uses is #Hamilton68 sponsored by the German Marshall Fund (GMF)and Alliance for Securing Democracy, why didn‚Äôt you write them a letter? #Releasethememo https://t.co/4OllZgMrN8 
 (3) It would certainly be very easy for either of you to approach the President of #GMF she worked for the Obama admin for four years, she‚Äôs quite involved with #Ukraine (see #Schiff largest supporter) her husband well connected in #California #releasethememo https://t.co/YcpmewfM34 
 (4) Perhaps you wanted to avoid involving German Marshall Fund because they give so many grants to #Russia that makes sense because how awkward would that be to explain that your #russiabot stats come from a foundation that pays Russia? Oops #releasethememo (PS- I meant GMF) https://t.co/TR0ATjwNRa 
 (5) In the spirit of fairness we can look at #Hamilton68 a name probably chosen to avoid that tricky Russia connection üòÖ Anyway WOW it was started by a ‚Äúformer‚Äù #FBI guy? Go figure you even got him to testify! #ReleaseTheMemo #NotAbot #SchiffForBrains #SneakyDianneFeinstein https://t.co/rCe70vh9cT 
 (6) But lets get down to the source of the stats shall we? Let‚Äôs look at who you two trusted so much you shot off letters calling American #RussiaBots Here he is! A self proclaimed terrorism analyst with a degree in Literature and Film history WOW, impressive ü§® #releasethememo https://t.co/ys6bw5v5Ap 
 (7) Now for the infamous #russiabot stats that get millions and millions of impressions. THEY are taken from 600 accounts that #Hamilton68 refuses to discloseü§£ why don‚Äôt you take @jack up on his offer to analyze them? Why don‚Äôt you demand their IP‚Äôs ? #releasethememo https://t.co/bTBBBOLxr8 
 (8) Maybe you‚Äôre too shy to ask #Hamilton68 directly so here are some helpful people that sit on their board of advisors for reference! #WeThePeople anxiously await your letters to them about #RussiaBots OMG look #DavidKramer you alresdy know him! #releasethememo https://t.co/SY34MyM84l 
 (9) Who‚Äôs this? @AdamSchiffCA certainly you remember #MikeRogers he also happens to be very against #releasethememo and has such great connections @CNN former @FBI ask him about #russiabots (üîébrought to you by @Avery1776 genius) #notabot https://t.co/J9g4g7Yf8x 
 (10) Maybe @SenFeinstein would feel more comfortable asking a female in that case #NicoleWong would have all kinds of answers (even for #Twitter uh-oh) she‚Äôs got all kinds of connections #Google #DNC bet she knows #crowdstrike #releasethememo üîç- @Avery1776 #GMF https://t.co/1Yn9i5ifKf 
 (11) Well look at these trusty two from the Department of Homeland security surely they would want the 600 #russian accounts exposed so we could get answers right? #Russiabot #ReleaseTheMemo #GMF #TickTock https://t.co/wMVLvvhCDP 
 (12) WOAH! #MikeMcFaul must have some answers former Ambassador to #Russia worked for Obama he‚Äôs even testified before Congress. Gee @washingtonpost @NBCNews are so lucky wonder why they‚Äôve never asked about the 600 #russiabots ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #releasethememo #AdamSchiff #hamilton68 https://t.co/YaZGHlifeS 
 (13) Board of #Hamilton68 is a rabbit hole but back to #GMF remember the President #KarenDonfried she told #Podesta if there was any way to help, please let her know! CUE: #Russiabots #wikileaks #releasethememo üö®What was that about North Korea??TBC... https://t.co/kP6QgJBTqv https://t.co/ydQVtmfDYV 
 (14) What have we learned @SenFeinstein @AdamSchiffCA ? You‚Äôve told the American people #releasethememo is #Russiabots Twitter even said it wasn‚Äôt. You put all your chips on 600 unidentified accounts courtesy of #FBI and Obama adminü§£ #TickTock #NotABot #RELEASETHEMEMO https://t.co/JjKvVIrkpg
