1) Why the Nunes #FISAMemo is just the tip of the iceberg. And a tactical masterstroke by @POTUS. The #Memo isn't a #MOAB bombshell by itself. It's an opening move in a chess game which #Democrats are hopelessly unprepared for, and have already lost. #QAnon #GreatAwakening https://t.co/nfFbeUFCa8 
 2) The path to #DrainTheSwamp is #FBI &gt; #DOJ &gt; #CIA &gt; #Congress &gt; #Judiciary To take down the #DeepState you need investigative power. This is why @Comey was first. The #MuellerInvestigation is a charade, and insiders knew in advance that #Rosenstein was compromised. 
 3) In context, the #Memo strikes as the center of the operatives involved in the #DeepStateCoup which intended to subvert an #election. Any other interpretation is pure idiocy. What's brilliant about it is that it enables #Investigation to move in all direction from it. #QAnon 
 4) There are dozens of #rabbitholes here, and you can rest assured every one will be explored. Make no mistake, this is already an order of magnitude #WorseThanWatergate, and everyone knows this lands at the feel of the former @POTUS. #FISA abuse is minor compared to the rest. 
 5) I can't even begin to name them, there are literally hundreds of directions to #investigate at this point. What @POTUS did is stick one in everybody's face that can't be disputed and makes you sigh and pause. #normies can only handle small bites. 
 6) One that I am personally looking forward to is @SenJohnMcCain who is a terrible human being. Only this disgusting garbage pail would make this headline. Only someone deeply #corrupt would be running scared this way. https://t.co/5XPS225dsO 
 7) CNN reporters are demanding more documents released to prove that the #memo is summarized correctly. What a chess game. Letting them eat their own tail. That is exactly what @POTUS wants, because it will springboard exactly what a pile of garbage we elected in @BarackObama. 
 8) Once more documents become public, all the #coverup from the last 8 years with be on display and indisputable. @EricHolder and @AGLynch are in serious trouble right now. As soon as @SallyQYates starts singing, and she will, the flood gate will open. #QAnon 
 9) There are too many variables for a fool proof plan. If I was @POTUS, I'd have 10 or 12 options clearly flushed out, and wait for #Democrats next move to choose your move. A call to release more #Documents would be a wet dream, and we are already seeing it. #GreatAwakening 
 10) There is a clear long term vision for @POTUS to destroy this #DeepState - "According as circumstances are faborable, one should modify one's plans" - they stepped on a landmine with more documents, by all means do so. 
 11) The next level of devastation will be the Inspector General report, which will elaborate the #FBI and #DOJ behavior in great detail, setting forward a full narrative of the crimes that took place here. 
 12) When things like #FastandFurious, #UraniumOneDeal, #Benghazi, the #IRSScandal begin to get revisited, there will be no hope for #Democrats to maintain their base of support. No #Citizen worthy of respect could stick with people like this. #QAnon #GreatAwakening. 
 13) So for anyone underwhelmed by the #release of the #memo, don't be. This is a thoughtfully calculated entry point into exposing the vast #Corruption in our government. The people you want held accountable will be. Give it some time! https://t.co/vC0qWwzNjw 
 Addendum: I am reading @RepDevinNunes has another memo either written or in the works that elaborates on the #StateDepartment's role in #FISAGate and the #SteeleDossier. This would be a mighty interesting read. #QAnon @POTUS #GreatAwakening
