/1/ ðŸ”¥ "The Dangerous Path" ðŸ”¥ "Big Money's Plan to Shred the Constitution" A research document available from 'Common Cause, Holding Power Accountable' -- I recommend reading this PDF as an aid to understanding the dangers of a Constitutional Convention https://t.co/MCufLuoRU2 
 /2/ From the Executive Summary -- "The threat is a constitutional convention, convened on the petitions of at least 34 state legislatures as specified under an Article V of the Constitution and empowered to rewrite or propose new amendments to that document." 
 /3/ "Its advocates span the ideological spectrum, including right-of-center supporters of new limits on federal power, from a constitutional requirement that the federal budget be balanced" 
 /4/ "to backers on the left of a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Citizens United, a ruling that reversed decades of well-settled law limiting corporate political spending." 
 /5/ "We oppose a constitutional convention because we believe there is too much legal ambiguity that leads to too great a risk that it could be hijacked by wealthy special interests pushing a radical agenda that poses a very real threat to American democracy." 
 /6/ "A convention of states drafted our Constitution [from The Articles Of Confederation] in 1787, including Article V as one of several mechanisms for future amendments." 
 /7/ "Article V itself has never been used but would be triggered once 34 state legislatures submit applications for a new constitutional convention" 
 /8/ "it then requires Congress to convene a new convention to draft and submit new constitutional amendments to the states for ratification." 
 /9/ ðŸš¨ There are no settled rules or procedures to govern an Article V convention and it cannot be limited in scope." 
 /10/ "Though some [concon] proponents say they intend to pass a single amendment â€“ to balance the federal budget" 
 /11/ ðŸš¨ "[...] there is nothing to prevent the convention, once convened, from proposing additional changes that could limit or eliminate fundamental rights or upend our entire system of government." 
 /12/ "Itâ€™s also unclear how delegates would be chosen. If the selections were made by todayâ€™s largely gerrymandered state legislatures, the convention would likely have a decidedly Republican bent" 
 /13/ "Thanks to the financial and organizational muscle, including millions of dollars in undisclosed, tax-deductible contributions, of the corporate-dominated American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)" 
 /14/ "[...] what once seemed impossible is now within reach. And with it comes a great threat to our democracy." 
 /15/ "ALEC, a corporate lobby disguised as a charity, and the conservative activists aligned with it, are pursuing three paths toward an amendment." - Balanced Federal Budget - Compact For America Initiative - Convention Of States For more info refer to the original document. 
 /16/ Key phrases to watch for are "Balanced Budget" and "Independence from Federal Govt". These are nothing more than deceptive conservative words to make the initiation process sound inviting. They're often defended with the good old, "but we'll stop there, of course!" 
 /17/ In truth, republicans, under the paid direction of the #Kochs and other big money and special interests would rewrite the constitution to serve them - and screw the rest of us.
