 In 1954, a baby girl was born, whom the Stasi File identifies as Angela Merkel, today‚Äôs Chancellor of Germany. Her official birthday is July 17, 1954. However, the Stasi file which is currently in the Soviet KGB archives, records her birth as April 20, 1954. https://t.co/7v8oHlQcKV 
 Hitler‚Äôs father, who took the name Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Solomon Rothschild‚Äôs mistress Anna Maria Schicklgruber. 
 Upon receipt of the Nazi files on artificial insemination, along with Hitler‚Äôs frozen sperm, the Soviet Politicheskoye Buro (Politburo) authorized the experiments to ‚Äòresurrect‚Äô, ‚Äòif possible‚Äô, a child bearing the ‚Äògenetic markers‚Äô of Adolph Hitler. https://t.co/V3R9rZof7P 
 Soon after the birth of Hitler‚Äôs baby girl, an agreement between the Soviets, the Americans and the Vatican was arranged. Hitler‚Äôs baby was placed under the ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô of the Catholic Church through its ‚Äòconnections‚Äô with the GDR Lutheran Church which took custody of the baby. 
 She was given a false date of birth, July 17, and the name Angela Dorothea Kasner, daughter of Horst Kasner, a Lutheran pastor, and his wife, Herlind ‚Äì an English and Latin teacher. https://t.co/97ZZbhDDmP

 After the death of Pope John Paul II, the former German Nazi Joseph Ratzinger was nominated. He took the name of Pope Benedict XVI on April 20, 2005, as Vicar of Rome. Is it a coincidence that this date was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs birthday? https://t.co/ByJDQsnXng

 If the Soviet record is true, and the evidence is strong, it opens up some amazing possibilities. The undeniable fact is that Angela Merkel came from obscurity to triumviral power as German Chancellor, President of the European Union, and head of the powerful G-8 economic cartel. https://t.co/kqGmztq7Jj
