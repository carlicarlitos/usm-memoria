Dear @Ashleyfoxmep: I saw you talking about #Brexit on the BBC's Sunday Politics West Country programme on Sunday morning. I was very surprised to hear you say #citizensrights are all sorted when: 1/ 😯 
 a) You have not tried to meet us or engage with any of our concerns at any of the hearings in the EP with @BritishInEurope or @The3Million 2/ 
 b) I assume this means you didn't come to the European Parliament citizens' rights hearing in February, when Jane Golding our @britishineurope Chair outlined some of the same concerns that she then repeated in the BBC package on Sunday? 3/ 
 c) If you had you would know our key concern is that 80% of @BritishInEurope are working age or younger and many need free movement for work which means the current Withdrawal Agreement is **pretty lousy** for us 4/ 😡 
 d) Losing free movement means @britishineurope who are freelancers or who own cross border businesses may need to fill in paperwork and visas after #Brexit which means those who operate on tight deadlines will almost certainly lose out on jobs that come in at short notice. 5/ 
 e) You can read up about what losing FoM would mean for Helen in France, Victoria in Hungary and Dave in Belgium here: https://t.co/4c24ksba8Q and here: https://t.co/nxqHMmXGK8 6/ 
 f) And there are other examples here (we’d be delighted to talk you through them personally): https://t.co/nHHMZMeU1j 7/ 
 g) Now, as a Conservative I am sure you know only too well what a HUGE bureaucratic nightmare red tape is for small businesses. And I am sure you don’t wish this fate on your worst enemies…..let alone the UK’s 1.2 mn #GlobalBritain ambassadors on the continent? 🧐😱 8/ 
 h) Furthermore, did you know that @DavidDavisMP has STILL not replied to our requests for a meeting? If you didn't, perhaps you could use your position as Head of the Conservatives in the European Parliament to help set one up? 9/ 💪 
 i) Presumably you would agree that not making the time to meet 1.2 mn of your affected countrymen (many of whom couldn't vote in the EU Ref in 2016) is a pretty shabby way to treat people? 10/ 
 j) Many thanks and I look forward to your response . ENDS
