1/ #Bitcoin Stages - Price momentum can always be divided into 4 stages -@markminervini -S1 accumulation range (no media/max opportunity) -S2 directionnal trend (&lt;&lt;-- THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD TRADE) -S3 huge volatility (media are nuts/min opportunity) -S4 final mark down/crash https://t.co/Dnoli4R6Q0 
 2/ I told you to look into this article, that was the key for a great trade to do: - Leave S2 behind - Act during S3 that's going nowhere (22nd dec -40% day was the clue for S3) - So you had plenty of time to avoid S4 by beeing invested in it. https://t.co/STlRXRh8Oe
