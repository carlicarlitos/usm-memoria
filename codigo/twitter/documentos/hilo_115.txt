🤡 (1) Twitter has never been all that friendly to conservatives but more than ever accounts are vanishing, week long twitmo punishments handed out, IP bans, #shadowbans and now big accounts are under attack. Spoiler alert: it’s going to get worse and here’s why... #seanhannity https://t.co/bNslzTLrib 
 @rising_serpent @passionchica @KKNoMates @BabeReflex_8 @Imperator_Rex3 @littlecarrotq @BasedBasterd @Avery1776 @Cara_TXZEAL @Thomas1774Paine (2) We all got “the email” the one that basically debunked #RussiaBots but @SenFeinstein &amp; @AdamSchiffCA still wrote a letter (more on that later) BUT did you read the blog $TWTR shared? Because it’s important they informed us they had partners helping now. Who are they? https://t.co/5f3uchGE1h 
 (3) Let’s start with the big fish, Common Sense Media, based out of San Francisco, hugely funded and owned by James (aka Jim) Steyer and guess who his brother is?? https://t.co/STfUrFgETi 
 (4) YES! That #TomSteyer the one who’s spent $20 million in commercials of himself claiming we MUST impeach @realDonaldTrump the Tom that has vowed to pour millions into midterms, the one that has a long relationship with Hillary https://t.co/hiyOeQkckO 
 (5) Wait? Did someone say Hillary, well speaking of her guess who else at Common Sense Media is “helping” twitter decide what’s appropriate??? 👋🏼✋🏼👋🏼✋🏼👋🏼 #ChelseaClinton are you picking #shadowbans https://t.co/ye8txF6vTQ 
 (6) But it’s not just Tom that has it in for all things @GOP because good old Jim Steyer, the owner of Common Sense Media, seems to be quite close to #HillaryClinton himself, how special! #Twitter #NotABot #NotARussianBot https://t.co/4AfHOAlKmp 
 (7) The #SteyerBros are “fearless” and long time supporters of the #ClintonFoundation as well, surely they’re both giving #Twitter great advice🙄 #FreeHannity BTW the list of people at Common Sense Media is a rabbit hole in itself 👇 https://t.co/jh2w3aJ2D2 https://t.co/YCrIo36Bm8 
 (8) Moving right along to the second company helping twitter, we meet the Family Online Safety Institute, another gang of very familiar names, none of which are friendly to conservatives but we’ll focus on the top two #notabot https://t.co/yrF4oPXdiN 
 (9) Stephen Balkam the CEO of FOSI also sits on Facebook Safety board, the Congressional Internet Caucus advisory board, goes way back with the #Clintons AND seems to appear with Debbie Wasserman-Shultz, nothing could go wrong for conservatives with him helping right🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/3GbNkgmzHJ 
 (10) Sarah Holland works for #Google (no explanation really needed) but she assists with algorithms and we all know how that goes. She’s otherwise pretty quiet on social but her likes are clear indicators of who she’s rooting for OH and she worked for a Democrat senator #notabot https://t.co/a8hD3m9gSP 
 (11) The third company twitter users fate depends on is Connect Safely, another non-profit with a rabbit hole list of staff but the CEO Larry Magid says it all. Worked for #Obama analyst for CBS, Huffpost writer (🤣) and again “Safety” for #google #facebook #NOTGOOD #notabot https://t.co/5gXU37erz7 
 (12) Last company mentioned is National Association for Media Literacy (NAMLE) to be fair they seemed the least far left of the four, but let there be no doubt that the director is not a fan of conservatives #shadowbans #FreeHannity #notabot https://t.co/DIToqwVdi9 
 (13) All of the companies have very friendly names and maybe they do good work in other fields but as it stands now Twitter is poised to keep silencing conservatives and if that wasn’t their goal why didn’t they partner with a single place that represents the Right? #WeRemember https://t.co/XTK7BfK3Eu 
 (14) @JamesOKeefeIII exposed the truth about $TWTR and all they did was partner with people that would love to see conservatives vanish. 2018 is supposed to be a great year for social media but will twitter survive if they keep censoring? @FCC should investigate #ByeJack https://t.co/DKwygOayLz 
 (15) BTW #Twitter we’ve been underestimated before and we all know how that worked out. Please stop targeting us, we’re not #RussiaBots we don’t wear masks and destroy cities we judt want #FreeSpeech is that too much to ask? #WeRemember #notabot #RedWaveRisingNov2018 https://t.co/9eeT2CwR5j
