Alexander Nix on tape saying Cambridge Analytica completely ran Trump’s digital campaign and then erased all traces. That’s pretty clearly against the law prohibiting foreign assistance in US elections. 
 “Did you meet Trump?” “Several times,” says Nix. “We did all the research, all the data … all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy." #cambridgeanalyticaUSA 
 #CambridgeAnalytica has taken credit for “Defeat Crooked Hillary … you’ll remember this of course? ‘Crooked Hillary’ in handcuffs.” “You created this?” “Defeat Crooked Hillary, yes." 
 #cambridgeanalytica deliberately targeted Sanders voters to discourage them from turning out or voting for Hillary. “It affected the thought processes of voters,” says Hillary, rightly. 
 “The real question is how did the Russians know how to target their messages so precisely to undecided voters in Wisconsin,” asks Hillary. “If they were getting advice from #CambridgeAnalytica … that indeed would be very disturbing." 
 Alexander Nix says if US government asks him if #CambridgeAnalytica were involved he’ll say “none of your business… they’re politicians, not technical, they don’t understand how it works.” And anyway he’s “absolutely convinced” it’s “beyond their jurisdiction." 
 And now we’re on to self-destructing emails. Two hours later, they disappear. "No paper trail, no nothing.”
