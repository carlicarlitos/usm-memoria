 Livestream: Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing on Worldwide Threats https://t.co/zjuqhHYqaJ 2/ 
 DNI Dan Coats: "We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false flags" &amp; other influence operations. "There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful, and views the 2018 elections as another opportunity..." 3/ https://t.co/qtTstHeKII 
 Sen. @MarkWarner notes that despite Russia's continued efforts to "target and undermine our democratic institutions...the president continues to deny the threat posed by Russia." We need a strong response, and "that response needs to start with leadership from the top." 4/ https://t.co/9HEDwNLLLt 
 Every single leader in the US intelligence community just agreed that there is no evidence that Russian activity (interference) has decreased since 2016/2017, and that they are expecting Russia to continue their activities, including attempted interference in 2018 elections. 5/ https://t.co/FnbyPlsU6s 
 Sen. @MarkWarner asks who or what agency is in charge of combatting Russia's use of social media as a tool of influence/interference. Answer: There isn't one. 6/ 
 .@SenatorRisch says he thinks the American people are prepared &amp; have learned from 2016; says people recognize that there are bad actors trying to manipulate them &amp; will evaluate info more critically. I would invite @SenatorRisch to study my Twitter feed and articles. 7/ 
 Since 2016, more Americans have become witting &amp; unwitting agents of Russian influence. Americans are not prepared for Russian influence operations nor information warfare, and it's dangerous to pretend otherwise. 8/ https://t.co/sGVBs3D6eE 
 Notably, DNI Coats specifically warned that Russia will continue "to use sympathetic spokesmen” as part of its influence operations in the US. Sympathetic voices = Those voices (&amp; bots) that have made Russian propaganda indecipherable from pro-Trump talking points. 9/ 
 Sen. @RonWyden raises topic of security clearances, asks FBI Director Christopher Wray: Was the FBI aware of allegations related to Rob Porter and domestic abuse? Was the WH informed? When were they informed? Who was informed? What was their response? 10/ 
 -NSA Dir. Mike Rogers (responding to Sen. @RonWyden) says he *did* raise concerns about Nunes memo w/DNI Coats. -FBI Christopher Wray indicates he did the same. ... -Wyden asks: Anything you can say in open session? -Wray: We had grave concerns. 11/ 
 FBI Director Wray re. Rob Porter's clearance: We submitted a partial report to the WH in March and a completed background investigation in July. WH asked us to do followup, which we provided in Nov. We closed the file in January. Not good for WH... 12/ https://t.co/th5Cy54GCl 
 Based on FBI Director Wray's response, the White House knew at least something about the allegations against Rob Porter in MARCH. So... the WH has a lot of explaining to do, because that's definitely not the story we were told by Sarah Sanders/John Kelly/Trump/etc. 13/ 
 DNI Coats says anyone w/o full security clearance should not be receiving our country's most sensitive intelligence. That would mean Jared Kushner. 14/ 
 CIA director Pompeo strongly hints that US has retaliated for Russia's interference in 2016 election (&amp; that the Kremlin knows it). Yet he also agreed w/ DNI Coats that Russian interference is ongoing &amp; we should expect more...indicating that whatever we did, didn't work. 15/ 
 I would note that all of the intelligence leaders say the US "is under attack" and "is being targeted" by Russian operations. They're not saying we were attacked or will be attacked again — they're saying we are currently being attacked. Too bad POTUS won't say that. 16/ 
 Sen. @KamalaHarris poses a critical question to FBI Christopher Wray: "Should the president recuse himself from reviewing and declassifying intelligence related to the [Russia investigation/counterintelligence probe]"? Wray: He [Trump] should discuss recusal w/WH counsel. 17/ 
 !!! --&gt; Responding to Sen. @KamalaHarris, DNI Coats says he'd "have to get back to her" but that he "does not believe" there is a written plan for the US intel community to deal with Russian interference via social media. 18/ 
 .@SenJackReed asks intel leaders if they've received specific directives from Trump to combat Russian interference. None cite specific directives. NSA Dir. Mike Rogers says: "I can't say I've been given explicit directives to actively blunt or stop" Russian activities. 19/ 
 .@SenatorBurr says the Senate Intel Committee hopes to have an overview of *some* of their findings by the 2018 midterm elections. Also says the committee plans to have an open hearing on election security &amp; provide recommendations before midterms. 20/ https://t.co/spuJQqydsO 
 Open hearing of Senate Intel Committee is now over. Closed (classified) hearing will be held next. A few notes from earlier that I didn't have time to tweet... 21/ 
 Notable exchange: Sen. Tom Cotton asks FBI Director Wray if the FBI still agrees w/ Comey’s view from last yr that Steele dossier is “salacious &amp; unverified." Wray doesn’t take the bait. Says he might be able say more in closed hearing. Implying that something has changed? 22/ 
 DNI Coats delivered what might be the most striking statement of the hearing: "Frankly, the United States is under attack" and "we expect Russia [to continue] using elections as opportunities to undermine democracy, sow discord and undermine our values." 23/ https://t.co/cgpxHqtXNR 
 It took a little prying, but @SenJackReed's questioning ended with every intel leader admitting that Trump has never given them any specific directives re. preventing, blunting or stopping Russian interference — something they all acknowledge is an ongoing threat to nat sec. 24/ https://t.co/VBaRhhmJhI 
 Notably, Democrats only asked Q's about Russian interference &amp; the integrity of the investigation — I can't think of a single Q. re Trump campaign coordination w/ Russia. GOP (mainly Sen. Cotton), however, tried to throw a partisan dagger in w/ Q's about Steele dossier. 25/ 
 It's clear that intel leaders recognize Russia's exploitation of social media to manipulate Americans &amp; sow discord as a major threat, but DNI Coats said there isn't an agency or point person designated to deal with it, &amp; there isn't a written plan to respond to/combat it. 26/ https://t.co/qPDpIglevy
