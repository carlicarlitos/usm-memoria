💣BOOM💣 THREAD: Team🇺🇸Mueller is probing Trump's #Russian🇷🇺business dealings *prior* to the 2016 campaign‼️ 1/ 👋🏼Buh-bye, Donny👋🏼 #MuellerTime #TrumpRussia https://t.co/3HFxoYWQOH 
 Mueller has been asking witnesses about Trump's #Russian🇷🇺business activities *as he considered a run for president*, including the timing of Trump's decision to run, #kompromot the Russians may have on Trump, and why Trump Tower Moscow fell through.😎 2/ 
 Mueller is probing *beyond the campaign* to explore how the #Russians🇷🇺 INFLUENCED Trump when he was pushing Trump Tower Moscow *simultaneously* while considering a presidential run.🤨 3/ #PutinsPuppet #TrumpRussia https://t.co/X1fPOF0WHt 
 Mueller asked one witness when Trump became serious about running for president. Mueller was *very interested* in when Trump ACTUALLY decided to run and how that COINCIDED w/his #Russian🇷🇺business ventures.🤔 (Hint: Miss Universe Moscow in 2013 😉) 4/ #TrumpRussia 
 Mueller's questioning has centered on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow &amp; unsuccessful negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow👉🏼both partnered w/Aras Agalarov &amp; his son Emin, who "just happened" to arrange the #RussianLawyer🇷🇺meeting w/Manafort, Jr &amp; Kush in Jun'16.🙄 5/ 
 Don Jr testified to Congress that "preliminary discussions" w/the Agalarovs (close Putin pals) on Trump Tower Moscow began after the Miss Universe pageant. Trump tweeted *in Nov'13*👉🏼"Trump Tower-Moscow is next." Bad news for Donny: tweets ARE admissible as evidence.🤗 6/ https://t.co/akhH3ZfA6Y 
 One source said, based on the questions, Team🇺🇸Mueller was focused on the FINANCING of the Miss Universe Pageant👉🏼who paid for what &amp; what money was paid to whom.🤨 7/ 
 Trump Org never disclosed how much it was paid for Miss Universe in Moscow. Trump's lawyers said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary that Trump Org made $12.2 million from foreign sources in 2013👉🏼"substantial portion" came from the Moscow event.🤔 8/ https://t.co/k6KlTZ8ISf 
 Mueller is also probing WHAT HAPPENED during Miss Universe Moscow. Questions focused on meetings Trump had w/#Russian🇷🇺business people or gov't officials, leading the source "to believe the investigators were probing the possibility of #kompromat on Trump.😎 9/ 
 Specifically, investigators are probing *logistics surrounding TRUMP'S HOTEL ROOM in Moscow*👉🏼WHO was there? Who had ACCESS? Who was in charge of SECURITY (Schiller)? Who was moving around w/him during the trip (Aras Agalarov)⁉️ 10/ https://t.co/LKb3ZNjbfK 
 Reminder: the #SteeleDossier reported about the alleged "pee-pee" tape (in actuality, sources tell me that real "tape" is MUCH worse). Indeed, Trump's "use of extensive sexual services" in St. Petersburg, as well as Moscow, is believed to be part of the REAL #kompromat.🤢🤮 11/ https://t.co/so84UzDdWg 
 About 2 yrs after Miss Universe Moscow, TMichael Cohen began negotiating w/another #Russian🇷🇺company for Trump Tower Moscow &amp; Trump signed a etter of intent in Oct'15 DURING THE CAMPAIGN. Mueller's team is probing ALL of this.😎 12/ 
 During the campaign Trump LIED and insisted that he had "nothing to do w/#Russia🇷🇺" even though the prospective Trump Tower Moscow deal fell through *just a few weeks* before the Iowa caucuses.🙄 13/ https://t.co/v5oIC6Yrgk 
 Like nearly everything in Team🇺🇸Mueller's investigation, what is revealed publicly is just the TIP of the iceberg &amp; occurred MUCH earlier. Mueller is ALL OVER Trump's shady business deals in #Russia🇷🇺 and Trump can't bully, bluster, or bribe his way out this time‼️😎 /end
