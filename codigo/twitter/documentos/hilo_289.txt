1) Alright, I've had it. We can't even grieve for our dead in peace before the leftist jackals, celebrity airheads, and tragedy vampires begin attacking our constitutional rights. News flash, morons, #GunControlNow doesn't goddamn work https://t.co/bupe0UIJwx 
 2) There are numerous issues that have to be discussed, so I'll start with the obvious. The left always comes after these shootings to demand all guns be taken away from civilians. But the logic here is: only the law abiding will lose their guns. Criminals won't 
 3) Numerous studies have shown that the only laws that reduce gun violence are concealed carry laws - you know, laws that allow the good guys to carry weapons. Meanwhile, the Paris massacre terrorists still get guns despite strict gun control: https://t.co/ke7TOft3l0 
 4) "Comedian" and failed human being @chelseahandler thinks the NRA is the problem. One problem with your theory Chelsea, the vast majority of mass shootings are at... GUN FREE ZONES https://t.co/7yIevXLY9o 
 5) Akin to herding sheep into a pen, firing all the shepherds, and leaving a sign telling the wolves that all shepherds are banned from getting near the sheep, gun free zones create target ranges for psychopaths https://t.co/cEWDFs1YPA 
 6) When legal guns are allowed: At the Clackamas Mall in Oregon, a shooting rampage by a nutcase with hundreds of rounds of ammunition was cut short when a concealed carry holder swooped in to save the day https://t.co/B6FGYuFY2r 
 7) And if guns are banned... surprise surprise, school massacres still happen https://t.co/9jJC4i2fUq 
 8) Gun control Canada: https://t.co/TxPEkCCoUh 
 9) In Japan, 9 kids died when a psycho ex-janitor Mamoru Takuma entered a school in 2001 with a knife. In 2014 China, 29 dead and 130 were wounded in a mass stabbing https://t.co/uFsRQTVjdb 
 10) Pyschos will always find ways to kill. Without being in the hands of a pyscho, a gun is a paperweight. Place a loaded gun on a table and leave it alone, and it is as deadly as a child's toy 
 11) You then have the attacks on "Thoughts and prayers," from godless freaks. News flash, dumbasses, we offer our prayers to heal the broken hearts of those who suffered losses, and to honor our dead. https://t.co/Wd80ZkaKpC 
 12) And then these idiots trot out the racist argument of "All white people are killers." Since the murderer's name was de Jesus Cruz, are we gonna have to deal with "White Hispanic" again? https://t.co/LU7PfmogSi 
 13) They trot out race, so we have to point out that in Chicago, violence perpetrated by black criminals against innocent blacks killed the vast majority of 650 people in 2017, mostly gang violence. https://t.co/geegJnhs4x 
 14) These school shooters show a trend, usually middle class folks suffering from mental illness. However, liberal organizations such as the ACLU fought in the 1970s to strike down involuntary commitment laws, sending these people onto the streets 
 15) @ThomasWictor makes an excellent point. The only people to blame for these shootings are the psychopath shooters - and the morons who think that it's ok to have a school without armed security. https://t.co/snRPLxxKe4 
 16) Every society has their own variation of these monsters, so don't believe the leftist BS that it is only an American problem. In Europe, people have been beaten down by their own governments so much from serfdom times to now that the psychopathy manifests in different ways 
 17) In 1941, SS death squads rounded up 33,000 jews and took them to a field in the Ukraine called Babi Yar. They then proceeded to shoot them all https://t.co/Ho2HDZ6GLH 
 18) In 2014, ISIS proceeded to duplicate the SS tactics https://t.co/aZubKlOgWM 
 19) In 1970s Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge killed 4 million cambodians in mass killing fields for not accepting communism https://t.co/fMXSY7Wfzo 
 20) Trust me, had Nikolas Cruz been in Nazi Germany, ISIS Middle East, or 1970s Cambodia, he'd be one of those men laughing as he killed the jews, shia, or non communists. I could cite more, like the Tsarist pogroms, the French Revolution, or the Soviet NKVD. All the same 
 21) Nikolas Cruz killed these people. He is to blame, not a gun, not white men, not Donald Trump, not the NRA. A psychopathic monster is to blame. End. Period. Finito. Florida has the death penalty, so he'll be seeing satan very soon 
 22) Get ready for the fire, Nikolas Cruz. I guarantee you'll suffer every bit of the pain you inflicted today 
 23) Addendum: If leftists want to be idiots, then at least get your facts straight. Automatic weapons have been banned since 1987, and pre-1987 automatics require a rigorous federal licence to even own one. https://t.co/6QMaENkB8N
