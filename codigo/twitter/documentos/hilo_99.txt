There's been a lot of talk about #electionsecurity since we know #Russia will try to hack the #2018Midterms. This thread will give brief overviews of #votingmachines, #opensource software &amp; #handmarked #paperballots. THREAD 1/10 #MondayMotivaton https://t.co/U6j62Os6zt 
 Jurisdictions don't have ðŸ’° or staff to buy new machines frequently or keep the ones they have up to date with security updates. There's no voting machine that can't be hacked. 2/10 https://t.co/KnkPnK89nw https://t.co/BOJHc9hbLq 
 Manufacturers &amp; election officials say since the machines aren't connected to the internet, they can't be hacked. But that's not accurate. Polling places transmit voting results using modems. 3/10 #technology #hack #telecommunications https://t.co/uRVrgwo0kP 
 Outdated #technology, missing security patches and transmitting results via modem make all voting machines vulnerable to #hacking. 4/10 https://t.co/dLj4njjbJ8 
 Some believe voting machines that use #opensource code are a better alternative since the code is available for experts to evaluate for flaws. It's also available for #hackers to study and find vulnerabilities to exploit. 5/10 https://t.co/3rEV2JEjFt https://t.co/i4vpMRuZfm 
 Voting machines that use open source code are even MORE vulnerable to hacking since the source code is easier to obtain. Code could be modified and installed on voting machines when they connect to install updates or transmit results. 6/10 #ElectionCommission #electionsecurity https://t.co/ggrufqs33Q 
 So what's the answer? Not JUST #paperballots, but #handmarked paper ballots. There's a MAJOR difference between *hand marked* paper #ballots and *computer printed* paper ballots. Many people don't make the distinction. 7/10 #Hackathon #verify https://t.co/MlLvzMkqHa 
 Attorney &amp; election security advocate @jennycohn1 has researched these issues and has a great thread about the problems with computer printed ballots. ðŸ–¨ 8/10 https://t.co/IiJvRLaJAi 
 She has also researched &amp; written about Ballot Marking Devices. 9/10 https://t.co/DSiBSzIgsd 
 Free, fair &amp; accurate elections are the heart of #Democracy. This is one of THE most important things #THERESISTANCE can do to take back #Congress and get #Dems elected. Call your MoCs &amp; tell them we need hand marked paper ballots! ! 10/10 https://t.co/Vl6wo4biwq
