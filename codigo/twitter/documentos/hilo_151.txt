Folks in my mentions are demanding I explain my response to the #NunesMemo, so: The #FBI was investigating Clinton and Trump during the 2016 campaigns. But while the FBI publicly revealed the investigation of HRC--more than once-- they never revealed investigation of Trump. 1/ 
 If the FBI wanted to go after Trump, as is alleged in this ludicrous #NunesMemo, all that was needed was to reveal the investigation. But instead they kept it super, ultra secret--even to the press, as was made clear with this embarrassing header. https://t.co/WBrdpb5vLs 2/ 
 It took a year and a half for the story to actually break of what happened--"coffee boy" #GeorgePapadopoulos exposed the connections. The #SteeleDossier was never more than a side-trip on the road to indictments. Pretending otherwise just isn't smart. https://t.co/4LlcEHfaV8 3/ 
 We're all worn down by the #MuellerInvestigation. It's a blight on this country that a sitting president is illegitimately in that office. But the #NunesMemo does nothing to move us forward. There's nothing we don't already know. I really expected something dramatic. #MemoDay 4/ 
 After Wray and Rosenstein requested that the #NunesMemo not be revealed, I thought there really was a threat. But it's obviously more that the FBI wanted to limit more conspiracy theorizing and interference in the investigation by Trump. #MemoDay https://t.co/WkIKy3qzDk … … 5/ 
 We are still in the same quagmire. #NunesMemo confirms FBI used evidence from their investigation into #Papadopoulos to expand the #FISA warrant on #CarterPage. This confirms the validity of the FBI investigation &amp; situates it firmly within the #FISA guidelines. #MemoDay 6/ 
 If Trump knew anything about how the US govt &amp; his own DOJ worked,he'd know no #FISA warrant could ever be issued based hearsay. It was #GeorgePapadopoulos who led to the warrant, not the #SteeleDossier. (Yet it's vital to recall that the dossier was never debunked.) #MemoDay 7/ 
 And so here we are, back where we began, with Trump &amp; #GOP trying to blame Hillary Clinton for their actions. They and @FoxNews (and many now-disgraced white male pundits on both sides) are still fixated on her, but she's not the problem: Trump is America's problem. #MemoDay 8/ 
 My concern, now, is about 2020 and the threat to that election. I wrote about it to some degree in today's column, but it was written prior to the memo drop, so doesn't include it. But it does emphasize where the nation really is despite that fantasy #SOTU speech. #MemoDay 9/ 
 Folks on both sides are desperate to see someone arrested and perp walked. The right wants Hillary, the left wants Trump. Hillary hasn't committed any crimes and Trump may not have, either. Regardless, it's mere months till primaries for mid-terms. #MemoDay won't stop that. 10/ 
 The temptation to believe America can be saved by something other than voting is great but as with all temptation, to be avoided. If you want the #GOP out, vote the mid-terms &amp; don't screw up like 2010, 2014 and 2016. Put purity aside and #FlipTheHouse. We must rout the GOP. 11/ 
 2020 is more concerning because what we DO know from the #NunesMemo is just how far Trump and the #GOP are willing to go. And they have their full complement of disinformation services right here on Twitter, with help from Wikileaks and FaceBook. #MemoDay 12/ 
 We also know that #GOP #VoterSuppression is a concomitant threat and impacted the votes in PA, MI and WI. So it's not just the #MemoDay reveals of GOP collusion--it's the GOP itself. https://t.co/h80AuM42mN 13/ 
 It's very easy to lose focus witheach new shiny object. That's all #NunesMemo is. Remember only one president has ever been removed from office. Voting is the way out. Starting now. https://t.co/TXN8JAJQRN 14/
