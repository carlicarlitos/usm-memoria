1. #QAnon drops some real inside baseball tonight pertaining to #Q's foretold D5 Avalanche which began today. #Q #CrossfireHurricane https://t.co/tUF6XNWEY7 
 2. #QAnon's drop begins with reference to the meeting held in the White House today. #Q https://t.co/qWhQcagxYA https://t.co/hNvnAKzrNk 
 3. The meeting #QAnon cites was pre-planned, though not on the public schedule (saving more students' lives that way?), planned to take place IMMEDIATELY after new CIA director sworn. Kelly added as surprise? FBI Dir Wray, DOJ Rosenstein, &amp; Dan Coats're there. "Think timing #Q" https://t.co/hKv3SiOv0H 
 4. Compared to #QAnon's "Full Disclosure. General Statement", the White House issued public statement about the meeting: IG's now tasked to expand investigation to include any irregularities w FBI’s or DOJ’s tactics concerning the Trump Campaign". #Q #CrossfireHurricane https://t.co/cdlgMY1RJZ 
 5. #QAnon's drop in a sense expands from the public statement the White House issued about the meeting, but first Q characterizes it as a "Military OP. [Green] General K [JFK] #Q" https://t.co/AbJyO4jgUU 
 6. #QAnon says we are engaged in a Military Operation (OP). Military oversight is needed because the corrupt aspects of the Hussein structured civilian intel agencies have committed the criminal acts that are being investigated. #Q https://t.co/J8diT4Hn8y 
 7. #Qanon reveals a [Green] light for General Kelly [JFK] to spearhead full disclosure of the truth of our country's (and foreign country's) intel op against Donald Trump. #Q 
 8. Some've suggested that "[Green]" could refer to #QAnon's earlier post on Capt Mike Green who's killed in a plane crash during a military op concerning the Rothschilds. But whether this arcane notion is spurious awaits further confirmation. #Q https://t.co/pGEXGuxxO3 
 9. In response to #QAnon's drop, one anon notes that the IG is authorized to require the production of information by subpoena. #Q https://t.co/RWsal9NQIZ 
 10. Compred to the public statement released on today's White House meeting, this is the #Qanon one: "Once the 'extremely guarded &amp; highly classified' information is finally revealed to House investigators, DNI, public etc., RR must recuse or [be] forcefully terminated." #Q https://t.co/YJStQtK0aK 
 11. #QAnon's been telling us of "RR Problems" for a while now. What was Rod Rosenstein's Senate Conf Vote? He was confirmed by a vote of 94-6, compared to Sessions' very narrow margin. The #DeepState swamp trusts Rosenstein. #Q https://t.co/1CMSP3XYK0 
 12. #QAnon: "WRAY reports to RR [important fact]." FBI Director Wray reports to the Deputy AG (Rosenstein). A man we trust reports to a man we can't trust. #Q https://t.co/k3GdptOMVS 
 13. #QAnon asks if "[RR] recuse/fired who has direct oversight of Mueller? Sessions un-recuse or #3 [until refill]? Who is Rachel Brand? Why was Rachel Brand dismissed? Think timing. #Q https://t.co/05I67LlInE 
 14. Rachel Brand was on #QAnon's recent house-cleaning list. #ClownMedia said she left for an offer too good to pass at WalMart. #Q said she was forced out. #Q https://t.co/tlgy2XPZEj 
 15. #QAnon quotes article noting that the President may choose someone else already Senate-confirmed in the exec branch (e.g. Pruitt) or Sr DOJ lawyer to serve as “acting” AAG in Brand's place &amp; so to act in RR's place on temp basis for up to 210 days. https://t.co/e0OtPV6MwT #Q https://t.co/PDIJnSR9rD 
 17. #QAnon: "210 days"? The 2018 mid-term elections are 168 days from now. "Think timing. "Acting" These people are stupid. #Q" 
 18. #QAnon links to the DOJ page for our current Acting Associate Attorney General, Jesse Panuccio, but (cf above link) "because Panuccio is not Senate-confirmed, he would not act as attorney general (or deputy attorney general) if those offices were also to become vacant." #Q https://t.co/8SwwLvxwpF 
 19. #QAnon's link to DOJ page: https://t.co/ZNQz1wcsF8 #Q 
 20. So, bottom line seems to be that #QAnon is noting that @POTUS hasplenty of time left to appoint an acting replacement for Rachel Brand, someone Senate confirmed who could act in RR's place. #Q 
 21. #QAnon: "Why is Schneiderman's removal is 'extremely' relevant? TRUST (name). #Q https://t.co/GRrl5YEtR9

 25. @threadreaderapp please unroll this latest #QAnon thread here: #Q #CrossfireHurricane https://t.co/xoz7uIccbC 
 26. #QAnon: Why'd #Q refer to John F Kelly, &amp; put the initials [JFK] into target brackets, when "JFK", obviously, implies something else? More meaning? Is #Q not saying that military has green light for Op to thwart the #DeepState coup attempt? General Knowledge. Full Disclosure. https://t.co/7zBxtnLCSE
