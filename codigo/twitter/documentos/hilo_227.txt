1/ #QAnon #Fal$eFlag Consider: 1. #Trump says he wants out of #Syria. 2. #Assad has essentially won. Why create an event to draw a response? 3. Immediately after Trump tweets about leaving Syria, there is a #ChemicalAttack. 4. #Israel attacks Syria last night. Ask WHY?? 
 2/ Anyone who has been following things can see that the #DeepState wants #War. WHY? Military-industrial complex. Oil. and worse (depopulation). Too hard to believe? Look at the patterns (now and in the past)...do they fit? 
 3/ #Trump works out a deal w/#NK (back in November)...after our October bombing took out their major nuclear facility and 200 scientists. As background, the #DeepState was using #NK as a puppet regime to hold us hostage...they wanted #WAR. https://t.co/oFUvQv1JwG 
 4/ Knowing how the media will react, #Trump directs provocative tweets at #KimJongUn during this time frame. The #LSM take the bait and predictably call for Trump to tone it down and create peace. They essentially side w/#NK, known at the time to be an unstable, nuclear threat. 
 5/ Now that #Trump has effectively brokered a deal to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the #LSM should be heaping praise upon #POTUS. After all, this is what they said they wanted. Wrong. It's hard to find positive media coverage of this. Google: https://t.co/awrNDFyKF6 
 6/ Isn't this win in #NK a win for the #US that must be celebrated? Not according to the #DeepState and the #MockingBird Media. The #LSM has two key talking points in their narrative: 1. Trump MUST fail...never shown to have success. 2. We MUST go to #WAR! 
 7/ With #NK off the table, the last hope of the #DeepState is a #WAR in the #MiddleEast. They focus on #Syria as the epicenter. The problem is that #Trump tweeted that we are pulling out. Something MUST be done...hence the #FF #ChemicalAttack we just saw over the weekend. 
 8/ Trump KNEW they would take the bait and do exactly what they did. He's exposing their evil, so he tweets the following right after this event, with this key phrasing in part 2 of the tweet: "Open area immediately for medical help and verification." https://t.co/fHBJePgbbm 
 9/ With his tweet, #Trump has neutered the media. #Trump knows that they CANNOT provide verification that #Assad is behind the #ChemicalAttack. It was done by bad actors associated w/ the #DeepState that wants war. 
 10/ At the center of much of this and the US-created #ISIS is #NoName #Traitor #McCain. Those who moved off of the #LSM have known about McCain's connection to ISIS for some time. The #DeepState is now scrambling. 
 11/ Snopes (a leftist propoganda arm) had labeled a McCain-ISIS connection "FALSE" in the past. I had personally visited the page, &amp; the picture they showed was different than the one they show now. They're so sloppy they have yet to clean the following reference to the picture. 
 12/ Snopes tried to clean its tracks in the archiving systems, so there were NO archives available for this page. I just created one (below): https://t.co/4VmnLuoruv 
 13/ Snopes is scrambling, so they have not cleaned the page fully. Clearly, the phrasing doesn't match the actual picture: "A photograph taken in Syria in 2013 shows Senator John McCain posing with a commander of a Syrian opposition group, not ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi." 
 14/ Here are some of the incriminating pictures showing #McCain meeting w/ #ISIS leaders, such as leader al-Baghdadi. https://t.co/pjoKG9YNxF https://t.co/aoTZP9Syd0 
 15/ Back to the original question: WHY did #Israel bomb #Syria last night? I see two possible reasons that seem logical now: 1. To try to escalate things to pull us into a war w/ #Syria. 2. To destroy evidence of their (#Mossad) involvement in the #ChemicalAttack (speculative).. 
 16/ With this as background for those not following things closely...or getting their "news" from a lying media...now you can learn more from a deep-inside source that has been highly reliable yet mocked by the #LSM, namely #QAnon. https://t.co/eSrLGwR5GJ 
 17/ Now read this #QAnon post: Apr 8 2018 00:48:59 (EST) Q !xowAT4Z3VQ ID: d6f611 947065 They are trying to start a war. Deflection. Public interest shift. Pullout announcement. Chem attack. Coincidence? These people are sick. #Q Happy Hunting! /END https://t.co/4uSa1LGm4N
