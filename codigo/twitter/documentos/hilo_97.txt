New Q post on /ga/ board. Looks like DoJ will be busy investigating the REAL election interference/voter fraud. Looking forward to reading their findings some time next month! https://t.co/sfsAG6YMm0 
 2. Just a reminder that the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity was handed off to DHS in January. The draft memo Q posted will have those blanks filled in. Heads are gonna roll! https://t.co/cjNbjq0r7e 
 3. LOVE this!! Q just posted this image...file name: "Just_Waiting.png". Tropical setting...like...maybe...Florida? GTMO? Timing is everything! #QAnon #DOITQ https://t.co/mF4C9BrTKV 
 4. An anon created this to show Q's original drop w/the link to the EO on the Establishment of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity &amp; this DRAFT memo about the DHS report due out next month. https://t.co/PZ48cK0xZu https://t.co/qTucqog5nP 
 5. Someone shared this w/me earlier &amp; tonight an anon posted it on the research board. Q confirms this is "BIG!". Author William Cooper was killed in shoot-out w/police. https://t.co/qurDKKnZf9 Book discusses CIA use of drugs/hypnosis on mental patients. https://t.co/khPcrlzlvU https://t.co/rvyWZMB0d9 
 6. Q seems to be telling us that the legit intel role of the Clown Agency will be assumed by No Such Agency. JFK will finally be able to rest in peace. SA&gt;Rothschild&gt;Soros pyramid will collapse. Nothing left but a hollow shell of what they once were (how I'm interpreting this). https://t.co/fnAOXYsvj5 
 7. Perfect tribute meme to JFK by an anon. https://t.co/zvyRMX7j8s 
 8. This drop from 9 Nov confirms my #6 tweet in this thread. Clown Agency being dismantled. Ops to go to No Such Agency. https://t.co/z8yp8zds2D 
 9. Heads up to our UK friends: Q just posted a photo w/filename "NSA_Traf_CAM_LONDON2847.png" with a warning to UK to stay alert. https://t.co/A5joBItURj 
 10. Q just posted a warning to UK about a possible car attack. Chatter appears to indicate this is imminent. For reference purposes: on the 14th of Feb, Q dropped a similar post but it was more broad as a EU warning. https://t.co/A5AIbTB3AS 
 11. Ref my last tweet (#10): The previous warning indicated the EU attack was 72 hours away. This one narrows it down to London in the next 24 hours. 
 12. When Q posted the first EU warning on 14 Feb a UK anon posted this a few times. Sharing this just for SA (situational awareness) as it could relate to Q's warning tonight about a possible London attack within the next 24 hours. https://t.co/2hcyYl4BTU
