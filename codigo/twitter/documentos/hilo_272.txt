1. There’s a lot surfacing that suggests that #ReleaseTheMemo will produce the following rather devastating revelations about a massive criminal cabal leading all the way to the Oval Office. Let me give you a teaser of the memo here. #TheStorm #GreatAwakening #WeThePeople 
 2. It involves both the breach of the DNC emails, as well as the famous piss-gate dossier that has been at the heart of the entire #RussiaCollusion narrative from the start. 
 3. The memo will show that #SethRich, a Bernie-supporting DNC staffer, copied their emails and send them to #Wikileaks to blow the whistle on Hillary’s rigging of the DNC to destroy Sanders. 
 4. Barrack Obama, James Clapper and rogue elements in the CIA found out about Seth Rich using illegal surveillance prohibited by the 4th amendment. Anywhere up to 12 separate people were involved. 
 5. Google funded the IT auditing company Crowdstrike with $100M that was the entity used to run a sham investigation of the DNC server. The FBI’s help was refused and they bizarrely stepped down without a fight. 
 6. Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO, was fired for using Google as a powerful surveillance tool by criminal elements of the CIA. Crowdstrike was used to carry out the master plot of cheating Donald Trump out of the presidency. https://t.co/kTKRcTtwEi 
 7. Anyway, they bust Seth Rich and decide to make an example of him to prevent future leaks. He was assassinated using the cabal’s hit squad, MS-13. Look how scared Donna Brazille was when she realized. https://t.co/pXlXEeVTdm 
 8. Debbie Wusserman Schultz was the one who shut down the investigation into his death, and they get assistance in making it all go away from the corrupted FBI and CIA leadership. 
 9. Now it’s Peter Strzok’s “Insurance Policy” in his text messages. This is a plan to create a phony dossier to enable the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump Campaign to find dirt to stop him from taking over the government and exposing their crimes. https://t.co/YP25ODFm9n 
 10. A lot of bad people involved. Obama, Hillary, head of the Justice department Loretta Lynch, James Comey, Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok, all conspiring to create this dossier. 
 11. They even hired British Intelligence to help them. People just have no clue how corrupted all the vessels of power and intelligence in this world has been compromised by this global cabal, but it would shock anyone who opens their minds enough to realize it. 
 12. The money for this dossier came from Hillary’s campaign, the DNC treasury, the Podesta Group and other classified entities who paid Christopher Steel through Fusion GPS. Tried to obscure the flow of money… unsuccessfully. 
 13. Steele gets fake dirt on Trump from the Russians, he passes it over to corrupt Attorney General Eric Holder who, with some other classified coconspirators, starts the FISA application. 
 14. Massive high five for the cabal. They now get FISA authorization from corrupted Loretta Lynch and begin spying on Trump. 
 15. Obama gets daily briefings and has a nice listen to all their private conversations in the hope that Trump is as crooked as they are. Unfortunately for them, he is not, and they can’t find a damn thing connecting Trump with Russia. https://t.co/n62vUfFSDk 
 16. John McCain, a convenient cabal operative in the Republican senate, starts sending this fake dossier to the #FakeNews media, and Buzzfeed is the only outlet stupid enough to get involved with this scam. https://t.co/bnHg9wM3W6 
 17. It is leaked and the public get to hear for the first time the #RussiaCollusion fantasy cooked up by the entire rotten Obama administration in their desperate attempt to stop Trump from taking the seat of power and exposing their crimes. 
 18. When they #ReleaseTheMemo, the public will discover not just that this whole Russia collusion story is scam, but all the horrible crimes they’ve been committing for decades that they knew Trump would expose. 
 19. America was almost destroyed by criminals, but they’ve been busted. Now the public needs to be ready for the fall of a criminal enterprise on a scale that is quite incomprehensible for most of us. https://t.co/p0EQCb4jfA #TheStormIsHere #WeThePeople #GreatAwakening

 20. And I didn't even mention the separate crime campaign, the charade investigation of Hillary's shocking abuse of classified materials that led to her inevitable exoneration. #TheStorm #GreatAwakening #ReleaseTheMemoNow https://t.co/cAlsHZ4TOS
