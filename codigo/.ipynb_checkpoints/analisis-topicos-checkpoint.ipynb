       " 'Given the fervor now surrounding it, it\\'s interesting to revisit how \"The Star Spangled Banner\" became the National Anthem. \\n You\\'d think based on the ferocity on the right, the country was born with that song attached to it (like ... I dunno ... slavery). Not true! \\n The Francis Scott Key ditty about a war no one remembers (the war of 1812) did become a popular military jingle after the Civil War. \\n Military bands would play it at events, and it would be played at patriotic picnics etc, but the country still had no national anthem. \\n Then in 1915, the daughter of Woodrow Wilson (Democratic president, unreconstructed racist) recorded the \"banner\" song and it became a hit. \\n The recording cracked the top ten in sheet music sales in 1915, part of the rah rah toward the end of World War I. https://t.co/BTBAnYfZt9 \\n So like any doting dad, Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order making his daughter\\'s hit song the national anthem. https://t.co/3tO2YWk3DM \\n He could have picked any other song: \"My Country Tis of Thee\" was also popular at the time. But he liked his daughter\\'s hit song the best. \\n Probably didn\\'t hurt that the Francis Scott Key song was pro-slavery, given Wilson\\'s venal racial views ... https://t.co/sEzzJxZcV4 \\n Anyhoo, congress pretty much ignored Wilson\\'s order, and the anthem remained informal until 1931, when a law was passed codifying it. \\n That law was signed by a guy named Herbert Hoover, who probably saw it as a feel good headline to replace ones like\\x85 https://t.co/vtQmOTxeyY \\n The bill to make \"The Star Spangled Banner\" the national anthem was introduced by a Maryland congressman (total coincidence, the song refers \\n to took place off Baltimore Harbor. And there was LOTS of pushback, esp since the tune was an old drinking song. https://t.co/GpLpvSsDF9 \\n And it was considered too hard for the average person to sing -- too many octaves. \\n People also thought there were better options, like \"America the Beautiful\" and other popular patriotic songs: https://t.co/V5F5PZeFFJ \\n And that debate didn\\'t end before or after it was designated. https://t.co/2TmsNE4M2P \\n In other words far from revering it, Americans kept arguing over whether there even should be a national song, and if this was the best one. \\n Personally I could make a very strong case for \"America the Beautiful,\" which is a prettier song, and more inclusive, but I\\'m just on TV... \\n Bottom line: people act like that song was handed down by God, or by the military. It wasn\\'t. It was decreed by a POTUS hyping his daughter. \\n Meanwhile, it had absolutely NOTHING to do with professional football, which began with the creation of the NFL ... in 1920. \\n IOW, 13 years before that song was the national anthem.',\n",

       " 'THREAD. I see a lot of people asking how people who can\\'t legally purchase guns end up with them. The answer is complex, but important. \\n 2. Let\\'s start with the law. Federal law prohibits people who fall under 11 listed criteria from purchasing a gun. \\n 3. This includes convictions for domestic violence, narcotics, or legal adjudication of mental illness (among others) \\n 4. Federal law also requires a background check for anyone purchasing a gun at a federally licensed firearms dealer. \\n 5. The federal database against which background checks are conducted is called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) \\n 6. However, many of the disqualifying criteria, like domestic violence or drugs or mental illness, fall under state law \\n 7. This means that NICS is only as effective as the information that states (or the military) provide to it, for inclusion in the database \\n 8. In many instances, this information fails to make it into NICS. The VA Tech shooter had a mental health adjudication -- wasn\\'t in NICS \\n 9. Dylan Roof, who also shot people worshipping in a church, had a narcotics conviction -- not in NICS \\n 10. So why not just search state records? Well, a S. Ct. case called Printz v. U.S. ruled that the feds can\\'t force state LEOs \\n 11. to conduct state background checks. (If they did, most of this would come up.) Rather, states have to \"volunteer\" to do this. \\n 12. Currently, only 13 states \"volunteer\" to do this for all firearms. Three do it only for handguns. And three do it only for permits. \\n 13. So there is Leak #1. In addition, the fed background check only applies to federally licensed dealers, not to private transfers \\n 14. Only nine states require background checks at the point of transfer from any dealer: CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, NY, NV, OR, RI, WA \\n 15. Some others require it only for handguns, or for permits. So there you have Leak #2. Basically the \"secondary market\" is wide open. \\n 16. Here\\'s where stolen guns come into the picture. Fed law does not require the reporting of stolen firearms. Only 9 states do for all guns \\n 17. So there\\'s Leak #3. This allows straw purchasers -- legal gun buyers -- to buy guns and \"accidentally\" lose them, and never report it. \\n 18. Not only are the vast majority of guns used in crime stolen (not used by the legal owner), but they can be traced back to 1% of dealers \\n 19. But -- get this -- feds not allowed to say who they are because of a 2003 law preventing it. \\n 20. And, FWIW, some states disproportionately contribute to the stolen gun pipeline (from 13-18% more than the lowest contributing states) \\n 21. So that\\'s just a broad outline of how $#&amp;@ up our regulatory system is. Bottom line: If you want a gun, there\\'s a way to get one.',\n",

       " '1/ I feel a little better about Bernie\\'s CNN stunt now that McCain is a no but to be clear this is a terrible situation for Democrats \\n 2/ A Jim Comey level of terrible. I refer you to the first 45 minutes of Morning Joe yesterday. You can watch it on demand. \\n 3/ And it\\'s more than my usual \"why is Bernie speaking for Democrats\" primal scream \\n 4/ Bc now instead of discussing what\\x92s wrong with Graham Cassidy, convo shifts to why it\\x92s at least better than \"Berniecare\" \\n 5/ It should be Conyers-care but this is Bernie we\\'re talking about, so Bernie-care it shall be, and that means \"socialism\" \\n 6/ I\\x92m going to get flamed about how it isn\\x92t socialism but calm down, I know this and I agree with you, but that\\x92s not the point \\n 7/ To the GOP, Obamacare is socialism, even without public option, so m4a is unfathomable to them. \\n 8/ Yes, calling it socialism is a scare tactic, but it\\'s a scare tactic that works. Might as well say communism. Many have. \\n 9/ Some ask, why would Collins and Murkowski be swayed by Bernie and you\\x92re right, they wouldn\\x92t. The issue is framing. \\n 10/ When they start polling m4a vs Graham-Cassidy instead of ACA vs Graham-Cassidy and the GC numbers increase... \\n 11/ If &amp; when support reaches critical mass in their states, Murkowski and Collins will have no choice but to vote for repeal. \\n 12/ GOP only has until the 30th to repeal ACA under reconciliation. After that it takes 60 votes. They def don\\x92t have 60 votes \\n 13/ But they might have 50, which is why the timing is problematic. And suspicious. Why not wait one week? \\n 14/ This is also a problem for m4A, if you want that to succeed. This \\x93debate\\x94 will allow Graham to savage m4A as introduced. \\n 15/ m4a that everyone signed onto isn\\'t really legislation, it\\x92s an outline. There\\x92s no funding mechanism. It hasn\\'t even been scored. \\n 16/ Even if McConnell wanted to hold hearings tomorrow a completely new bill would have to be drafted. \\n 17/ So when Bernie goes in bumper sticker slogans, no funding mechanism, no CBO score, Graham will eviscerate him \\n 18/ He\\x92ll have an independent score and a takedown of the most unappetizing funder they can dream up \\n 19/ He\\'ll arguing worst case scenario strawmen and terrifying projections, tax implications, shortages, and worse. \\n 20/ Since our side has nothing, charges will be impossible to refute, and will be on record for 2018 political ads against Dems \\n 21/ Once Graham exposes its flaws, the bill it will be DOA no matter what happens with ACA, and we\\x92ll have to start over \\n 22/ As I said, we\\x92d have to start over anyway, but this will bring that \\x93momemtum\\x94 Berners like to crow about to a screeching halt. \\n 23/ So to recap, this debate is bad for Democrats in 2018, bad for the future of m4a, bad for everything except what? \\n 24/ *all together now* Feeding Bernie\\x92s ego \\n 25/ All we\\'re asking for is 7 days.

Once I started respecting people enough to consider THEIR beliefs &amp; actions, I changed. \\n (4) When people of faith encourage others to pray for others it\\'s bc often there is nothing they can do directly. They\\'re not there. Also... \\n (5) When a person of faith hears that someone is praying for them, it usually brings them comfort. Yet SJW atheists dismiss that effect. \\n (6) The Left calls Trumplicans \"lacking in empathy\" yet a solid case can be made for THEM lacking in empathy. Esp the SJW atheists. \\n (7) What greater empathy can there be than to seek help from the Creator, on behalf of someone else, in a way that brings comfort. \\n (8) Here\\'s a saying that triggers SJW atheists incredibly: \"There are no atheists in foxholes.\" \\n (9) Perhaps the meaning of \"There are no atheists in foxholes\" might be: When the SHTF, human nature is to seek higher meaning. \\n (10) I can guarantee you, many SJW atheists feel extremely uncomfortable when you question whether their atheism would survive a foxhole. \\n (11) For SJW atheists, their lack of belief hasn\\'t been subjected to mature, logical scrutiny. For a conservative atheist, often it has. \\n (12) It takes mental and moral courage to really examine your beliefs or lack of beliefs. SJWs, by definition, have undeveloped beliefs. \\n (13) There is no such thing as social, economic, environmental or reproductive justice. There is only justice... which is often elusive. \\n (14) SJWs define justice in childlike terms. Justice is whatever makes them happy at the time. Bradley Manning is a great example. \\n (15) To Bradley Manning, \"exposing\" what he believes are \"war crimes\" justifies giving sensitive intel to our enemies. Manning is not God. \\n (16) Military men and women with more intellect, training and lawful responsibility determined that the intel must be kept secret. \\n (17) It\\'s not for Manning or any other misinformed SJW to determine what intel should be kept secret. He swore an oath to follow orders. \\n (18) But to an SJW, even military authority is open to question. Manning believes his sense of \"justice\" supersedes lawful authority. \\n (19) Even Christian SJWs believe they can supersede lawful authority. Despite the New Testament\\'s clarity on the matter. This is bc \\n (20) Christian SJWs are moral relativists. And don\\'t say \"they\\'re not real Christians\" either bc as I was taught, that\\'s not for us to judge \\n (20) Moral relativism is a scourge on humanity. Atheism makes it more likely in a person but anyone can do it if they are a sloppy thinker. \\n (21) None of this fascinating discussion is possible with SJW atheists, though. They are fundamentalists like those they criticize. \\n (22) People have to come to a place of insight themselves, pushing them only drives them away. Many SJWs have eventually seen the light. \\n (23) I just see it as my \"calling\", if you like, to work for our side, mature people with empathy who use logic and evidence. \\n (24) I hope that by sharing my story of transformation from SJW to conservative you will be encouraged that there is always hope. \\n (25) Prayer does work. It brings comfort, fellowship &amp; hope to the hurting. Something \"social justice\" can never do. #PrayForTexas \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nEND',\n",

Test it: hold your arms out, index finger\\x85 https://t.co/BYT6VsRbKJ \\n This, by the by, is why you can\\'t see your eyes move in the mirror. Whenever your eyes are in motion, they\\'re effectively turned off. \\n No (or minimal) motion blur when you saccade. Why? Because your brain suppresses visual input during saccades. Low-\\x85 https://t.co/qYjFf5M0KM \\n But wait. Saccades are *long.* (I mean, relatively speaking.) They can last anywhere from 1/20 of a second to 1/4.\\x85 https://t.co/jGvHFq9t6F \\n (This suppression is useful, a valuable shortcut, just like optical illusions. If you know you\\'ll never get visual\\x85 https://t.co/fDkVgt4B9Y \\n That\\'s where our clever and wicked brains sneak in, once again filling in those gaps. Let\\'s walk through the Stopped Clock Illusion. \\n The clock is working correctly, ticking along at the crowd favorite rate of one second per second. https://t.co/TUCiLqINxO \\n Your brain then fills in that gap in your experience by BACKFILLING the final image over the preceding fraction of\\x85 https://t.co/ZX8CQC6JtC \\n You glance at the clock. By chance, your saccade occurs right over the moment when that second-hand was in motion. https://t.co/twdLYRVtLa \\n As they say on the twitters, \"let that sink in.\" It explains the Stopped Clock Illusion: you perceive the second-ha\\x85 https://t.co/C66o1cbBCn \\n \\x85but look at how your brain achieves that! It can shuffle and stretch sensory input without respect for chronologic\\x85 https://t.co/KWBr0SfSDE \\n I repeat: you don\\'t notice the brief moment of saccade blindness because your brain backfills the FINAL image over\\x85 https://t.co/2HABaUBV5H \\n To me, this inspires humility. Our subjective experience should be the ultimate thing where we alone know best!

       " 'The new Republican talking point\\x97radio, TV, White House\\x97is any critique of conservative public policy is an attempt to \"divide the country.\" \\n 2/ Let\\'s be clear: the motto of The New Fascism is, \"Don\\'t divide the country.\" It\\'s a way to intimidate dissenters and *end* public debate. \\n 3/ Have a problem with the current debate surrounding police brutality? *Engage the debate*. Only a fascist says \"Don\\'t divide the country.\" \\n 4/ Trump voters laud his candor, but his \"Don\\'t divide the country!\" rhetoric masks a cowardly unwillingness to say what he really believes. \\n 5/ And what does Trump really think? That the NFL should\\'ve given him a team and he doesn\\'t give a *damn* about police brutality either way. \\n 6/ We\\'ve been hearing \"Don\\'t divide the country!\" from Rush Limbaugh, from Donald Trump, from Paul Ryan, from Republicans across the board. \\n 7/ We started hearing this New Fascist slogan well before Colin Kaepernick took a knee. The far right uses it on *all* controversial issues. \\n 8/ It\\'s an Orwellian way of seeming to support unity while aggressively preventing the open dialogue that allows a lasting unity to develop. \\n 9/ If Donald Trump weren\\'t a coward, he\\'d have Huckabee Sanders just come out and *say* Trump thinks there\\'s no police brutality in America. \\n 10/ Of course, saying what you think allows a debate to unfold. Opting for pure rhetoric instead is a fascistic technique\\x97and has long been. \\n 11/ The best part? Trump\\'s base has *long* had, as its animating issue, the notion that the New Left is squashing public debate and dissent. \\n 12/ There may well be elements of the New Left that use such tactics. But they use them less often\\x97and less successfully\\x97than Donald Trump. \\n 13/ The perverse paradox of Trump is, he wants to be loved but if he ever said what he really thinks he\\'d discover America isn\\'t behind him. \\n 14/ America *doesn\\'t* support him not caring about policy\\x97it *doesn\\'t* support him using the flag as cover for his vendetta against the NFL. \\n 15/ It *doesn\\'t* support him using \"tax reform\" as a cover to enrich himself as he does virtually nothing at all for middle-class taxpayers. \\n 16/ To be honest, I don\\'t think his base even supports him avoiding the police brutality issue using cowardly, empty nationalistic rhetoric. \\n 17/ The Trump voters I come across online are angry\\x97they *want* to debate police brutality, not spout a \"Don\\'t divide the country!\" bromide. \\n 18/ That\\'s why I call this \"The New Fascism\": what lies behind it is a fear the far-right position isn\\'t strong enough to withstand debate. \\n 19/ Trump wraps himself in the flag as a way to hide his personal motives but *also* his unwillingness to debate the police brutality issue. \\n 20/ I think both Left *and* Right should reject the falseness and cowardice of Trump\\'s \"New Fascism\" and just debate the issues at hand now. \\n 21/ When I hear\\x97say\\x97Limbaugh replace *zero* facility with the facts of the police brutality debate with empty rhetoric, it\\'s just grotesque. \\n 22/ It also suggests that the Right has *no* response to many Americans\\' concerns about police brutality, and *that* should anger the Right. \\n 23/ \"Class warfare\"; \"dividing the country\"; \"election butt-hurt\"\\x97one side of our national political discourse collapsed into lame bromides. \\n 24/ Anyone who\\'s upset about \"PC culture\" destroying public debate should be *equally* upset about empty rhetoric destroying the same thing. \\n 25/ If you love the flag and think it\\'s being disrespected, defend that view with *studied positions on police brutality*\\x97not fascistic pap. \\n PS/ Actually no, because Trump has yet to take *any* position on police brutality\\x97which is what we\\'re talking about. https://t.co/Cu3D0PbcMe \\n PS2/ Unless, of course, you count him telling a large gathering of police officers that they should definitely brutalize all their suspects. \\n PS3/ Afterwards he said, clearly falsely, that it was a joke\\x97further proof he doesn\\'t have the courage of his personal/political conviction.',\n",
