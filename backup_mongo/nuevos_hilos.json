Think of people's authority as running in lanes: Lane 1 - Accuse the evidence Lane 2 - Prosecute the evidence Lane 3 - Judge the evidence Understanding these roles of authority is how we can discern the truth from the lies and distractions created by those hiding it. 3. This tweet summarises it perfectly: https://t.co/qammKB2q6i 4. Mueller's role was to gather evidence and determine if there was enough to prosecute a case before a jury. It is not the role of a SC to determine guilt or innocence. I provide more detail about Mueller 'leaving his lane' in this thread:👇 https://t.co/pXjSbzVeke 5. Those who are running out of their lanes are becoming more obvious: - former agency directors (Brennan, Clapper etc). - former Obummer staff - meeting with foreign countries without official roles. - H'wood actors calling for Trump's impeachment. 6. Looking at the world through this lens will reveal those trying to expose the truth and those creating noise in order to distract everyone from seeing the truth. This noise and distraction is created by those running out of their lane of authority.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"1032936199340486656"},"id_str":"1032936199340486656","name":"Burn Notice","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"15262"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1063"},"created_at":"Fri Aug 24 10:22:35 +0000 2018","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"4557"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"6"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"151"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"538"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"25"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"90"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.03891"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

Video inside article. https://t.co/bFfJiQ5Sik U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra, in a 33-pg opinion, said that the evidence he reviewed showed that Jeffrey Epstein had been operating an international sex operation in which he and others recruited underage girls, not only in Florida, but from overseas. “Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him.,’’ wrote Marra, who is based in Palm Beach County. “Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.’’ Instead of prosecuting Epstein under federal sex trafficking laws, Acosta, then the U.S. attorney in Miami, helped negotiate a non-prosecution agreement that gave Epstein and his co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution. Epstein, who lived in a Palm Beach mansion, was allowed to quietly plead guilty in state court to two prostitution charges and served just 13 months in the county jail. His accomplices, some of whom have never been identified, were never charged. I do not know what will happen next, but I plan to follow this case. I sure hope these victims will see justice, and others involved with Epstein will be charged.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"809974521746911232"},"id_str":"809974521746911232","name":"Corey Lynn - Corey's Digs","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"47657"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"326"},"created_at":"Sat Dec 17 04:12:29 +0000 2016","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"26938"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"6"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"595"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"913"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"99"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"152"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.33108"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

You never hear \"ANANGO\" publicly but that is what y'all noisy Nigerians are called. Ghana does not have good food but they have the best women. Another contradiction.

Large slaveholders in coastal areas also moved enslaved people around the state to avoid the Union Army &amp; therefore Emancipation. The confederate states fought a war for the right to own human beings but Texas fought *two* wars for this reason. Conflict over American whites bringing enslaved black people into Mexico, which had abolished slavery in 1829, was a factor in Texas seceding in 1845. The Texans were hardly alone in their attempts to stall Emancipation. When Northern states began abolishing slavery after the Revolutionary War, slaveholders would wait until shortly before the last day of legal slavery and then sell their Negroes to buyers in slave states. In other instances slavers simply moved across state lines, taking enslaved people out of a territory where Emancipation was occurring to one where slavery was protected. French slaveholders did the same thing in Haiti during the Revolution, taking slaves to Louisiana. Texas efforts to stall freedom were not unique, they were part of a bigger pattern. There are lots of Juneteenths. Finally it’s worth noting that the order of Emancipation delivered on 6/19/65 also ordered black people to continue to work the same “jobs” they did as slaves. The order also warned them that “idleness” would not be tolerated, reflecting Northern/Federal concerns about what freedom for black people meant practically. Mitch McConnell pointed to the civil war as a kind of reparations for black people. But everywhere that freedom came it reflected the prerogatives and interests of powerful white people. Emancipation came 2.5 years late. Equality is 156 years late and counting.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14155907"},"id_str":"14155907","name":"jelani cobb","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"195448"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1626"},"created_at":"Sun Mar 16 02:54:24 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"27116"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"7"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"9465"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"23715"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1352"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3388"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.25636"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

Rule 6(e)(3)(D) creates a national security/foreign intelligence exception that applies here. 1/1 The exception, added in the wake of 9/11, allows DOJ to share grand jury information, without a court order, “involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence” to federal law enforcement, intelligence, national defense/security officials to assist them in their duties. The exception also allows DOJ to share with those officials grand jury information involving threats of attack or “other grave hostile acts” or “clandestine intelligence” activity of a “foreign power” for the purpose of “preventing or responding to such threat or activities.” Based on the exception’s plain language and purpose, members of the House Judiciary and Intelligence (and other) Committees qualify as federal law enforcement, intelligence and national defense/security officials to whom disclosure can be made without court order. The Mueller report grand jury information likewise plainly qualifies as information involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence and threats of attack and other grave hostile acts of a foreign power, and sheds light on how Congress can stop and respond to them. Accordingly, Barr may disclose the redacted grand jury from the report to Congress tomorrow. No court order needed — he just needs to notify the court of the disclosure within a “reasonable time” after making disclosure. On April 1 we filed an application for @rcfp invoking this exception and asking the Chief Judge to tell AG Barr he can disclose the information to Congress. We welcome the House to join our suit or file its own, but it has a right to this information now, with no court approval.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1130070541"},"id_str":"1130070541","name":"Ted Boutrous","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"18430"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1723"},"created_at":"Tue Jan 29 04:46:16 +0000 2013","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"3636"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"7"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"8656"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"24164"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1237"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3452"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.00685"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

And I'm really bothered about the way the death of the 7-year-old child is being reported. You're placed in a hielera if you enter at a port-of-entry. You're placed in a hielera if you cross without authorization. To prominently claim that this child crossed \"illegally\" IN YOUR LEDE is offensive and serves to grant major leeway for her death. To claim that Border Patrol regularly serve food and water to people in hieleras is a serious stretch of reality and it indicates to me you don't talk to people about hieleras and rely instead on what the administration is telling you. Hence your narrative. Here's a cropped @jbmoorephoto from a hielera. This is the water people are forced to drink. It's grey and it's disgusting. It routinely makes people sick.

But I also must point out that brow-beating and nagging is also work, and telling women to do more of it adds to women’s unfair work load. The reason women do more work is simple: Men force them into a binary choice. You either a) do the work all by yourself or b) nag him. Most of the time, A, while exhausting, is less exhausting than B, which makes you miserable as well as tired. In addition, men punish women for nagging. They withhold affection, mock women, and in worst case scenarios, abuse them. This is why I call it the “nagging differential” and it is, in my opinion, the main reason domestic labor differences persist. The problem here is a sticky one: The only way to get men to do their fair share is for men to choose it themselves. Otherwise, most women will pick “fine, I’ll do it all myself” over “I will spend my time and energy on the miserable task of nagging”. And why should men self-motivate to do more chores? They don’t have to and most have ready-made excuses for why they force their wives to do it. “It means more to her.” “I work harder and make more money.” “She’s better at it.” So women say, “Well, it could be worse. So I’m grateful,” because they are trying to cope with a problem that has no real solution. Men aren’t going to get better unless forced. Women don’t have the energy to force. So here we are.

But Mueller couldn’t bring charges because a Justice Department policy says you can’t charge a sitting president. That policy is wrong and needs to go. Here’s how and why. The Mueller report is a clear roadmap for impeachment, because that’s the only path Mueller had. But impeachment shouldn’t be the only way that a president can be held accountable for committing a crime. No president should be above the law. So why does this Justice Department act like he is? Because in the 1970s Richard Nixon’s Justice Department wrote a memo saying so (yes, really) and DOJ has continued to stand by that view. Congress should pass a law clarifying that DOJ can indict the president if he or she commits a crime in office, and should amend our obstruction of justice statutes to explicitly allow for indictment when the President abuses the powers of the office—like Donald Trump did. One of the strongest arguments against indictment is that the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to decide when to interfere with the President's duties. These new laws would eliminate that argument and remove any statutory ambiguity. Attorney General Bill Barr has disgraced himself by acting like Trump’s personal defense attorney. When I’m elected, I will appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one—not even a president—is above the law. And I’ll go one step further: I pledge to nominate an Office of Legal Counsel head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a president cannot be indicted for criminal behavior. The OLC’s purpose is to govern the conduct of the executive branch, not act as the president’s get-out-of-jail-free card. Our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable. These changes will make sure that’s the case for generations to come.

Putin made Eric Holder the A.G. so that he could make sure that white collar crime would never be prosecuted, while we filled private prisons with black men for arbitrary bullshit Putin made the Obama administration spend it's entire last two years in office on the TPP, which was actually terrifying for people whose families relied on one good heavy industry job.

And many former US government officials know for a fact that what I've just said is true. 1/ Whatever you think VP Dick Cheney was to President George W. Bush, take that, make it 3 times as sinister, make Bush 10 times more sociopathic and a devout criminal, and make Cheney stupid, venal, and entirely dismissive of our rule of law and you get what Kushner is to Trump. 2/ Kushner is going to get us into a *devastating* war with Iran. Jared, singlehandedly. Jared, to make money for himself. I'll say now that Jared more richly deserves to be in prison for the rest of his life than Manafort, and Manafort richly deserves it. That's how bad this is. 3/ I'm wondering today more than I ever have before whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller has spoken to one man: Rex Tillerson. For all that Tillerson presented a danger of a corrupt detente between Trump and Putin, I think he knows *now* exactly how dangerous Jared Kushner is. 4/ Don't believe anything you hear from Kushner's attorney or from Kushner. *Ever*. The latter will always be lying to you, and the former will either be lying to you or will have been lied to by his client. I don't know if Mueller can save us from this particular danger or not. 5/ Whether you realize it or not, Kushner having top secret security clearance is *the* issue in American politics right now, as Trump circumventing our intelligence community to give his son-in-law that access is the shibboleth that made the current danger to America *possible*. 6/ Our foreign policy is totally off the rails in a way that is dangerous, and the sole reason for this is the Kushner-Trump axis. Our values have been betrayed in ways that we may shortly feel so keenly our heads will spin. We need whistleblowers to blow their whistles now. /end PS/ The extent to which you think that Jared Kushner does or does not keep things from his wife is precisely the extent to which you think that Ivanka Trump is complicit in covert actions that should, if there's any justice, put Jared Kushner in prison for a very, very long time.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"3223426134"},"id_str":"3223426134","name":"Seth Abramson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"676351"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"38"},"created_at":"Fri May 22 16:19:26 +0000 2015","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"53065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"8"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"24371"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"71007"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3046"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"8876"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"2.25011"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Anger"],"emocion_max":["Anger","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

I've heard from candidates who were turned away from Stan's office and (incorrectly) told to deal directly with the Democratic Party at the county level. This is fundamentally wrong. During the primary, the party has limited engagement with candidates other than setting the ballot. This so that every candidate has an equal shot in the primary and ensures transparency. I’ve also heard from friends that they’ve made endless calls to the County Clerk’s office because they have not received their mail-in ballot and are deeply confused with how to vote without going to the polls - this is especially important for older folks who really do need to send in a mail-in ballot. The behavior of the County Clerk’s office is concerning. ((BEWARE TEXAS VOTERS)) I applied for mail in ballot along with my husband only to wait 2 weeks and receive an application instead. It needs to be signed sent in and then you have to wait for your ballot. I have heard many are still waiting on their ballots or have not received them Due to this same issue. 30,000 Democratic ballots sent out have NOT been filled out and returned. Several entities sent out annual application requests for ballot by mail to voters who needed to sign them and return to the election Dept. They look like junk mail, voters MUST sign and send out before they can get a mail in ballot sent back. Applications require the voter's signature and returned to the election department. It is now too late to apply for ballot by mail for this election. But you can send in a signed application for the rest of this year's elections as long as you check the box for the annual requests for ballot by mail. We see you and we we will not be stopped. Stop trying to suppress the democratic vote. We will not be stopped from voting. Texas go vote and check on your elders and disabled family and neighbors. They might need some help getting their ballots in this year. Remind them about signing the Application for the ballot and mailing it in ASAP. Pleas make sure they have their voices heard.

We should compensate tenants much better than we do today when they're displaced to build higher-density housing, and that new housing should be held to minimum standards of affordability -- otherwise why redevelop at all? https://t.co/Rzt5n6elr5 The goal of Ellis Act reform shouldn't be to stop redevelopment, but to discourage it where the difference between existing bldgs and future projects isn't that great. Replace a duplex with 40 units including 6 affordable? Awesome. Replace 20 units with the same? Not so much. One very important note: This can't be used as an excuse for demonizing developers who build something we desperately need: housing. Even market-rate housing is almost always accompanied by affordable units nowadays, and it costs the city nothing; we need it all. And when we reform Ellis to make high-displacement developments less feasible, we need complementary reforms that make low/no-displacement development easier. We need upzones. Single-family neighborhoods near high-quality transit are the obviously-best choice. I also believe we should eliminate the Ellis Act owner/family move-in and conversion to non-residential use provisions, and sharply, *sharply* restrict the ability to convert to condominiums. \"Going out of the rental business\" shouldn't result in a windfall profit to the owner. Further, Ellis Act payments should be required whether or not a rental unit is occupied. This would discourage underhanded tactics where landlords try to get tenants out of their units *before* filing their Ellis application. Tenants should get what they're due. I still think there's a place for voluntary buy-outs of tenants, so long as they're reported by the property owner -- no off-the-books deals. Some tenants' lives will be better off with a $50,000+ buyout than a permanently rent-stabilized apartment. Let them choose. We can dramatically strengthen tenant protections and increase the supply of homes at all incomes levels -- at the same time. They work better together. Tenant protections to keep things from getting worse, new housing to actually make things better. Both are essential. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"573346594"},"id_str":"573346594","name":"Shane Phillips 🚶‍♂️🏘🌳🌇🚉🚲🛴","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"2995"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1394"},"created_at":"Mon May 07 06:09:16 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"17102"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"8"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"41"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.83882"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

As I pointed out yesterday, the budget discussion has been disingenuous at best, and irresponsible and misogynoir at worst. The relationship between the royals and the UK government has been heavily negotiated. Meghan does not make budgeting decisions. https://t.co/3n5yIkFL5p Her marriage to Harry did not change the amount of money that flowed to the RF. The Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster as well as the royal lands go back centuries. Whether this is a wide arrangement or not is a question for UK citizens to determine but its existence has nothing to do with Meghan. The state of royal housing, and the requirements for renovations to historical housing also have nothing to do with her. All of that to say that she should have been low on the list of headlines. Despite all their gaslighting the RRs and editors cannot help themselves, so they always fallback on their stock narratives. We already know how this story goes: 1) woman of color is used to sell product, 2) the sales pitch is that said woman of color is undeserving of wealth (or is angry or is uncouth, etc). Any discussion mention of Meghan in these headlines or stories is disingenuous because: (1) she just came on the scene and did not negotiate the agreement between the RF and the government, (2) the sovereign grant is based on a percentage of profits and is not tied to Meghan's entrance to the family, (3) the renovations on Frogmore were going to happen regardless of whether the Sussexes moved in or not, (4) on the scale of royal extravagance this is modest, (5) the expenses represent a tiny percentage of the expenditures on renovations, etc. I could go on but I think I've made my point. There's a mixture of misogynoir, laziness, greed, xenophobia, classism etc. here that results in Meghan being at the center of the action and blamed for problems which existed long before her birth. And that's how structural racism works. There's likely no one evil person behind the scenes causing this but the result of years of action and inaction is that we still end up with women of color screwed in the end. Even when their ancestors were in chains when a lot of these decisions were made.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"946230307023413254"},"id_str":"946230307023413254","name":"Goldburn P.

Take action immediately before they get a strong foothold. Very few exceptions to this rule. Tipoffs you are early in attack lifecycle.

The file was therefore infinitely larger than before. At some point, somewhere (not sure where) it was decided this was poor engineering, probably because the shell spends time reading that big SCCS header as a comment one byte at a time.

Eventually to avoid the unbearable overhead of executing a comment that shouldn't be there at all, someone rewrote true as a C program. What was once an empty file is now a non-portable executable binary compiled from C. This is why we can't have good software. This program could literally have been an empty file, a nothing at all, a name capturing the essence perfectly.

Your Mom has been raped for the 5th time. While your Dad has recently escaped from the Cartels army recruitment forces. In your families shack on the outskirts of town, you wake up ... to the sound of your parents holding each other and crying. Soon your parents are packing up your 3 shirts and 2 pairs of shorts in a sack with a rope on it. Along with some water and food. For the long and dangerous journey north to the land of the free. To the shining city upon the hill, where the lady stands in a harbor welcoming everyone to this land made of immigrants. Where all people are welcome and treated like people instead of cattle, or worse. To keep hope alive on the trip, your Dad talks about your cousin in America. Whose joining the American Marines, to pay the country back for taking them in and protecting them from the cartels. What seems like months of traveling north, your parents basically dragging you across the sand and heat. While giving you their last bit of water and food. Yet the whole time, your parents were smiling with pride for the choice they had made to take this chance. Rather then stay and die at the hands of the cartels army. They chose to take the chance to find us a better life. After all the miles, the desert and the incredible heat. You and your parents make it to the American border Then with violent hands of people whom hate their jobs. You and your parents are separated and taken to different internment camps. Literal tent camps fenced and barb wired in to contain migrant children. Your forced to eat uncooked frozen food. While sleeping on concrete floors inside cages. Some kids get drug away by the same guards and when they bring them back the kids are crying and lay curled up in the corners holding their bellies and bottoms. Other kids are really sick and have no one to take care of them so a few older kids try to take care of them. Made to wear the same clothes for weeks at a time. While not being able to take a bath or a shower and when you do get a shower its ice cold water with no soap. Kids ask where their parents are. Some guards laugh at the kids and tell them their parents sold them to America and went back home. All the kids cry themselves to sleep every night. This is Trumps America.

She called out his impaired mental condition without saying \"dementia.\" His condition worsens every day so she can’t be wrong &amp; Trump denials can’t be right. Going forward, Pelosi statements will appear more correct w/ each passing day 2 When a Dementia patient tells ppl how smart they are, it’s typical mid-stage ranting. When they say they are fine, but someone else is mentally ill, like Trump did w/ Pelosi, the patient is entering their final public days. Pelosi opened the floodgates for others to speak out. 3 Trump revealed his dementia denial process on the WH lawn, when he said a/b Pelosi, “Did you hear what she said about me?\", “She said terrible things”, “You think Nancy’s the same as she was? She’s not. Maybe we can all say that.” The last sentence is the tell. He's in denial. 4 “Maybe we can all say that” is Trump’s twisted denial that his dementia is just normal aging. It’s not. He's rapidly deteriorating. Btw- Pelosi’s brain is working just fine &amp; Trump hates that. She’s smarter, faster &amp; schooling him on a regular basis. The mismatch crushes him 5 Pelosi has destroyed Trump’s health cover up charade. “Intervention\", \"pray\", \"well being,” are all keys words that shout \"Dementia.\" She sincerely feels &amp; knows he should resign &amp; get help. It may be a reason she’s held back the impeachment guns. Ppl in govt know Trump is gone 6 Fighting it never works. Barr will break the law, but he hasn’t discovered a cure for dementia, which means Trump is SOL. Posting fake videos of Pelosi only makes Trump look sicker. It doesn't slow what's happening to him- relentless deterioration from Frontotemporal dementia. 7 When the dementia patient has “the car keys taken away” (metaphor for losing authority), a wide range of reactions occur. I’ve personally witnessed patients be: 1 Cooperative &amp; accepting 2 Angry &amp; screaming 3 Highly violent My guess is Trump will be angry &amp; screaming non stop. 8 Fortunately the Secret Service will be able to keep Trump under control.

With respect and ethics. See? That wasn't so hard. For example: In my novel, THE SYMPATHIZER, I culturally appropriated Ralph Ellison, T.S. Eliot, and Homer IN THE FIRST CHAPTER. I went on to culturally appropriate Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, John Le Carré, Philip Roth, Francis Ford Coppola, and more. I felt I could do so BECAUSE I HAD STUDIED THE WESTERN TRADITION and read and reread the sources I wanted to allude to or appropriate. That's the thing--so-called minorities like myself have to know THE SO-CALLED MAJOR TRADITION, the CANON, and we have to know our own tradition. This is the way cultural appropriation should work. When someone doesn't know a tradition and steals from it or shows it disrespect--that's negative cultural appropriation. That doesn't mean there can't be criticism of the tradition you appropriate. See the section in THE SYMPATHIZER on Hollywood filmmaking. I satirized the shit out of Hollywood because I've been watching its good and bad stuff my entire life. How many people of the majority can claim they've spent their entire lives studying another tradition? A few. I can respect those people as long as they don't claim that they're speaking for another tradition, one that they don't have to live in. Lastly, appropriation is not just majority to minority or vice versa. It works across so-called minorities in the same way. I wrote a short story from an African American bomber pilot's perspective in THE REFUGEES. I felt I could do so because I spent a great deal of time reading African American literature and studies, as well as the memoirs of American soldiers and pilots. Appropriation may or may not be right word for every act of borrowing, allusion, or identification. Because I made money off these writing acts, however, appropriation may be the right word. I took great care in doing so, including studying the ideas and perspectives of my sources. I READ EVERY SINGLE BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA BEFORE I SATIRIZED APOCALYPSE NOW. How many American directors who have made movies about the war in Viet Nam can say they have read a dozen books from Vietnamese perspectives?","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"88498742"},"id_str":"88498742","name":"viet thanh nguyen","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"29305"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"517"},"created_at":"Sun Nov 08 20:14:49 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"6349"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"9"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"236"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"2107"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"26"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"234"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.20263"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Surprise","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

All of my followers are aware of the Raniere ruling yesterday in the NXIVM case. Sadly, many sheep are not. Let’s analyze how the media giants “covered” this story. 2) For starters, let’s look at the tweets from CNN, NBC, NYT and WaPo. I want you to focus on the wording of the headlines and the number of likes/retweets. I will break down each one individually. Keep in mind, these MSM giants only tweeted once about NXIVM yesterday. https://t.co/07xyZr5wdQ 3) @cnnbrk @CNN you are pathetic. A “self-help group that prosecutors say housed a secret sex cult”. Prosecutors didn’t “say” that. It was a sex cult. They were branded like cattle. Raniere was FOUND GUILTY on all counts in the court of law for TRAFFICKING HUMANS. 410 retweets. https://t.co/XvIOaQ9Svn 4) @NBCNews NBC at least calls the sex cult for what it is, and properly includes in the headline the “minor” details about SEX TRAFFICKING AND CHILD PORN. But this isn’t enough. No mention of dem 2020 candidate @SenGillibrand father being an employee of NXIVM. 147 Retweets. https://t.co/LrvvDmvxbE 5) @nytimes At least calls it a sex cult. Given the new ruling, it should be labeled a human trafficking organization. No mention of the charges on human trafficking, child porn production and possession. No mention of the NXIVM recruitment parties or daycares. 2,035 retweets. https://t.co/CxiV5gLGY3 6) @washingtonpost makes it seem like he was a nice guy. THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY OF TRAFFICKING HUMANS. His “company” was running 11 daycares worldwide. Richard Branson, James Alefantis, Anthony Weiner, Eric Schneiderman; all attended NXIVM events. Crickets... 42 retweets. https://t.co/tmdeD7PG2a 7) Now, lets juxtapose the tweets from the 4 liberal media giants vs a random 26yo grunt. Currently sitting at 8300 RTs. I have 3.2 times the amount of RTs of the big 4 COMBINED. And they have a combined 106 million followers... I have 15k.

We will do it our damn selves. 9) This is a Public service announcement to the MSM: Your lack of coverage of the NXIVM case is disturbing. You are covering up for pure evil. I have single handedly overtaken you and I am one of many. You are relieved of your positions. Signed, We the People.

Surely the IC and FBI are aware of this. Why aren't alarms going off? Why has it been allowed to progress? Where is the deeper investigation of these relationships and how deep the compromise might have run. This seems like another fun story about our sleaze bag president. But it's more than that. It is a story of how foreign actors (&amp; perhaps how domestic actors) gain leverage over the president. Consider this for a moment: If the Steele dossier had contained speculation that the president &amp; his family were giving access to a Chinese woman who runs a string of sex spas.. ...in Florida, where rich, powerful friends of the president were getting sexual services would it have been any less shocking or disturbing than stories about golden showers w/Russian hookers? In fact, given that it continued long after Trump became president, it would be worse. Add to that the fact that the Chinese president is supposed to be coming for a summit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the site of the influence selling operation of this Chinese madam/Trump crony/GOP donor, and it all makes for quite the tableau doesn't it? This story will, we can be certain, contain more revelations. But it is not just a shocker in its own right. It is a symptom of one of the many serious ailments with which Trump and his presidency suffer. His sordid predilections have opened him up to blackmail. Every foreign government knew that just as they knew they could buy his favor with deals and flattery. They knew it before he was elected and there is evidence to suggest that the intelligence community heard chatter to that effect. Trump has therefore been a national security liability and, to the extent he allowed himself to be manipulated by those who were willing to deal in this kind of leverage--like the Russians, the Saudis and others--he has put the US at risk and severely damaged the office he holds. p.s. I seemed to have missed the story that, apparently coincidentally, Xi yesterday cancelled the Mar-a-Lago Summit. I regret the oversight.

It was a packed room, and yet no one seemed to see. I say 9 or 10 years old because the truth is I can't remember if it we were ringing in 1990 or 1991. I don't remember if there were 50 people in the room or 100, just that there were a lot. I don't remember his name or really what he looked like. But I do remember his open mouth. I remember the dress I was wearing so clearly in my mind, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn if I was wearing something else entirely. I don't remember where my parents were. I don't remember the music, or what happened earlier in the evening. But I do remember his open mouth. I didn't tell my parents about it, not for years and years. The memory was sickening, but I didn't think it counted as 'real' assault. Just a kiss right? And he was a family friend! I didn't want to cause drama. But I always remembered his open mouth. If I were, for whatever reason, called on to give evidence about that moment and that night I'm sure even a sub par legal team would be able to rip holes in my testimony. To present me as an unreliable witness, with dates that didn't line up and inconsistent timelines. It would be easy to do. Because I don't remember everything about just one of the 'inappropriate' things that was done to me as a kid, and I can't recall the exact details of something that happened 28 or 29 years ago. But I do remember his open mouth. I could never forget that. I consider myself lucky in comparison to others. But it boggles the mind to know that 'inconsistency of timelines' is one of the many arguments apologists use to discredit survivors like those of Pell. I don't doubt for a second that man remembered the details that counted. And to be clear, I don't categorise what happened to me as even remotely in the same field as what Pell did to his victims. All I'm saying is I know that the kernel of a memory can't be discredited by the wispy details that surround it. And a room or environment being 'busy' has never, ever stopped opportunistic predators from abusing people with less power than them.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"50239585"},"id_str":"50239585","name":"Clementine Ford 🧟‍♀️","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"127816"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3133"},"created_at":"Wed Jun 24 07:01:48 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"101258"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"9"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"76"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"925"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"8"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"103"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.13578"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"1"}}

Thread. But first, here are some pictures of my presence within the Muslim community; in order that nobody claims that I “don’t represent anyone”. My pictures with government authorities are also widely available online. https://t.co/b6feLP3VKj Lauren spoke first, so I will begin by speaking about her presentation this evening. She began by identifying the problems our societies face, and how Western civilization has been governed by political groups that promote the theory of multiculturalism. She presented an extremely solid and powerful case, proving that multiculturalism is not a successful way of running a country or society. You cannot have different dominant cultures in your country, and still preserve and protect the original host culture. Her entire speech was full of facts, logical analysis, and great examples. Never once did she attack any minority groups or spread hatred. She presented herself professionally and academically. Stefan began his speech with a very powerful introduction. I had to excuse myself out of the venue during most of his speech, but I returned towards the end. His perspective this evening was exactly what Adelaide needed to hear. The applause he received shook the venue. During Q&amp;A, both Lauren and Stefan were articulate, informative, respectful, professional, and brought new insights from current research. Their presence drew the audience in and held their attention for nearly 3 hours. Tonight, I was honoured to open for both of them. More importantly, I am very grateful that they took the time out of their schedules and lives to address their fans in Australia. Lastly, left-wing Australian media owes both of them an apology. They portrayed both of them as evil troublemakers, when in reality their entire event was professional, educational and inspirational. The exact opposite of what the media had claimed.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1583865109"},"id_str":"1583865109","name":"Imam of Peace","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"460977"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"601"},"created_at":"Wed Jul 10 19:25:28 +0000 2013","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"8793"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"9"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"837"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"4641"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"93"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"516"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.49849"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

Since you both asked, here are some questions for your upcoming interviews with Andy McCabe. 1) You told @ScottPelley, \"I was fired because I opened an investigation into the president.\" You secretly opened the investigation in May 2017. Robert Muller took over that investigation about a week after you opened it, also in May 2017. You were fired in March 2018. The first public reporting that you had opened the investigation came via this @nytimes article in January of 2019 - https://t.co/kQhg82viYN - an article for which you seem to have been a primary source. At the time of your firing, nobody outside the FBI and DoJ knew that you had opened the Trump investigation. So, again - why were you fired from the FBI? 2) You told @ScottPelley one of your predicates for opening the investigation was Trump's insistence that DAG Rosenstein include \"Russia\" in the firing memo - you said you found that to be an \"articulable fact that indicated that a crime may have been committed.\" You made it sound as if Trump was asking Rosenstein to fire Comey because of \"Russia\" and to write that in the memo. You know as well as anyone that Trump wanted Rosenstein to note in the memo that Comey had told Trump on three occasions that he wasn't under investigation for... ...\"Russia\" - in fact, Trump attached a note to that effect on the memo. Why did you purposely mischaracterize Trump's desire to include \"Russia\" in the firing memo? Given the articulable fact that the reason Trump wanted \"Russia\" mentioned was to tell the country what Comey... ...had told him privately, what crime, exactly, did Trump possibly commit in this instance? 3) James Comey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2017 that he had never authorized anyone in the FBI to be an anonymous source of information leaked to the... ...media related to either the Trump or Clinton investigations. You told the IG that you consulted with Comey about the @WSJ leak that got you fired, and that he was okay with it. Your lawyer said you've got emails and phone records to prove it. Why did Comey lie under oath to... ...the Judiciary committee? That'll do for a start.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2897965392"},"id_str":"2897965392","name":"Jason Beale","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"10252"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1522"},"created_at":"Thu Nov 13 02:10:44 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"17390"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"9"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"895"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3288"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"99"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"365"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.95891"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

What happens likely depends on where they are in their mission, mission priority, tolerance for being publicly identified, etc. It also likely depends on how badly they think they're burned. https://t.co/q1FUMMfgny A victim identifying a phishing doc or phishing backdoor doesn't necessarily mean the op is blown. In fact, it may give the victim a false confidence if they found the initial infection but didn't follow lateral movement. Same if an attacker loses a couple of implants out of many However, trying to remove large numbers of implants and missing some, CURLing all of their C2 from your network, uploading several post-exploit backdoor samples to VT, discussing the intrusion in email, etc. - those are things that are more likely to elicit a response. If the attacker wants to maintain access, they'll likely change toolsets and infrastructure. This may mean a new backdoor family or they may move to web shells, tunnelers, using legit creds for VPN/Citrix/cloud services, etc. They may leave their burned tooling or remove it. The attacker may also go for spray and pray - deploying so much malware that the victim can't keep up, thus buying time to complete the mission. This may require more labor, but doesn't require much depth of tooling. This is a good tactic for smash and grab operations. The attacker may do both, as in the incident we discussed in #noeasybreach - deploying new and stealthy malware while also mass-deploying known backdoors. Of course, the attacker may pack up and leave, if they have already completed their mission, or if they are very sensitive to being identified or averse to exposing TTPs. Never assume this is the case until you've run down every lead. In addition to maintaining OPSEC, it is also important to fully scope an incident before attempting remediation. Once an attacker has had time to move laterally, it is too late to play whack-a-mole. Remove attacker access, reset passwords, and address infection vector in one move See this thread from @cglyer for more remediation thoughts and examples of stalling attackers without tipping your hand. https://t.co/sTSMO1Za3W","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1164836580"},"id_str":"1164836580","name":"Matthew Dunwoody","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"6328"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"277"},"created_at":"Sun Feb 10 03:53:06 +0000 2013","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"2557"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"9"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"61"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"194"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"7"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"22"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.10374"},"all_hashtags":["noeasybreach"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Then not guilty verdict is considered an appropriate form of protest against presidents policies. Its like taking a knee on someones grave. 6. Justice Perverted is justice denied.

It's clear that Corbyn's era is coming to a close. It may still take a couple of years but he and his racist cult have blown it. The Party's membership numbers are collapsing. Many of those who remain are voting for other parties. There's probably a core group of 250k who will stick with their \"Jessiah\" either because of, or despite, his antisemitism. They will ensure that @UKLabour will die. Those many millions of decent left leaning voters will build something new, either through an existing party eg Lib Dems or by creating something else. They know that something is rotten within Corbyn's Labour and they understandably don't want to be associated with it. The cult is becoming more and more extreme and unbalanced. Maybe they too know it's all over? In the future, books will be written about them. Fingers will point at the new left media who were those primarily responsible for the scapegoating of, and lying about, Jews. The \"othering\" of Jews by @TheCanaryUK and @TheMendozaWoman and Aaron \"I wrote a PhD about myself' Bastani and the teenage, racist scribblers at @novaramedia will have chapters written about them.

In 2013, former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt was convicted by a tribunal in his own country of genocide and crimes against humanity: https://t.co/r9LK5XbQA3 3/ These crimes against humanity occurred when the United States was giving Rios Montt its full support to fight against leftist guerrillas in 1982 and 1983. 4/ Per WaPo: \"A United Nations-sponsored truth commission found that nearly half of all the human rights violations during the conflict occurred in 1982, a year when Gen. Rios Montt was de facto ruler of Guatemala... More than 200,000 Guatemalans perished during the civil war.\" 5/ Instrumental in paving the way for US funding to Rios Montt was none other than, you guessed it, Elliott Abrams! He played a key role in whitewashing the utterly brutal tactics that Rios Montt used during the war 6/ Per the NYT, Abrams in 1983 justified US backing of Rios Montt on the grounds that he had \"brought considerable progress\" to Guatemala when it came to human rights. https://t.co/AJIDf74h4Z 7/ Abrams also tsk-tsked concerns about Rios Montt's slaughter of civilians by saying, \"the amount of killing of innocent civilians is being reduced step by step,\" while further adding that \"we think that kind of progress needs to be rewarded and encouraged.\" 8/ And this, frankly, is why everyone who has a basic understanding of history should not believe for a single second that the Trump administration appointed Abrams to bring freedom and democracy to Venezuela. That's not what he does -- it's not what he's ever done. 9/ And very good of @IlhanMN for reminding people of this.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"18478178"},"id_str":"18478178","name":"Gravel Teens Fanboy","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"2082"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"732"},"created_at":"Tue Dec 30 14:42:46 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"39011"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"9"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"8411"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"28559"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"935"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3173"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.85863"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

Muslims believe God is a reality. i would like to start with the known scientific fact, that the universe had a beginning. For this i think there are only 4 possibilities: 1. Universe came from nothing, 2. Universe created itself 3. It was created by something else that was created. 4. It was created by something that is uncreated. I think these are good possibilities we could discuss. 1. What is nothing?, I would define nothing here as general term nothing we know as nothing, where there is no material or matter. You know and i know that nothing, with infinite time, will still lead to nothing, unless there is something. It will be impossible. 2. Can the universe create itself? This is absurd as well, as this means it exist and not exist at the same time. We can't accept this argument as well. 3. Can the universe give rise from something already created?, can we have X number of universes?. This is the infinite regress of causes, which means an initial universe could not exist and because an infinite, does not have a beginning, there can never be a beginning. This is also not possible rationally. 4. Although it is short, we have arrived at last point, which is the universe began to exist Because it was caused to come to existence by God, who is eternal, uncreated, and ever -living being. Hence accepting the causality is what science teaches us. This is quite self-evident deductive logic. It does not require an inductive experimental proof, because the God is not within his creation, but he is external to its creation.

What we found has left me devastated. https://t.co/SL7IRsCWPu https://t.co/76xQ0jfrn6 Children should spend no more than a few hours in short-term border jails and US-law limits their detention under typical circumstances to 72 hours, but many of the children we interviewed at Clint had been there for three or four weeks. The Border Patrol claims that high numbers of border arrivals are causing these delays as they wait for space to open up in the somewhat more child-friendly detention centers and shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement at US Health and Human Services. Based on our interviews, officials seem to be making no effort to release children to caregivers – and many have parents in the US – rather than holding them for weeks in overcrowded cells sometimes sleeping on hard floors. Nearly all of the children I spoke with had been held without any communication from desperate parents. Meanwhile, a public health emergency is brewing. While we were denied access to speak with children quarantined in special cells for those with flu, several infants held in South Texas facilities were admitted recently to a hospital, after the intervention of doctors and lawyers. Children at Clint told us they don’t have regular access to showers or clean clothes, with some saying they hadn’t been allowed to bathe over periods of weeks and don’t have regular access to soap. The US government argued in court on Tuesday that its obligation to provide “safe and sanitary” conditions does not require it to provide kids with hygiene items such as soap or toothbrushes. https://t.co/YPYELuWMRI Many of the kids in the Clint facility are too young to wash or feed themselves, yet they are left to fend for themselves with the help of unrelated older children. Congress should urgently investigate and take action to stop these unconscionable abuses, such as requiring immigration agencies to release these children as soon as possible to their family members.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"105326014"},"id_str":"105326014","name":"Clara Long","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"4993"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1555"},"created_at":"Sat Jan 16 01:30:08 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"2937"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"10"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2736"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3665"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"274"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"366"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.88226"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

Allow me to explain. https://t.co/F1cZQmVda3 Since people like to bring up following the law, they should probably know what it is, and what it isn't. The federal misdemeanor, § 1325, is improper entry. It's a misdemeanor, not a felony. The law is written as improper (not illegal) entry. If you're convicted under § 1325 and return without authorization you may then be charged under federal felony, § 1326, for re-entry. That's it. Those are the only two immigration crimes in the United States of America. As far as I know, no child has ever been tried under § 1325 (or therefore under § 1326). So to write, as so many reporters surprisingly do, that a child entered \"illegally\" is ignorant. But what about adults who stand accused of breaking the law? Well, when reporters write about people who're charged, we always use words like alleged or suspected. Even when there's video and other clear evidence, it's always alleged until the person in question is found guilty*. *except with it comes to brown people crossing the border. There's an unstated exception, to the point where it's now standard, to use a presumed crime to write that someone is \"illegal,\" it that they crossed \"illegally.\" It's plainly wrong and it's unethical. It's especially troubling because a lot of the people that you read about who are described as having \"crossed illegally\" haven't even been charged. There isn't even a legal allegation of a crime yet the writing already suggests a conviction. When it comes to ICE operations (the pending ones aren't exactly raids, but I'll save that for another day), we're talking about people who have never even been charged with a crime. That's because most immigration law in the United States of civil. Not criminal. The family members that are reportedly being targeted for removal? My guess is somewhere between 99-100% have never been charged with the federal misdemeanor of improper entry. That's why ICE technically \"detains\" instead of \"arrests.\" Because we're talking about a civil issue. In fact, some of those family members entered *with* authorization. But the civil law that applied to them may have altered their authorization. Like most things, it's complicated. And using the term \"illegal\" to apply to an entire class of people is not a good thing. Do better.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"15407632"},"id_str":"15407632","name":"Aura Bogado","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"63297"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"959"},"created_at":"Sat Jul 12 20:28:33 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"41575"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"10"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"13477"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"51966"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1348"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5197"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.20569"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Disgust","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

The military would not comment on its reasoning, but the move could be related to the upcoming memoir of Ehud Olmert, who ordered the strike and has hinted about it for years. 4-The message from the 2007 attack on the reactor is that Israel will not tolerate construction that can pose an existential threat,\" military chief Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot said. \"This was the message in 1981, this is the message in 2007 &amp; this is the future message to our enemie” 5-The military said the F-15s took off from two bases in southern Israel at 10:30 p.m. on September 5 and returned four hours later. Wednesday's announcement also indicated the Syrian reactor was much closer to completion than previously reported. 6-Air force commander Amikam Norkin said the current turmoil in Syria has further vindicated the strike, particularly since the reactor was in an area later captured by ISIS. “Imagine what situation we would be in today if there was a nuclear reactor in Syria,\" Norkin said Uzi Rabi of Moshe Dayan Centre: The move to go public about the attack was \"aimed at Iranian eyes or Iranian ears”. Basically, what Iran is doing in Syria is broadening up its military infrastructure. 8-Uzi Rabi: “I think that Israel, having realised that Iran is fastly approaching the red line, is trying to publicise what should be published in order to give Iran kind of a warning sign.\" 9-Israeli military: We began obtaining information regarding foreign experts helping Syria develop the Deir el-Zour site in late 2004. Later , we discovered that North Korea was helping Syria build a reactor to manufacture plutonium. 10-Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 until 2009 and was recently released from prison after serving time for corruption, is expected to delve more deeply into the issue in his upcoming book, which may have spurred the military into coming clean about the mission.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2953623765"},"id_str":"2953623765","name":"EHSANI2","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"9909"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1941"},"created_at":"Wed Dec 31 19:54:33 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"20342"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"10"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"38"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"54"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.93187"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

They say obstruction of justice requires an underlying crime. In fact, obstruction of justice does not require the prosecution of an underlying crime, and there is a logical reason for that. Prosecutors might not charge a crime precisely *because* obstruction of justice denied them timely access to evidence that could lead to a prosecution. If an underlying crime were required, then prosecutors could charge obstruction of justice only if it were unsuccessful in completely obstructing the investigation. This would make no sense. 3.

In fact, the president could not have known whether every single person Mueller investigated did or did not commit any crimes. 4.

Brown at the Miami Herald @jkbjournalist is the one who broke this open. Her story is the best one you'll see today summing up what has happened: https://t.co/dx1lAyBW6y For the Epstein case itself, this is a breakthrough because for the first time, a court is confirming Epstein's serial abuse of multiple minor girls (a federal crime) in Florida, elsewhere in the US, and abroad. That had not been established in court before in part because Acosta, as US Attorney, gave Epstein a non-prosecution agreement for all fed crimes - a deal that extended to all his potential accomplices. Acosta instead let Epstein plead on *prostitution* charges in state court. (State prostitution charges, really? If you're a grown-ass man doing this to children, is it really the most important thing under the law to know whether or not you also gave the kids money?? Arrrrgh.) Forgive the aside. The basis for the civil case that led to today's ruling was the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which should have *blocked* Acosta from doing this deal in secret with Epstein, without telling his potential victims. Here, Julie Brown sums it up elegantly: https://t.co/sNCoACvYIk Today, as Brown sums it up, the judge ruled that, \"while prosecutors had the right to resolve the case in any way they saw fit, they violated the law by hiding the agreement from Epstein’s victims.\" And which prosecutors did that specifically? Was it someone just working below Alex Acosta that he might not have known about? Someone he just didn't adequately supervise on this case? Uh, not according to the judge. Read this: https://t.co/OBxcztevut So, a federal judge just ruled that the current Labor Secretary gave a secret non-prosecution agreement to a prolific, serial child sex offender -- then broke the law by agreeing with the guy's defense team that they'd all keep it secret from the victims.

I was really close to my dad so I visited his grave a lot. I still do. [DON’T WORRY, IT GETS FUNNIER.] I always took flowers and my mum visited a lot and she always took flowers and my grandparents were still alive then and they always took flowers. My dad’s grave frequently resembled a solid third place at the Chelsea Flower Show. Nice but I felt bad for the guy buried next to my dad. He NEVER had flowers. Died on Christmas Day aged 37, no one left him flowers and now there’s a pop-up florist in the grave next door. So I started buying him flowers. I STARTED BUYING FLOWERS FOR A DECEASED MAN I’D NEVER MET. I did this for quite some time, but I never mentioned it to anyone. It was a little private joke with myself, I was making the world a better place one bunch of flowers at a time. I know it sounds weird but I came to think of him as a friend. I wondered if there was a hidden connection between us, something secretly drawing me to him. Maybe we went to the same school, played for the same football club or whatever. So I googled his name, and ten seconds later I found him. His wife didn’t leave him flowers BECAUSE HE’D MURDERED HER. ON CHRISTMAS DAY. After he murdered his wife, he murdered her parents too. And after that he jumped in front of the only train going through Balcombe tunnel that Christmas night. THAT was why no one ever left him flowers. No one except me, of course. I left him flowers. I left him flowers every couple of weeks. Every couple of weeks FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS. I felt terrible for his wife and her parents. Now, I wasn’t going to leave them flowers every couple of weeks for two and a half years but I did feel like I owed them some sort of apology. I found out where they were buried, bought flowers and drove to the cemetery. As I was standing at their graves mumbling apologies, a woman appeared behind me. She wanted to know who I was and why I was leaving flowers for her aunt and grandparents. AWKWARD. I explained and she said ok that’s weird but quite sweet.

Here’s the document: https://t.co/LcZLH8CYFQ … He's trying to depose Trump. Here's an explainer. First, the background: #StormyDaniels 1/ Oct. 2016: #MichaelCohen worked with Stormy’s lawyer #KeithDavidson to arrange for Stormy to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) [What’s that? See this thread: https://t.co/uPZPG4ztTu ] Jan 2018: someone leaked the agreement to the WSJ. Stormy said it wasn't her. 2/ Cohen, using “intimidation and coercive tactics, forced [Stormy] to sign a false statement” denying she had an affair with Trump. [Quotations are from her complaint, here: https://t.co/9DgWR7giPN ] Cohen then issued a public statement about the hush agreement, prompting. . . 3/ . . Trump supporters to unleash a torrent of “ridicule and threats” against Stormy—but she couldn’t defend herself because of the NDA. So Stormy hired Avenatti and sued to be released from her NDA. Cohen (stupidly) moved the case to federal court. 4/This gave giving the chance to amend her complaint, so she did: She sued Cohen for defamation. Trump then called Stormy a liar. So she sued Trump for defamation as well. Last month, Cohen won a victory: he told the court he'd be pleading the 5th in his criminal SDNY case . . . 5/. . .and because of the overlap between the cases, Stormy's case had to be put on hold, or he'd be forced to incriminate himself in Stormy's case in violation of his 5th Amend. rights. He got a 3 month stay. But Trump and his \"lawyer\" Giuliani continued making press statements. 6/They made statements like \"the 130K payment was perfectly legal\" and statements about how Trump reimbursed Cohen. (Oops. Trump wasn't supposed to know about any of it.) So Avenatti's new motion argues that because Trump (obviously) knows everything, as per these statements... 7/ Avenatti can depose Trump instead of Cohen, and no need to keep the case on hold. [Twitter Law 101: A deposition is when a party or witness to a lawsuit answers questions under oath as part of the pre-trial evidence-gathering process.] If the judge grants Avenatti's motion, 8/. . . Avenatti would get to depose Trump. Pause for a moment to imagine Avenatti deposing Trump ! ! ! Now we wait to see how the judge rules on Avenatti's motion. Avenatti's motion shows the problem with Trump's \"flood the zone\" strategy: It's backfiring in the Stormy case. 9/ What do I mean by the \"flood the zone\" strategy?

They got lucky when fate was handing out brains, became doctors, and were cherry-picked as 1970s migrants to fill a skill-shortage in NZ. Some genuine thoughts on ‘the Kiwi way’ from the outside: 1/ It’s a cliché of self-criticism to point out the ‘she’ll be right’ attitude that pervades ‘Kiwi’ society. But it deserves analysis as an attitude that is born out of a small, close-knit and high-trust country. 2/ ‘The Kiwi way’ is to set things up in a kind of half-assed way, or to plan things fairly poorly or not at all, because here, working assumptions are that people are good, and that the community will help us muddle through when we realised that we fucked it up. 3/ That’s why we think ‘the Kiwi way’ is egalitarianism, even as we’ve let our country slide into the highest inequality metrics in the OECD. 4/ That’s why we think ‘the Kiwi way’ is clean and green simply because of the high land:population ratio and our love of the outdoors, even though the environment is so badly managed that there’s too much poo in our waterways to swim in them. 5/ That’s why we think ‘the Kiwi way’ is to be super practical at coping with hardly any resources or infrastructure (No.8 wire!), because our planning is so bad that, for example, our biggest city has no subway and Piha has no plumbing. 6/ That’s why we think ‘the Kiwi way’ is to have a lack of corruption, but possibly less because our institutions &amp; laws are particularly good at preventing it, than the fact that the country is small enough that people will remember your face when you fuck over too many of them. 7/ Dad was a classic boomer landlord, but would periodically shout from his armchair at the paper (being a newspaper-reading boomer), “we need a capital gains tax, you idiots!” (alternately, “we need a capital gains tax, you cowards!”) 8/ He was the kind of guy to have dying tax policy wishes, and his dying tax policy wish was for a fucking CGT. But he thought ‘the Kiwi Way’ of leaving things up to goodwill and half-assing it all the way, meant that it would never happen. 9/ Go on, prove the immigrant wrong, you cowards.

Judge: “Miss Parker where was Mr. Barrow on the afternoon of April 13?” Bonnie: “He was at church with me, Judge.” 3/Judge: “Mr. Barrow can you vouch for her whereabouts?” Clyde: “Yes, Judge, she was with me.” 4/Let’s diagram it. If a machine has not been compromise then a paper printout of the stored choices will reconcile to vote totals that are transmitted to tabulating computers. 5/If on the other hand a machine has been compromised to transmit incorrect choices and print those incorrect choices on a paper printout, the totals will still reconcile. 6/ So...reconciling to a paper printout of stored choices tells you nothing at all about whether the machine has been compromised. 7/If on the other hand, you maintain the physical marked ballot and reconcile in a post election audit tabulated totals to physical ballots, then it doesn’t matter what the printout says because the best evidence of voter choice is the ballot that was marked. 8/ But that is not what GA does.

I couldn't. There weren't Americans in charge. 1/ For reporters on the ground in Baghdad, it was hilarious, maddening and a bit terrifying that people in the U.S. actually thought the occupation of Iraq was going well. We knew. We saw with our eyes: the looting, the chaos, the complete lack of plan among the Americans. 2/ Much later--in June when I came back to NY on vacation--even some of my lefty friends didn't believe me and Jen that the occupation was a complete disaster. It was still in the pundits-yelling-at-each-other phase on TV. 3/ That was a moment where I didn't feel like I was predicting the future. I was merely stating the clear, observable truth. I felt the same in late 2007, after I spent a few weeks studying C.D.O.s, those toxic assets at the heart of the financial crisis. 4/ Once I knew how they worked, I knew there was a massive financial crisis underway. (I was late to it, others figured this out long, long before me.) But it took another nine or ten months for the entire world to see it. By then, of course, it was too late. 5/ There are many reporters who, now, know a lot about Donald Trump and his ties to shady oligarchs around the former Soviet Union. We know that Michael Cohen was central to those relationships. 6/ It feels, to me, that we are in the same place we were around the time of that Mission Accomplished sign or the quiet before Bear Stearns and Lehman. This isn't about opinions anymore. Every single person who has looked at the business knows in a simple, clear way. 7/ In fact, this one is a lot simpler and clearer than the Iraq occupation or the financial crisis. The Trump Org made much money through shady deals with corrupt criminals. Most of it will come out. It will be uglier and, somehow, also more pathetic than most realize. 8/ Remember Bush and the Iraq war were polling at 70% on the day of that Mission Accomplished move. It was still common for pundits--like Kudlow--to say there was no crisis in January, 2008, when the fire was burning all around us. 9/ This is no time to be complacent, of course.

Stop serving ideas, people, and desires that require less of you than you could be. You are made less for this, and your life grows smaller because of it 2. Do not allow hypocrisy between your actions and your beliefs. They are either in alignment, or they are not. You are a hypocrite, or you are truthful 3. Do what makes you strong. If what you do, follow, believe makes you fragile, you are weak, and you will suffer the consequences of your weakness 4. Be in relationships that serve. Both yourself, and the other person. Relationships that are one sided are either exploitive or enslaving. Make yours honorable 5. Get your environment in order. What surrounds is always affecting you and creating you. Take control of this, do not be reactive to it. 6. Do what is brave, and not what is fearful. Your intuition will always guide you very clearly on this. 7. You are responsible for your actions, the consequences of your actions, and the consequences of the consequences. Be conscientious of this phenomena. Everything you do will matter, and in ways you cannot imagine 8. Knowledge is powerful and real only if applied. Application is the proving ground for the accuracy of belief and what you believe you know. Applied knowledge is what you should always be cultivating 9. Everything that you are is your fault.

Very often, white women have used white supremacist tactics to stomp out black and poc voices. White women’s tears have legit gotten black people killed I’ll be linking a few articles in thus thread. Watching the tactics and language Milano has used the past 48hrs shows how dangerous some white women can be when they don’t listen to black and brown women. https://t.co/dFGRsFtihk Many black, brown and other poc women scholars have written about the gaslighting and white supremacist tatics that are used to co-opt and silence us. There are whole syllabus and uni courses dedicated to it. Here’s another article. https://t.co/mlWionUnyF If your feminism isn’t intersectional, then you’re doing activism wrong. If you can’t handle honest critique, get out of activism, we’re not here to feed your ego. Lives are on the line. What is intersectionality? Welp, Scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term “intersectionality” in her insightful 1989 essay, “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics.” More here on Crenshaw’s work. https://t.co/hx4IC81oWy Here’s the thing, because this can turn into a damn research analysis and I’m not going to do that on twitter dot com. White women like Milano and McCain are equally dangerous for different reasons. One is more vocal and vicious while the other is gentile. Both are deadly. I’m not going to tag Anoa out of respect. Watching how Alyssa has attempted to gaslight an Atl activist is a study that’s been commenly used. It’s maddening and counterproductive to activism. Honey, your white women tear tactics need to be called out and stopped. It’s 2019 and we’re sick of your shit. https://t.co/q3Xk8LX8VM In conclusion, because I gotta end this thread, if black and brown women try to correct your bad activism please take head. There are people on the ground working. Listen to them, don’t co-opt and try to lead a movement. Figure out how you can help and learn constructively.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"248023936"},"id_str":"248023936","name":"AshleyStevens","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"7648"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1155"},"created_at":"Sun Feb 06 02:51:49 +0000 2011","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"58715"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"11"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1609"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"8393"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"146"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"763"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.95586"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Anger","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

Furthermore they created the ambiguous narrative that the SM and CU that came with the membership, together with FoM, could be replaced by an FTA between the UK and EU. 2 This would have eliminated the requirement for FoM. This promise was based on a fundamental ambiguity. That Free Trade is the same as Frictionless trade. 3 What we understood now is that this is simply not true. Free Trade is about tariffs, frictionless trade is another thing altogether. It allows the creation of integrated supply chains in the automotive industry. 4 It enables the trade of highly perishable goods for pharma and food industries. It reduces the need for and costs of warehouses for stocking components. It reduces the costs of customs posts and checks. It reduces the cost of checks for incoming goods. 5 The Remain campaign failed to explain this crucial difference. The only place in the world which has frictionless trade is the EU. Any other trading block linked by FTAs lacks frictionless trade. E.g. US and Canada. 6 This is because frictionless trade is the result of eliminatining internal borders. The miracle that the EU created was to allow frictionless trade, which was once possible only WITHIN the borders of a single national entity, into something possible BETWEEN nations. 7 The instruments to achieve this are both the CU and the SM. Only by combining the abolition of tariffs (CU) with agreed regulation of product standards (SM), frictionless trade can be achieved even between bordering nations. FoM simply follows from that. 8 This is why there is still a problem in the Brexit camp at understanding the economic red lines. The EU cannot accept a third country to enjoy frictionless trade while outside the CU and SM. But are perfectly happy to have an FTA that drops all tariffs. 9 What HMG has recently realized, is that what would cause immense damage to the economy, is nothing to do with trade per se, but such trade ceasing to be frictionless. The public instead is still uninformed of the fact that no FTA can ever achieve frictionless trade. 10 Therefore when talking to Leavers please explain: THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TARIFF FREE AND FRICTIONLESS TRADE. TARIFF FREE WE CAN ACHIEVE OUTSIDE THE EU, BUT A LARGE PART OF UK BUSINESS DEPENDS OF FRICTIONLESS TRADE, WHICH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED OUTSIDE OF THE EU. 11","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2869446232"},"id_str":"2869446232","name":"🌹Max 🇪🇺🇬🇧🇮🇹#revokeA50 #FPBE","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"5213"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"4808"},"created_at":"Sun Nov 09 19:12:57 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"13635"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"11"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"213"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"395"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"19"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"36"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.79392"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

I vividly remember reading it in high school as my own-choice independent novel which I was then required to write an essay about. What is coming back to me quite clearly as I watch the show adaptation is how frustratingly real and fallible I found both characters. I feel that they’ve captured that quality of their dynamic at this early part of their relationship quite well. They’ve never lived together. They’ve barely shared space for more than a week or two at a time. They lived on different continents! Roger hasn’t yet learned that Brianna pushes away when she really wants people to stay in an argument (to his credit he DOES learn this). Furthermore, Bree is a terrible communicator who hasn’t yet learned that Roger will always follow through on his word and commitments. (She grew up an only child remember, with two parents who actively didn’t communicate about certain things as role models.) Navigating these minefields of communication is part of why the novels are so great: You can read each characters inner monologue and understand their point of view even if it makes you all “GAAAHH!!!” https://t.co/q3cEKWOOn4 The ongoing difficulty of adapting these novels for tv is that inner monologues—by necessity of medium—have to become dialogue, Outer Monologue, or visible. And there’s only so much of that which can be communicated in 1.25 hours. Given these strictures, I’m so impressed by @RikRankin @SkeltonSophie the writing &amp; directing teams &amp; the crew for how they’ve distilled these fraught and psychologically dense developments for the screen. I didn’t come to love them as a couple in the books until well into Breath of Snow and Ashes. They had some growing up and learning to do before they could truly function well as a couple. That’s Real. It’s hard to watch because we always want to skip to the happily-ever-after Knowing how things turn out makes it easy to second guess their reactions and choices. But they’re BOTH operating under mid-20th century expectations of personal privilege in 18th-century conditions. Those expectations fail them both spectacularly. My understanding is that a component of how Herself writes is to explore the ramifications of events and choice upon each character through their own lense. Throw something at them and engage with how they respond. How Roger and Bree respond to this pivotal 24hr period in their lives shapes literally everything after. How they got there isn’t actually the point, what they do next IS. /fin","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"203246950"},"id_str":"203246950","name":"Jen Lei *still abiding in Westeros*","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"289"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"723"},"created_at":"Fri Oct 15 21:23:23 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"11346"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"11"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"57"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1510"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"4"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"5"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"137"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.63797"},"all_hashtags":["IHaveSomeThoughts","Outlander","RogerAndBree","DrumsofAutumn"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

They walked around before they asked me and few others to step outside and took my documents and interrogated me for around 20 mins then claimed my papers were fake and that I’m “illegal”. I explained to them that I was granted Asylum here in the United States, and that the work permit they currently hold and the license are impossible to get unless your presence here is legal. They told me that I was lying and these could pretty much be falsified. They got on the phone with immigration and gave them my name and document number and I can hear the person on the end of the line saying that yes they can see my name and yes, I entered the country legally. The ICE agent ended the call and then said “there are no records of your Asylum” and I again said that was impossible. Then said I should had my Asylum approval on me which is ridiculous, why would I carry that where I have my IDs. I kept it together and told them that what they are doing now is illegal and that they must hand me my documents back or I will have to call my lawyer and take legal action. Another ICE agent then started yelling at me to take my hands out of my pockets and I did which is stupid because it was snowing and they were wearing gloves and my hands were freezing cold. They handed my documents back and said “next time, have your papers on you” which means nothing because I did and they said they were fake. To be honest, I have never felt as terrible as I did today. I have never imagined that I would have to go through this. It was an another reminder that even though I have been here for 5 years working my ass off, I was still considered “Other” and I have never felt as alone as I did in that station full of people. The ironic part is that I though that smell on the Greyhound bus was gonna be the worst part of the trip. Also, fuck you @GreyhoundBus. You could have easily not let those agents on the bus but you’re just as shitty as you smell.

We came to America poor and penniless. Didn’t know the language &amp; had no connections. We came because capitalism provided opportunity while socialism provided oppression 2) My father worked as a laborer until he died as penniless as when he came. The opportunity he sought wasn’t necessarily for himself, it was for his children. We were taught to work hard, that there was honor in performing well and that crime led to death or worse, dishonor 3)After Carter destroyed the economy, my father lost his job, we were already poor, but after that, we were destitute and desperate. My father took any odd job to earn little cash. I did the same. For years we lived off of what our garden and our backs produced, in a violent city 4) We were surrounded by drugs and violence. The opportunity to do evil was abundant, but I said no. Every day was literally a struggle for survival. Gunfire erupted every night. Robberies were common. I avoided being shot thru sheer luck, maybe that could be called privilege 5) We lived in fear of losing our house or our lives until I was able to complete my education and help my family overcome their circumstances. Thru my college years I worked hard and studied harder. I knew the price of failure and it wasn’t an option. 6) At any time I could’ve chosen crime. Some of my friends did, some died, some went to jail. We all have a choice. Thru never ending toil I completed my education and my training. I was driven, not to just survive, but to thrive. In my profession, I’m one of the best... 7) ... not because of my race but what I was able to produce. Nothing was ever given to me. Everything I got in this life was because of the sweat of my brow, the breaking of my back or my intelligence, never because of my race. 8)The only privilege I ever received is the same as every American, being a citizen of the greatest nation on Earth. Opportunity is equal, outcome is up to you, no matter your race. So, I mean this with utmost sincerity, fuck Kyle Korver and every motherfucker that assumes I’m... 9)... I was granted an easy road because of my skin color. If fucking Kyle found his life easy, it was probably because someone else sacrificed for his ungrateful ass and he’s too stupid to understand the pain that others endured so he didn’t have to. 10) If I was to assume any stereotype based on race, that would make me a racist. Assuming I’m privileged because of my skin color makes you a racist. But before you assume my life was privileged, try walking in my shoes first, then tell me, otherwise, GFYs.

It sounded like the driver was pumping the gas for several minutes followed by terrible, high-pitched grinding and, finally, merciful silence as they drove off. Every morning. And it annoyed the hell out of me every morning. Who does this person think they are? Who does that? And one morning, after a month of this, in the midst of again being woken up, I got really annoyed, threw on my bathrobe, and marched out to the back of my apartment building ready to give this person a talking-to on being considerate to neighbors. I got back there and came across the sorriest looking vehicle I've seen in a long while, and this older gentleman standing next to it, concentrated on starting it. He looks up at me in my bathrobe and disheveled hair with the most apologetic--dare I say, humiliated-- expression. And I immediately felt terrible for being angry. This gentleman was on his way to work somewhere--same godawful, shitty time every morning--and it was just obvious he felt so embarrassed about the racket his shitty car was making. And he said with deep empathy: \"I'm sorry. I hope I didn't wake you.\" I lied. Because of course I did. And he knew I was lying. \"No, not at all. I was just coming back here to see if someone might need help getting their car started. You never know.\" Ugh, weak response. He flashed this sad smile and said he was fine and sorry again for the noise. I introduced myself + shook his hand, nonchalant, as though my daily habit were walking outside my apartment in my bathrobe at 6am, and he just happened to be on my route this particular morning. I've thought a lot about this interaction in the past few months, and whenever I get angry--and there's quite a number of reasons to inspire such a feeling in our current political environment--I think of this lovely human being struggling with a clunker to get to work... ...and how very easy it was for my anger to evaporate instantly once I understood what was happening and how easy it is to not be an asshole that assumes the worst over a mild inconvenience. This morning, again at 6am, same noises, and as with every morning since our interaction, no anger. No annoyance. Just peaceful acceptance. I'm off today from a job I really love, and he clearly has to go to his after the same damn start-up routine. I almost wanna hug him. Everyone's fighting battles.

So I won't be silent: https://t.co/FA79R4sWgT 1. Language's ability to inflict harm depends on power of who's wielding it &amp; against whom it's being wielded. Not just individuals, ie, it's not about Bee/Ivanka or Roseanne/Jarrett, all of whom have power. It's about power of entities &amp; ideas individuals are representing. 2. So when Bee goes after Ivanka for supporting an administration that's doing grievous harm to the bodies, families, lives of human beings, she's acting on behalf of less powerful people (immigrants ripped from their children) against the grotesquely powerful &amp; abusive. 3. You can not like the word \"cunt\" for feminist reasons; you can--&amp; should!--think about why a term for female anatomy is such a potent pejorative. But use of it in this context is not reinforcing or replicating the crude harm it has been used to inflict historically... 4. ie the patriarchal diminishment &amp; vilification of women. In fact, Bee is using it to critique a woman precisely because that woman is acting ON BEHALF OF THAT PATRIARCHY, one which systematically diminishes women, destroys families, hurts kids, especially non-white. 5. It is fundamentally different from Roseanne comparing Jarrett to an ape, a racist locution w deep racist roots, bc unlike Bee's deployment of cunt AGAINST a misogynistic, racist administration, Roseanne's racism is deployed IN SUPPORT OF a racist, misogynistic administration.. 6. that came to power in part on racist &amp; misogynistic rhetoric that vilified &amp; promised revenge against Obama administration of which Jarrett was a member &amp; which is using the power it so gained to inflict real world racist &amp; misogynistic harm on human beings. 7. Therefore, Roseanne's utterance mirrors &amp; reinforces harm being inflicted by most powerful against least powerful, while Bee's challenges that power dynamic 8. This also applies, of course, to faux-offense at Michelle Wolf, to cowering hobbits of the dark web &amp; to idea that metoo is a witch hunt and its critics have been unjustly silenced.

The constituent members of Mueller's special counsel are now the object of intense focus, and rightfully so: a plurality of them have contributed to Dem elections including that of Hillary and Obama. This is curious, bizarre and incongruent with logic. https://t.co/jcQ4WtUUmo 2. Muellers selection of this motley crew of Hillary elves toiling and texting away can be explained on a few levels of logic (presuming, I have logic). The first possibility is that this is pure chance, coincidence, happenstance. 3. However the probabilistic likelihood of having so many democratic leaning constituents all in an investigation designed to uncover Trumps collusion purely by chance is mathematically infinitesimal. 4. The other possibility is that Mueller is vehemently anti-Trump and wanted to make sure that nothing came between him and implicating Trump, not even actual facts, justice or doing the right thing. \"Guilty before the investigation\" dynamic. 5. Mueller is many things, stupid he is not. He knows exactly who is doing what and he knew exactly what each of them have done. The mathematical probability that they all landed in the same place for a specific reason is fairly high, but was it to implicate Trump? 6. I think they were put in a gremlin basket so that Mueller would feed them after midnight, revealing their truly heinous evil majesty. Remember the circle of filth?

The optics of this entire process would embolden the circle of filth. After all who can trust a guy who tweets random streams of consciousness like Trump does?

I'm gonna write a proper piece about this soon, but for now a quick thread on the direction of US conservative climate policy. I think over the next 10 years -- &amp; probably much sooner -- we'll see two distinct trends. 2. First, the US right will transition seamlessly from climate denialism to climate nationalism/fascism. They will acknowledge the threat &amp; use it to justify exploiting US fossil fuel reserves, building walls, shutting down immigration, &amp; passing punitive trade policies. 3. Collective action problems just don't sit well in the reactionary mind -- and non-zero-sum collective solutions are incomprehensible to it. However, a mad scramble of all-against-all, in which the powerful US can hoard &amp; intimidate &amp; come out ahead? That, reactionaries get. 4. Second, US conservatives will ramp up their demagoguery around \"eco-terrorism.\" As it becomes clear that the GOP simply won't allow a small-d democratic solution, desperate young people are going to turn to direct action. The GOP will use that to justify repression. 5. And be clear: as climate gets more &amp; more chaotic, and the ambient sense of threat &amp; uncertainty rises around the world, these kinds of reactionary responses will gain *more* public appeal, not less. Threat &amp; uncertainty make everyone more conservative. 6. So the US is at a crucial juncture, one that reflects a larger global dynamic: the space for addressing climate change in a cooperative, mutually beneficial way is rapidly shrinking. From here on out, circumstances will bolster the forces of reaction. 7. That's why the situation in Oregon is freaking me out. I thought we had at least a little time left in which the mechanisms of democracy could still work. But the fossil-funded white minority is openly, nakedly rejecting democracy &amp; it looks like they'll get away with it. 8. The right will see that it worked &amp; it will rapidly become standard practice, across states, maybe federally. (If you think the rules are different in different states, so it wouldn't work, you are still hung up on thinking rules matter.) 9. That would mean the end of any chance of the US addressing climate change through peaceful, mutually beneficial, democratic means. Oregon Ds elected majorities, then super-majorities ... now they're supposed to accept that success is only possible if they vote EVERY R out? 10. If democratic means become impossible, what's left is violence. There may be some radical climate activists who think they're ready for that, but guess what? The reactionaries will always have more guns &amp; fewer scruples. The forces of decency will never win that fight. 11. Basically, this is future-of-the-species stuff, getting decided through a spectacle that's barely even able to break into the daily news cycle. And the next time around, there may not even be the pretense of democracy. We are truly headed into the shit. &lt;/fin&gt;","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"22737278"},"id_str":"22737278","name":"David Roberts","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"129288"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2686"},"created_at":"Wed Mar 04 05:14:12 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"11241"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"11"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3557"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"13442"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"323"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1222"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.15404"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

While Trump was publicly running down how he would execute Putin's wish list if he were President (e.g. \"NATO is dead,\" \"We don't need sanctions,\" \"Let's move out of Syria) ... KUSHNER went to a pro-Russia think tank to get advice on Trump's foreign policy team. https://t.co/xVcE8AjUBU Why ON EARTH would Kushner go to Dimitri Simes for this?

After AOC won, she gave that rich guy a job in her office. Follow me on a journey. https://t.co/KSQqq3xKRY Last week, @AOC and her Chief of Staff @saikatc (the rich guy in question) freaked out on me when I pointed out it looked like she'd hired her boyfriend. I did some digging in the FEC. Turns out Saikat has \"hired\" her boyfriend, before...just not to do any actual work. .@AOC paid Brand New Congress LLC, which @saikatc owns, for strategic consulting. @BrandNew535, the PAC Saikat ran in parallel to his LLC, turned around and paid Riley Roberts - the boyfriend - the same amount as its sole \"marketing consultant\". How swampy. The payments to Roberts are the largest payments made by @BrandNew535 to any person or group other than Brand New Congress LLC. Oh, and Roberts doesn't work in marketing. https://t.co/XN8AYl0l7J Plus, the timing looks bad. .@BrandNew535 paid Riley Roberts $3,000 on August 9th, 2017. @AOC's campaign paid Brand New Congress LLC $6,191.32 on August 27th. A month later @BrandNew535 then paid Riley Roberts another $3,000. https://t.co/Oym09gLGZy Roberts lists his residence as Arizona, where he's from, for the purposes of the disbursement, but for the in-kind work in 2018 and his cash donations to @AOC's campaign, he lists New York. Looks like a sad attempt to be sneaky. https://t.co/lNAzmm4svP When @BrandNew535 decided to pay six grand to Roberts, AOC's campaign was $24,000 in the hole, having raised only about $3,000. By the end of 2017, she'd raised just over $8,000 but spent about $37,250. That's a lot of money on somebody's credit card. https://t.co/0vdioqSigu Now @saikatc says he left @BrandNew535 sometime in August of 2017. But @justicedems, which he continued running, and which remains on his profile, shared an address with @AOC's campaign. It appears he still owns Brand New Congress LLC. https://t.co/T0MS7ab80x .@saikatc funneling money to Roberts - who @AOC says is her spouse - is unethical and maybe illegal. And AOC didn't disclose this income, and didn't claim Roberts as a spouse, in her candidate financial disclosures. 2017: https://t.co/6ZgNoNWGmz 2018: https://t.co/wr1Dr1uAhP Now, maybe he wasn't her spouse then, but they were living together per her Vogue profile, so paying the money is still a massive ethical problem. https://t.co/SEqi5fEAe5 https://t.co/FRduzForEM So, we get an under the table PAC payments to your boyfriend from a wealthy benefactor, who you then hire?

As you can see, she’s trying to excuse herself. https://t.co/PPgIStLzIM 1/11 https://t.co/EXUVwOhJPa Why was this antisemitism, some of you may ask? Firstly as the IHRA definition of antisemitism states: “Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.”2/11 The second reason is historical, and it's exceptionally repulsive. There is an old antisemitic trope which took place at Easter called the “blood libel”. In 1144 a child, William of Norwich was murdered at Easter, without evidence the Christian community blamed the Jews. 3/11 This rumour spread like wildfire across Europe and it mutated into many other theories about Jews having to “murder children” to fulfill prophecies of returning to Israel, note the link to Israel.. it’s always there with antisemites - it means the “collective Jew” to them 4/11 Millions of Jews were killed throughout the ages based on this one falsehood. The last known person put on trial for this horrific untrue antisemitic trope was Menahem Mendel Beilis. His grandson is on twitter bravely fighting antisemitism just like his g/father @beilis_jay 5/11 So when Rachel Swindon tweets fake videos, at Easter, of Israel as the “collective Jew”. We know what she’s doing, and when @grahamemorris a @UKLabour MP RTs it - he knows what he is doing. 6/11 Finally Rachel Swindon is a prolific antisemite and “Jew Baiter” who consistently denies #LabourAntisemitism 7/11 Here is an example of Rachel Swindon's handiwork. Taunting @JewishLabour with the age old antisemitic trope that “Jews love money” 8/11 https://t.co/d5Bsx9eqsp Here she is again using Rothchilds tropes to mean Jews. Incidentally these are ALWAYS antisemitic, these tropes were promoted by the Nazis, who even made antisemitic propaganda films from them, for the masses. 9/11 https://t.co/sBqZXrB3nJ Rachel Swindon’s account has been sanctioned by twitter on many occasions for abusive behaviour, each time she is reinstated. Why? 10/11 https://t.co/V4U4SLKL7x So when you see decent @UKLabour voters supporting her or RTing her, remind them, that she’s the worst kind of antisemite, one who does it for attention and pay pal donations. 11/11 https://t.co/PPgIStLzIM","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"847051931738624000"},"id_str":"847051931738624000","name":"GnasherJew גנאשר","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"14492"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1233"},"created_at":"Wed Mar 29 11:44:52 +0000 2017","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"34864"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"11"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"222"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"487"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"20"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"44"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.01707"},"all_hashtags":["LabourAntisemitism"],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

The position that CNN was wrong to end Marc Lamont Hill’s contributorship over his anti-Semitism is perfectly legitimate and defensible—and is the position I tend to take on such controversies, very much including anti-Israel figures. But I disagree this time. I’ll explain why 2. There are two reasons. The first is the nature of the job. If MLH were, idk, an exec at a construction company or something, firing him over his views would be insane and cruel. But that’s not the case here—and indeed he’s not in danger of losing his day job. 3. CNN gig is the network bringing him on occasionally to opine on current affairs. His views on current affairs are riddled w/overt bigotry. I also thought Fox was right to banish its guest who made anti-Semitic comments about Soros. No reason to bring the guy back on air. None. 4. My views on Fox not bringing back on bigoted pundits are unremarkable. When the same principle is applied to CNN, it’s considered censorious—even though MLH has a far more prestigious and influential place in politics and culture than the Fox guy you don’t even remember. 5. And that, one suspects, is one reason for the hypocrisy: leftists think pawns can be taken off the board at will but please leave the bishop alone. That anti-Semites are considered so valuable to liberalism (the Forward defense of Sarsour et al) is a chilling admission. 6. The second reason is the nature of the comments. He did not call some Jewish guy greedy or scheming or whatever. No dog whistles. He used the single most famous genocidal anti-Israel call to arms in existence. To a room full of states who take such action! 7. And in the same speech, he told a room full of representatives of terror-supporting anti-Semitic states to *ignore calls for nonviolence regarding the Jewish state.* I think it’s kind of getting lost just how completely psychotic his speech actually was. 8. When he concluded with the famous genocidal slogan, the entire hall was electric with enthusiastic applause. It was like watching a between-the-wars Bavarian beer hall times a hundred. 9. But there’s a key difference: it wasn’t just a hall of angry people. It was a hall of representatives of countries around the world, at the headquarters of the world body, with that body’s imprimatur. Have you completely lost your goddamned minds? 10. Now again, you can defend his pundit job without defending his remarks. But the campaign to portray this as just a political disagreement is disingenuous in the extreme. If your position is there are no lines, fine. But if a line exists, MLH is on the wrong side of it. /fin Anyhoo that’s where I’m coming from. I cannot imagine defending MLH’s conduct—because it’s indefensible. But I absolutely *can* understand defending his paid CNN role to occasionally come on air and vomit nonsense. It is tv, after all.

THREAD: https://t.co/Nf5mw4vLNW 7 incarcerated men graduated from the Prison + Neighborhood Arts Project (@ArtsPrison) and Northeastern Illinois University's University Without Wall program. Keynote Speaker was Dr. Angela Y. Davis. Illinois Lt. Gov. Julianna Stratton gave remarks. Chance the Rapper performed. https://t.co/dPFIvkQ4Th Darrell Fair, one of the incarcerated graduates, was also tapped to speak. In his speech, Fair connected Reagan's '86 War on Drungs to Clinton's '94 Crime bill -- something that Dr. David would touch on later. https://t.co/5JadIiNcKW Fair said that these two acts not only fueled mass-incarceration but increasingly discarded education from prisons. Devon Terrell, another graduate, delivered a poem entitled \"For Youth's Sake\". In the poem, Terrell challenges complacency and insists people should take initiative in creating positive social change and being their best self \"for youth's sake\". He dedicated the poem to his son. https://t.co/p2wpnFIKu9 Lt. Gov. Julianna Stratton gave warm regards to the graduating class. She emphasized her belief in restorative and transformative justice. Stratton told the graduates that their lived experiences matter and that said experiences are needed to inform politicians as well as others. Dr. Angela Y. Davis lectured about how critical the political prisoner is to movements and knowledge producing. Dr. Davis gave examples of incarcerated activists expanding feminist and abolitionist frameworks. She didn't shy away from questioning the necessity of prisons too. Chance The Rapper performed to bleachers filled with men in their state blues. He performed the uplifting songs \"Blessings\" and the audience was with him every step of the way. Chance was visibly emotional as incarcerated men were standing singing along and not missing a beat. Imagine the organizing labor it took to get Julianna Stratton, Dr. Angela Y. Davis, and Chance The Rapper in the same room with an inaugural graduating class within a maximum security prison. That moment is the culmination in years of teaching, activism, and most of all...care. To support: Follow and Contact @ArtsPrison and @NEIU's University Without Walls.

Here's why: 3) * The Ds just did exactly what the GOP did to them in the 2013 shutdown - which exposes everyone on the left who was against the shutdown then (pols and their media pundits) as hypocrites. Those are EASY campaign adds to cut for the midterm push. 4) * The fact the Ds chose to die on the DACA hill when there was no need to do so, makes it VERY easy for the GOP to paint them as caring more about ILLEGAL immigrants without citizenship than ACTUAL AMERICANS WITH CITIZENSHIP (this talking point will bludgeon the left in '18). 5) * With the shutdown happening first, it sets the landscape perfectly to #releasethememo , which will bury the left in so much scandal they'll be too busy digging out of that collapsing house of cards to deal with the other two fronts they'll be assaulted on come midterms. 6) * #Releasethememo will (supposedly) bring an end to Mueller's probe, ending the Russian collusion story while also bringing down huge names on the left including (possibly) 44 himself... #ObamaGate 7) *Note, those are EVERY SINGLE talking point/campaign strategy the left was getting ready to use in the midterm push - and now they're nuetered: -Obama campaigning (tough to do now) -Russian Collusion (gone) -Mueller's never ending investigation (ended with 45 vindicated) 8) * This sets the stage for The STOTU in 10 days, and will provide 45 a chance to not only call out all of this (with names and evidence), but also allow him the chance to HEAL what will be a confused and angry nation with a unifying speech - motivating the midterm push. 9)*Add all those points up and you're looking at a bloodbath come midterms. The democratic party will be a smoldering pile of rubble, fractured and exposed. And the best part of all of this? The Ds did it all to themselves. Everything. Single. Thing... 10) From casting their lot with the USIC and the soft coup (oops), to picking a fight with the wrong man @GenFlynn (big OOPS), to the decision to push the Russian narrative in the MSM (boomerang coming back their way), to the decision to shutdown the government... 11) Have to tip the cap to team @realDonaldTrump .

This is what happened next https://t.co/syxVj23BNx The Shin Bet lady, who already knew everything about me and my family’s journey around the world, began with “You think because you’re a public person I can’t do whatever I want with you?” I was floored. This is how interrogations begin in police states. “Why do you hate Israel?” She asked. “I don’t hate Israel,” I replied. “But you hate our Prime Minister.” “I’m sorry is your Prime Minister Israel?” “He was democratically elected!” (No he wasn’t but let’s just drop that) “So was Trump and I hate him and still love America.” “Oh I know all about you and Trump,” she spat. I forgot the Israeli Right Wing’s affection for our racist Neo-Nazi loving president. “You don’t think Israel should exist yes?” That’s absurd. I’m against the occupation not Israel. Then the police state part began in earnest Write down names of Palestinians you know Write down names of journalists you associate with Write down names of Palestinian organizations you support And constantly, repeatedly, this threat: “if you don’t cooperate it will be a long time before you see your kids again.” I tried to cooperate the best I could. It was 104 degrees. My wife, my two 6yr olds, my 3yr old, and I my two elderly in-laws had been waiting for me in the sun for hours. But (again the police state tactic): every answer I gave she told me was lie. “Stop lying!” She’d yell. The questions got dumber and more surreal: “Who did your father work for in Iran?” I don’t know. I was 7 when we left “Oh Mr Scholar! You can tell me everything about the Ottoman Empire but you don’t know your own father’s history?” For the record I am not an Ottoman scholar. In the end, after hours of this, she warned “I may let you into Israel but, who knows, I may not let you out. I will keep you here and kick out your family. It depends on you. You would miss your kids yes?” That my friends is the classic police state trick. Iran has perfected it Her final warning was not to visit the Palestinian Territories. Not to meet with or speak to any Palestinians or any Israeli trouble makers. “We are watching you.” 2 days later I went to Bethlehem, to the wall, and took this picture: https://t.co/9RZyUjPVmo Two days after that, the Italian artist who painted this portrait of Ahed Tamimi was arrested and deported. This was my 4th trip to Israel in ten years and every time it’s gotten worse. It’s becoming unrecognizable as a democracy. It is becoming a full-blown police state. And it can’t last. When I was released my evangelical in-laws were in shock. “I had no idea it was like this,” they said. Now they do. So do more Americans each day. And if Israel loses them, who will continue to shield it from pressure to change course?

You store only changes (called events or experiences) to the model 4/ By storing only the changes, you can construct a model that fits real data if you want, but if it no longer works down the line, just throw it away and use the changes to build a new model that fits the data better 5/ This allows you to embrace and even be hungry for more data, more events, more change, because changes don't threaten the global model. Your system is anti-fragile, it can handle rapid change 6/ For similar reasons, your digital second brain should only store the *excerpts* from sources that you consume, not entire source texts. Save only the parts that inspire or surprise you, because those feelings are signs of a \"change\" in your model 7/ Trad'l knowledge management was like trad'l relational databases, trying to build a comprehensive model of a person's or organization's knowledge base in a hierarchical, rigid format 8/ This never worked, not just because knowledge doesn't fit into a comprehensive taxonomy, but because as you approached completeness, your model got more rigid and resistant to change, slowing down your learning, making your knowledge obsolete 9/ So knowledge mgmt was inherently self-destructive. But PERSONAL knowledge mgmt puts control of each person's knowledge base in their own hands, and trains them to manage it informally using something like digital notes 10/ The informality is key: because you're free to store only fragments, snippets, and pieces of sources residing elsewhere, you have a record of changes that, like in event sourcing, you're free to fit into new models whenever needed 11/ This makes change no longer threatening – it is more events to fit into more models.

He called my Mom and told her he was flying to Miami after his shift. He jumped on a plane and got to the stadium just in time for the game. As he was heading in, there was a young kid outside the gate going up to people and saying \"anyone have a ticket?\" My father went up to him and said \"come with me\" and they went in together. They had just enough time to call the kid's parent and let them know he was going to the game, and with whom (yes, this was 1968). They didn't realize how good the tix were until they got to their seats - they were close to the field and near the 50 yard line. Although my father is terrible at recognizing celebrities, he knew that Jackie Gleason was sitting behind him. The game was legendary, Joe Namath the underdog made good on his guarantee of a win, and my Dad ended up with a great story that he has told his entire life. And every time he tells the story, we wonder about the kid he took with him and how it must have been for him. And then this year, on the 50th anniversary, it occurred to me and my sibs that we might actually have a chance of finding the \"kid\", who, by my Dad's estimate, is probably about 60 years old now. So here's my question for you: Do you know someone who tells a story about going to Super Bowl III in Miami when they were about 10 years old with a random guy from Boston who worked for the airlines? If that story sounds at all familiar, please message me, and if not, please RT far and wide. My Dad is 82 and it would be so cool if we could connect him with the \"kid.\" Wow Twitter, you get a lot done while I'm sleeping! This seems like it might actually work, so here's a photo of my dad from around 1969. https://t.co/Jz2VYVYI3K Quick update to all of you who have become invested in this story. We have not found him, but the response has been amazing, and we got some great ideas for next steps. We'll be combing footage of the game and the NFL has offered to help us find photos of fans in the crowd. They were sitting in a section with celebrities (so far Jackie Gleason is the only confirmed celebrity, but there are likely more), so this should be a lot easier than if they were sitting in the nosebleeds. Still no promising leads on finding the \"kid\", but we're still trying. NBC Boston interviewed my Dad about his Super Bowl III story.

The Holocaust wasn’t only a genocide of Jews — it was a white supremacist vision of the world put into action. You, Rep. King, represent that vision. Never again is now. https://t.co/jsizgT77E2 Say it with me: The memory of the Holocaust is not a fig leaf for your white supremacy. I visited Auschwitz twice. Most recently in 2017. I carried a photo of my grandfather, my namesake with his siblings who were gassed &amp; cremated by the Nazis. Walking around the barracks, I saw photos of prisoners with my family’s name. It doesn’t get more personal than that. https://t.co/uJV8OWSp3M So when warmongers and racists use the memory of the Holocaust cynically for their political gain, it makes my blood boil. To remember the Holocaust is to hate war, oppose racism and oppression in all form, and fight for freedom and dignity for all. That’s the only takeaway. My parents didn’t get to have aunts, uncles, and cousins because of the Holocaust. To this day, my grandmother refuses to talk about her childhood home in Poland because it’s too painful. You don’t get to use this pain to downplain the pain you are inflicting on others today. I had nightmares because of the Holocaust as a little kid. I remember as a child needing to work through what was it about people like me that was so unworthy. The grandkids of every person in a concentration camp on the border today will go through this too. What was it about people who looked like *me* that was so problematic that they had to do this awful thing to *us*? That’s the starting point in life for many Jews. It’s everyday for black, brown, and native people in this country. Our bodies remember atrocities for centuries. The last thing I’ll say: the Holocaust doesn’t only distill down to the death camps. Someone who escaped the Ghetto isn’t a survivor or the Holocaust for you? That’s absurd. But that’s exactly what is implied every time the Holocaust is used as a historical point of reference. If you think that only being detained and separated from your kids is “not that bad” because genocide is worse, you obviously have never been humiliated or had state control excerted on you. Just imagine your kids seeing you when you are so weak, without control. Heartbreaking. It’s the same people who argue that not being able to buy an assault rifle on demand is tyranny, who then argue that concentration camps aren’t that bad because there are no gas chambers. I’m mad. I’m going to get a drink and play with my baby.

Chang and Shelley Fisher Fishkin, however, it became both more and less. It flourished into a 7-year transnational, interdisciplinary collaboration, a website, public history events, and two books. /2 https://t.co/4kKA3LOuGY But the larger project of recovering the experiences of Chinese RR workers—so important and necessary—dwarfed the question of Leland Stanford’s role and the University’s obligations. And the truth is there are no easy answers. /3 As CA governor, Leland Stanford declared the Chinese “an inferior race,” calling for a “country settled by free white men.” As president of the CPRR, however, he turned to Chinese labor in desperation and justified his choice, describing the Chinese as “quiet” &amp; “industrious.” /4 As many as 20,000 Chinese worked on the CPRR, tunneling through the Sierras. They earned less than white men and did more hazardous work. When they struck for higher wages in 1867, the CPRR cut off their supplies and starved them out. /5 Both literally and figuratively, Chinese workers built Stanford University. First their backbreaking labor on the railroad built Stanford’s vast wealth. Then they helped to construct the university itself, including planting every tree on the iconic Palm Drive. /6 50 Chinese served the Stanfords in their private Palo Alto home, fed them &amp; nursed them through illness. The Stanfords grew fond of their Chinese servants &amp; gave gifts to a chosen few. /7 At the same time, Leland Stanford championed Chinese Restriction &amp; Exclusion as a US senator, working to end Chinese migration. He denounced anti-Chinese violence in CA, but gave into vigilantes’ demands to lay off workers. /8 Just before he died in 1892, Stanford had second thoughts. “One time I had some fears of the Chinese overrunning the country, but for some years I have had none,” he said. “We need the Chinese here to work… I don’t know what we would do without them.” Faint praise, indeed. /9 It feels easier to condemn slavery, and universities’ ties to it, than to condemn this blend of racism/nativism.

Even if you like their “support for Israel” (I don’t, it’s pro-Occupation), you are cannon fodder to them. 1/x https://t.co/m90tqOaisx What fascinates me is the ultra-Orthodox Jews who ally with them, which I think can be read as both groups using each other. Christian Zionists thinking the Jews will help hasten the Rapture and they’ll get zapped, that’s fine. Jews thinking, like, obvs the Rapture won’t happen, but this is great for helping Israel make the Occupation permanent (and, depending on their theology, maybe will hasten the Messiah-who-is-not-Jesus coming and they don’t really care where non-Jews fall in that equation.) Anyway. Christian Zionists often appropriate our stuff and make Big Jewish Noise but they are not our friends, do not wish us well. (NB Christian Zionism is a movement, a thing, I don’t mean just “Christians who happen to believe the State of Israel should exist in whatever way”) They wish us ill, they wish queers and trans folks and probably most POC ill (never mind Jews who are also queer &amp;/or Black etc etc), they, unlike the guy they claim to follow, do not bring love and compassion to the world. They are dangerous &amp; they are running this country. For those of you talking about how some Jews will be \"saved,\" aka convert to Christianity, won't get killed--my friends, you misunderstand if you think that's better. It's roughly same difference viz valuing Jews and our humanity, autonomy, faith. We only matter if we convert. We have a whole martyrology literature around “sanctifying God’s name,” aka preferring death to forced conversion. The Yom Kippur liturgy incl. language specifying explicitly that we’ll let those who pretended to convert under duress to pray with us--bc it wasn't obvious that the answer was yes. In fact, the Kol Nidre prayer may be a formula to annul those conversions. “Saved” isn’t better. We didn’t survive the Inquisition and the Crusades and all those expulsions and pogroms and the Holocaust just to give up at this so-called end. Not gonna happen. End of the world can come &amp; go &amp; there’ll still be a couple of Jews somewhere in some corner studying Torah. I'll say this again, more slowly, here: #NotAllChrisitians are trying to manipulate Jews to bring the end times and don’t care if they’re obliterated (whether death or conversion) in the process. I’m talking about a very. specific. movement. here. Christian Zionist Evangelicals. This eschatological theology we've been discussing depends on supersessionism, which is inherently antisemitic. But also this particular branch of toxic Christian Zionist Evangelicals is also not the only place where supersessionism/replacement theology shows up. So if you are Christian and reading this thread it would be a good and helpful form of allyship to Jews to interrogate the places where it might show up in your own community's thinking, and to do some grappling with that. Even if you're not actively trying to bring the Rapture.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"61802282"},"id_str":"61802282","name":"Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"72389"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"783"},"created_at":"Fri Jul 31 15:58:03 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"96788"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"12"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2200"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"10240"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"183"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"853"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.24789"},"all_hashtags":["NotAllChrisitians"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

Unfortunately, I have been ill for about ten days and haven’t had time to watch until now. He has so many facts incorrect and not all his fault but mostly his own conspiracy theories clouding the truth. Not worth my time more than I will put here. @OANN got a few things wrong which fed this guy. I was never assigned to DIA. I knew Flynn from back in 2005 working terrorism in Iraq. Flynn was one of many people who stood in support of me. Free Mason thing, not my words. @FBI did not call me to notify me of Jenny’s death. That was a mistake in reporting. Jenny and I connected due to both being female law enforcement whistleblowers. There are many of us out there. I offered to Jenny, if she needed, the opportunity to come visit if she felt she was in danger. I was not involved in her work about this Clinton reporting. First I heard of it was with the @true_pundit article. With regards to the documents she had, she didn’t want to put what they were over texts. I told her that a place like @JudicialWatch has the resources to sift through them and action what they saw as critical etc. I was not some psychops agent for whatever this guy is saying. I was a Counterterrorism Agent and supervisor. I worked cases in and outside of the US. The Americas Unit was probably 6 months of my 16 year career. The unit was developed to address homegrown and lone wolf terrorism His conspiracy theories are not aligned with the facts I know.He has every right to ask questions. His final part of the video is something I agree with.People have the absolute right to question what is told to them. Thank goodness we have that right and that people are doing it But when you cherry pick pieces of a 16 year career, hone onto mistakes made in reporting done on TV and then twist dates, positions and facts, you need to then look at the damage that you can do to people. For clarity, I have no idea how the police got my information and what I was listed as. @GeorgWebb gave me Jenny’s last name, an article about her case in California and I had her phone number. I did a Google search, very sophisticated NOT, with her phone number and her name and address popped up along with possible relatives. I gave that to the detective and he ran that information down himself. Jenny and I had a connection due to what experiences we had as female law enforcement. That was the majority of what we talked about. No nefarious Michael Clancy novel type excitement or alternative agenda on either of our parts. We were friends. Trusted friends. These people need to stop trying to make it more than it was to monetize her death.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2775866878"},"id_str":"2775866878","name":"Valiant_defender #ClearFlynnNow ⭐️⭐️⭐️🦅🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"21741"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"4231"},"created_at":"Fri Sep 19 13:44:13 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"36024"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"12"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"86"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"318"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"7"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"26"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.93748"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Sadness","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

Rare is the ability to pair that perspective with views on how to make the cash register ring in the next 30 days. 2/12 🐢 Patience These companies are usually absurdly early entrants into their markets. The kind of founder who tries to solve mobile ordering two years before the iPhone. The SaaS merchant in an on-prem world. They often have more faith than sense. 3/12 ⛏️ Willingness to toil Being early means not having the luxury of easy capital. It usually means an endless stream of tough pilot projects &amp; test deployments. Grabbing revenue wherever it can be had. It's hard, often demoralizing, but necessary. 4/12 ⚙️ M-A-N-A-G-E-M-E-N-T VC-backed startups often have a laissez faire mode of management, but these founders believe in it and invest in it. They’re not micromanagers, but they do try instrument the business from its earliest days. Their survival depends on it. 5/12 💊 Pain tolerance These founders lose key hires to better-funded, higher-profile startups. Competitors raise more money and grow faster (until their faulty models fail). Family asks these entrepreneurs when they’re going to get a real job? It can be painful. For years. 6/12 🔥 Cheerleading I've been involved with a company in this mold for 14 years. TBH, I nearly wrote it off multiple times in the first six years. But whenever I got close, the founder reignited my excitement and did the same for the team. A true super power. 7/12 🏖️ Perspective The difference between a $100M exit and a $1B exit is often just a three-week vacation. Some founders get burnt out after a decade of struggle and take the 1st credible offer for their startup. Just as their growth is about to go exponential. 8/12 🃏 Reputational risk tolerance All startups are risky. But there's a big difference between spending two years at a startup that fails and 10+. These founders define \"all-in\" and leave little room for \"pivoting\" their personal brands. 9/12 It's hard to spot these entrepreneurs. Aside from being \"too early\", many of these traits only present themselves well into the journey, but we should be more mindful about supporting them as they develop. 10/12 These companies are often the least flashy in a portfolio. Because they rarely incite early bidding wars and can raise capital on their own terms later in life, they can also be hugely remunerative to founders and investors alike. 11/12 Beyond the financial consideration, these startups are intrinsically rewarding in the extreme. In an industry that includes jargon like \"flips\" and \"quick wins\", seeing a founder's true vision come to life is so extremely gratifying. 12/12","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"85623871"},"id_str":"85623871","name":"David Frankel","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"15492"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2351"},"created_at":"Tue Oct 27 18:02:14 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"7654"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"12"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"991"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"4829"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"83"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"402"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.95853"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

I like that people are eager to take action. These are the positive people who can, and do, make a difference. This thread is for them. /1 Occasionally, a small number of other folks (possibly Russian bots) post responses discouraging their fellow citizens from taking constructive action, saying it's useless. I call this activity \"sniveling\" and these people \"demoralizers.\" This thread is not for demoralizers. /2 So here are a few ideas for action-oriented people: Write to congress or, better still, call your representative's office. Help a friend, relative or neighbor register to vote. Help someone else register. Make plans to drive someone who needs help getting to the polls. /3 Donate to groups that are doing things about this crisis. (I recommend @CREWcrew and would be happy to supply a link, and there are many other good groups too.) Maybe even make a plan to skip 1 Starbucks coffee a week &amp; make a tiny recurring monthly donation. Every bit helps. /4 Donate to a candidate you like, especially if you've never done that before. No amount is too small. Show up at marches, and help publicize them. Get on a mailing list of a group that helps organize them. (I like @MoveOn and there are many other good groups too.) /5 Sign petitions. Encourage people to sign petitions. If you live near DC, attend a congressional hearing in support of an important issue. If not, attend a hearing of your state legislature. Vote! Always vote. /6 Disseminate info on social media about developments in this unfolding crisis and actions people take in response. Commit not to be a \"demoralizer\" who posts negative comments in response to tweets about actions people take. (\"What good will a letter do? Why bother marching?\") /7 Run for town council, other public office, or even PTA. Write letters to federal agencies. Or call. Demand answers. Get a paid newspaper subscription to support journalism in this crisis. Tell friends and family not to support Trump's emoluments factories (\"businesses\"). /8 Volunteer to be an election worker or maybe an election observer. Volunteer for a campaign. Volunteer to teach English to folks who don't speak it. Volunteer for ANYTHING helpful. Encourage young people to be optimistic and to study hard so they can defend democracy. /9 If you see an administration official meeting in public with a lobbyist or other special interest, take a photo and send it to a news outlet or watchdog group. (Ignore this suggestion whenever taking a photo would be illegal or dangerous.) /10 If you see executives or lobbyists for a company with interests before the government (for example, a private prison company) frequenting Trump's businesses, share that information. (I'm talking about you, T-Mobile guy!) /11 Make a plan and commit to taking one concrete, constructive action before the Fourth of July.

Please, for the love of all good in the world, READ and spread this around. Literally anyone who uses @discordapp even a little should know this stuff. ADD TO THE LIST!! 1. How does it start? You'll get a DM from someone on your friends list, in a groupchat with you, and/or with mutual servers. DON'T CLICK (obviously) The DM seems to have multiple forms. I've seen two so far, if someone's seen more, please do share: https://t.co/D153PiZ6T6 2. What is the link exactly? The link is made to look like a legit Discord link--it's not. It has Discord's embed forged, and if you read the link closely, it's not \"discord dot gg\" as Discord uses; rather, it's \"discord gg dot ga\". This is meant to trip you up into clicking. https://t.co/7z7QRb2rQl 3. Where does the link lead to? The link will take you to a fake login page. This is intricately forged to look EXACTLY like Discord's plain login. The trick is that you think it's a legit Discord login, so you put in your email &amp; pass like normal, thinking all is good till now. 4. What happens then? Your account is taken. In reality, you just gave your email &amp; pass to the system running this shit--and before you know it, a bot is now in your account. It locks you out by changing your pass &amp; email, so without 2FA you're not getting back in anytime soon. 5. What does it do on my account? Exactly what it did to you using your friends' account(s). The bot goes through your friends, DMs, server members, and groupchats, sending the same messages in hopes of tricking more &amp; more people &amp; gaining control of more accounts over Discord. 6. Why is this such a big deal? Discord accounts hold a lot of info!! I'm sure a lot of people reading this have things on their account they wouldn't want even friends seeing, let alone a virus. Also, for server staff &amp; owners, this means SERIOUS danger. Scary shit can go down. 7. I got the virus and my account is sending the link everywhere. What do I do? --Make a new account with a familiar name+pfp --Reach out to as many trusted people from your old account (friends, server staff, etc.) --Look for invites online of servers you were in that you trust 7. (cont) --In servers, reach out to trusted staff &amp; friends. Explain what happened calmly. Maybe have some way of proving it's you --Get a friend to help vouch to server staff/others that you really are you --Ask for help getting in touch with other friends &amp; their Discord tags 8. I know/am friends with someone with the virus. What do I do? --Remove their old acct from all groupchats (see who's group owner, they can remove) --Unfriend &amp; tell others to unfriend --Save anything you need from y'all's DMs --On their new acct, HELP them reach out to friends https://t.co/NEXddIi2Jr 9. I am staff of a server, and a member got the virus. What do I do? --Get the new acct into the server FIRST --Copy over all roles/notes/perms to the new acct --Give new acct any rewards/ranks etc (Bot EXP, guild score/rank, etc.) the old acct has --Ban old acct without a purge https://t.co/NyYGhZHu2Z 10. How can we fight this? --2FA! 2FA! 2FA! It takes SECONDS. Enable it on your acct, encourage friends &amp; members to enable it! --SEND REPORTS TO DISCORD! This is quite easily one of the scariest viruses to spread around Discord--if we push, they will stop it sooner than later!! https://t.co/NiT575wUMF","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"926051314882306048"},"id_str":"926051314882306048","name":"SplatterShah (shah#1222)","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"1472"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"247"},"created_at":"Thu Nov 02 11:40:13 +0000 2017","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"1664"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"12"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"43801"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"68280"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3650"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5690"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.93335"},"all_hashtags":["Discord"],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Anger"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

More than 12 Dems voted for the heartbeat bill. Several are people of color...like @RepKJackson. This is mirrors a (local) trend https://t.co/m1pYu97R0S 2/ National media don't know what to do with this. Instead of allowing racial/ideological diversity to challenge their given abortion narrative, they reply on 1980s stereotypes. Of Jackson they said \"Her party’s preferences are no match for her own deeply held religious beliefs.\" 3/ Dismissiveness drips from these words. \"Deeply held religious beliefs\" are put in a box which gets marginalized from the discourse. Magisterial figures like Linda Greenhouse even argue the establishment clause prohibits them from being basis of law. https://t.co/nnHpkQRsFw 4/ This methodology is only employed, of course, when the views in question are objectionable. When @PeteButtigieg says his faith guides his views about, say, ecological protection...there is no dismissiveness. His religious language is either overlooked or framed positively. 5/ It would be impossible imagine a @WashingtonPost reporter penning this sentence: \"Though most US Americans don't prioritize climate change the priorities of the American people are no match for Mayor Pete's religious beliefs.\" One might argue that the moral view of climate... 6/ ...change has a secular component to the argument and that's what makes it different. But the same is true with abortion, which most pro-lifers see as about human rights. Pope Francis recent remarks on justice for the prenatal child explicitly frame it in non-religious terms. 7/ .@secularprolife recently pointed out that a whopping 13 million pro-lifers ID as non-religious. *13 million*! https://t.co/Td7aW2tAPo This group is equal to the entire population of Illinois. The idea that an anti-abortion position is inherently religious is totally outdated. 8/ The WaPo article also assumes abortion-rights Dem party orthodoxy throughout, but this is true only with coastal, overwhelmingly white elites. The full party, esp if one takes religious people of color seriously, one must embrace diversity on this issue. At least if Dems... 9/ ...want to win in places like South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas. Indeed, pro-life messaging works best with what some might call the Dem's base. https://t.co/JvCltAH6A7 WaPo article suggested Dem party changed on abortion, but its more accurate to say pro-lifers left. 10/ Dems will desperately need to win them back if they want to win the Senate and to keep the House in 2020. Many pro-lifers are looking around for alternatives to Trump, but white progressive leadership doesn't give them anywhere reasonable to land. Many will simply stay home. 11/ Having a national debate about this, though, requires changing abortion coverage. Let go of 1980s assumptions. Embrace wide nonbinary view of the issue. Talk at length with locals outside of I-95 corridor, especially people of color. And most important: embrace complexity.

A: No Not even at an embassy? A: No https://t.co/lyzsFTGZO5 If a person seeking asylum crosses the border illegally, does that make them an “illegal immigrant”? A: No. Unauthorized entry is a misdemeanor offense that has no bearing on a person’s eligibility for Asylum. https://t.co/PSxa1jJg2b But didn’t Trump say that if they cross illegally they can’t apply for asylum? A: Yes. Trump is not a reliable immigration law source. The federal judge who injuncted his attempt to use misdemeanor unauthorized entry as a bar to asylum, is. https://t.co/rc1pUoCgtc What must applicants show to receive asylum? A: they are unable or unwilling to return to their home country due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future same on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. https://t.co/bVb5dz00gH Do asylum applicants have to prove this stuff to apply?

In reality these claims can take much longer. https://t.co/eLfq0N69xn How many asylum claims are granted? A: approximately 44% of total asylum claims filed are granted. Roughly 10% of claims filed by refugees from Central America are granted. https://t.co/VzLdYZAT7x Can applicants appeal a denial? A: Yes. Applicants have 16 days to respond to a notice of intent to deny and provide additional facts to support their claim. https://t.co/0mdgXbU7pQ What happens when asylum (including all available appeals up to and including SCOTUS) is denied? A: Removal proceedings are initiated and barring some other claim of eligibility (they exist) the applicant is deported. Are asylum seekers criminals paid by Soros to ruin America?

Goddamn, the stories are practically going to write themselves, aren't they? https://t.co/21xSioIBj0 https://t.co/36PRPyqgsv You'll want start at the bottom of page 83. The FBI was letting subcontractors have access to raw SIGINT, which the subcontractors were then using to make Section 702 unmasking queries. In April of 2016, NSA head Mike Rogers noticed the unusually high # of Sec. 702 queries to unmask the names of US citizens being made by the FBI. He investigated &amp; discovered, much to his horror, it was coming from a FBI subcontractor &amp; unmasked names = Trump campaign team. Rogers took action to demand a complete review of all Sec. 702 queries, something that shut the entire process down subsequent to April 2016. Recall in his hastily called for press conference in March, 2017, Devin Nunes stated he was shown unmasked names of Trump transition team members collected in intel intercepts having NOTHING to do with Russia or any foreign country. https://t.co/7uWZoHjSs9 The Hillary campaign/DNC hiring of Fusion GPS who then hired Christopher Steele &amp; Nellie Ohr to begin collecting Russian info for their Trump dossier began in June 2016. June is....after April. April, May, June. See the problem here, Olivia? One thing I got from that Nunes presser last March is that whatever he was shown shocked and scared the living HELL out of him. Was he looking at unmasked 702 queries of Trump campaign team people from pre-April 2016? Because he very well could've been. IF, as I've been hearing, the Fusion GPS bank records show they were being paid as an FBI subcontractor as part of a unit doing Section 702 unmasking queries of raw SIGINT gathered on the Trump campaign prior to April 2016, this scandal dwarfs Watergate. Having it's access to the raw NSA SIGINT through the FBI abruptly cut off by Mike Rogers, Fusion then gets hired by HRC/DNC to compile the Steele Dossier which is used to get surveillance of Trump's team started back up through the FISA court granting a warrant. Now, you can start to spend some time looking into a scandal that dwarfs Watergate, if you so choose. Or you can spend another 5 months writing about minor process violations of people like Paul Manafort, Rick Who? and General Flynn.

I’ve had a number of people ask why, or seem surprised, so I thought I’d lay out my rationale in case it is of interest to others. Over the years I converged on what we call coin maximalism, or minimalism. That is, “blockchain” was developed to solve a very specific problem, and it did so at a massive sacrifice. That problem: ensuring that ledger entries can’t be double spent when there’s no central party. If you can create a central party, don’t use a “blockchain”. If you don’t believe that ledger entry has value, don’t use it. That ledger entry, like money, has value through mass belief. So I believe we’ll converge around one. In this case, bitcoin is the one to beat. Last August, I left EY with the goal of starting a business to assist with adoption of bitcoin in one of two ways: helping institutionalize it, or helping adoption in the developing world. I covered my views on this in this article: https://t.co/djXaltSOYz I quickly worked out that I’m not going to be able to build bitcoin adoption in the developing world. I will never know enough about it, and additionally: you fundamentally can’t build a legitimate business that is also decentralized to resist government intervention. I also found that institutions were not going to be onboarding bitcoin as a financial product as quickly as I had thought they would from my discussions over the years. Institutionalization has happened, but not as much as I’d expected and enough for me to build a business on it. There are some fantastic companies making great strides with bitcoin adoption in the institutional and consumer space. It is, however, in my view crowded for the state of the market as it stands now. You also can’t rush people to believe that something has value. Finally, I have believed for the past few years that there would be a ‘great cleansing’, where over a period of a year or two, people would slowly withdraw from all the useless blockchain projects going on. I’m losing confidence the market will become rational any time soon. I’m as confident in Bitcoin’s ability to radically transform the world as I ever have been. However I believe the time horizon to do that is very long, and I believe my best bet in the industry is to simply buy and hold. Do not read this in any way as me saying goodbye to the bitcoin industry. I’ll always be involved in the bitcoin industry in one way or another. Starting to think I should have put these last two tweets first. I’ve been told I’m “rage quitting” by someone who doesn’t work in the industry and been told I’m not thinking big enough about blockchain.

Obama didn't fire Flynn as the head of the DIA because Flynn wouldn't go along with all his happy happy talk about ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood and the terror threat.

Let's talk about that for a second. First of all, this country was given a \"D\" in drinking water infrastructure by @ASCEGovRel last year and it will cost $1 trillion to fix it. https://t.co/hr2b2zd83C In most places in Appalachia, you can't drink the water. At all. Ever. Martin County, KY has had contaminated water for decades, and people aren't given notices of violations until months after. https://t.co/nxFs2furxc Perry County, Kentucky is similar. I wrote a story for @HuffPost about the water quality issues there. One woman I spoke to hikes up a mountain to find clean spring water when her water goes out in the winter. https://t.co/gLJPB0gyDc According to @ewg data, nearly all of the top ten most polluted water districts in the states of Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia are in Appalachia. West Virginia has a high number of violations as well. Just click on the states to take a look. https://t.co/OZWhc40jfg As a personal anecdote, my partner lives in Whitesburg, Kentucky —one of the bigger cities in the Central Appalachian region — and you don't drink the water. Ever. I wrote about it in a @southerlymag newsletter a while back: https://t.co/G8jMICBVrz Google \"coal slurry spill Appalachia\" and you'll come up with hundreds of examples. Egregious spills that were never cleaned up, hardly investigated, forgotten about. Here's a @wvgazettemail example from 2014: https://t.co/KBOfd1cgTG And now, with the pipeline boom in Appalachia, more drinking water could potentially be contaminated. Virginia water board just voted not to consider revoking stream-crossing permits for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. via @roanoketimes https://t.co/NqZJYxrwO8 As a reporter in this region, I can tell you that getting people to care about the lack of clean water in Appalachia is incredibly difficult. I've been trying to report on it for months, and other journalists have been trying to hold the states/industries accountable for years. My final thought for now: Appalachians know they've been harmed by coal industry. They are angry and fighting for clean water, and rightfully angry no one has paid attention to that fact. They're not buying these claims, and media needs to quit assuming they are. Here are some of the organizations doing legal, organizing, policy work on water that you can follow: @AppCitizensLaw @macedky @AppVoices @kftc @selc_org (please feel free to add any I've missed, or add stories on water in #Appalachia to this thread) While I have y'all, please subscribe to @southerlymag, my new independent media org that covers these types of issues in Appalachia and the South (spoiler: there are many others like it and they are underreported) https://t.co/9304ck602V","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"110727296"},"id_str":"110727296","name":"Lyndsey Gilpin","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"10260"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1228"},"created_at":"Tue Feb 02 15:25:31 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"5969"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"12"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"22677"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"63552"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1890"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5296"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.98084"},"all_hashtags":["Appalachia"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Anger"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

(1) ... a crime was committed, a very serious crime: a computer hack. It's no less a burglary for stealing digital rather than physical property. Same crime as Watergate. (2) All the way back in the summer of 2016, everybody knew who committed this crime: Russian military intelligence. Claims that maybe it was an \"inside job\" etc. were floated in bad faith by untruthful people - but everybody knew, the Trump campaign very much included. (3) When Donald Trump Jr. accepted his famous Trump Tower meeting, he was hoping to receive the proceeds of a crime. He was disappointed in that hope, but that's what he hoped. (4) And when the proceeds of the crime did begin to be posted on the WikiLeaks site later in the summer of 2016 and -devastatingly - less than 1 hour after the reporting of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016, everybody understand that this was Putin acting to help Trump (5) None of this bears any resemblance to \"oppo research\" - information obtained lawfully by asking questions, reading archives, etc. It was crime, no less criminal for being outsourced to foreigners beyond the reach of US prosectors (6) The Mueller report found insufficient evidence to convict anyone on the Trump campaign of culpability in the crime. But it stressed: the crime was committed by Russian military intelligence to help Trump, and the Trump campaign knowingly welcomed that help (7) If the Trump campaign had flown a private investigator to Moscow to interview people about the (bogus) Uranium One Clinton story ... nobody would object. That is oppo research. If they trawled old Arkansas police records in search of something discrediting ... again, research (8) What fellow Republicans first and then Democrats later hired Christopher Steele to do - interview people, collect rumors, sift through them - falls into this former category. The quality of Steele's work you can dispute. He committed no crimes in course of doing it. (9) Trump Jr's visitors in June 2016 purported to deliver - and Trump's actual helpers later in the year did actually deliver - the proceeds of crimes. In full light of day, and with Trump on video urging them onward. (10) The Trump campaign was absolved of criminal culpability by Mueller in large part on issue o intent. Did they truly understand they were being invited to participate in a crime? Did they truly wish to participate? And could that be proven beyond reasonable doubt? (11) That's why President Trump's words to ABC were so important. He was asked, now that you have full knowledge of all that was at issue - including the crime committed by the Putin regime by hacking Americans - would you receive that information again? Trump answered YES. (12) Trump confessed the thing Mueller could not prove.

Do not fall into Trump's trap that this is just more of the same, more partisan sniping from the Swamp from swamp creatures.... 3) These officials are not—repeat not—monetizing their security clearances by being on cable TV. In fact, having covered many of these officials for years, I can tell you that they would prefer to be doing anything but being on TV. 4) What they are doing is offering the clearest warning they can, speaking—as intel officials are supposed to do—truth to power, telling hard truths, that America faces a dire situation. 5) I spent months profiling Jim Clapper when he was DNI; back then, he went out of his way to say nothing, to avoid controversy, to eschew politics, to focus on the work before him. https://t.co/yALqFbVHDt 6) All of them would have preferred to sit on the sidelines of politics. They spent their careers avoiding it and would prefer to remain off the public radar. 7) All Clapper wanted to do when he left office was slip quietly into the night and clean out his basement. He'd been retired before—for six years—and never did TV commentary or cable news before. But those were \"normal\" years, under Clinton and W. 8) Altogether, Clapper spent nearly 50 years in public service. Hayden did about 40 years. McRaven 36. Brennan too, more than 30. These are not partisan hacks. They don't scare easily. They don't cry wolf. 8) All of them were trained to keep quiet on politics. So the fact that they're not silent, that all of them—all of them—are screaming from the rooftops about Trump's threats to our country, our rule of law, our democratic institutions, should chill us. https://t.co/tzEvZlf5jI 9) I was there last summer at @aspensecurity as Clapper and Brennan let loose on Trump. I was gobsmacked. I had read every word Jim Clapper has said in public in a decade. I had never imagined I'd hear him speak as ominously and fearfully as he did. https://t.co/Se8XRqFhJd 10) I remain stunned by the words and warning that come from Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, McRaven, and others today. 11) They are telling us this is a dark and dangerous time. And they have spent their lives, devoted their entire careers, to protecting the country from just these sorts of events overseas. That they're warning us we're under threat at *home*. That's a warning worth listening to.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"926601"},"id_str":"926601","name":"Garrett M.

(1x) Now, Ilhan Omar is a national disgrace. Globally, anti-Semites are emboldened. We warned them. None of this would have happened if @StarTribune, afraid of a PC mob, had not withheld the facts from local voters. Covering their tracks, tonight @StarTribune published ...

We are reporters; they are frauds. They owe us, MN voters, and the global Jewish community an apology.

Please read our work, not theirs -- all of our articles are linked in this thread: https://t.co/IAM0AbUIJi (4/x) The @StarTribune also, inexplicably, failed to put two facts together on a bombshell development mentioned in their article. @StarTribune appears to have been deliberately vague; I can only surmise that the paper is still covering for Omar.

(6/x) Elmi's posts show he has lived in Nairobi, Kenya since between 12/21/18 and 1/14/19. And Noor’s company is clearly located in Nairobi, not just somewhere in “Kenya.” Further, it’s provable Elmi has been working for Noor, apparently helping out with her company website. (7/x) Look for yourself: Visit https://t.co/YitQVPPWm5, then view the page’s source code. You will see that Elmi was logged into his personal Instagram account while he was creating the link to Noor’s company Instagram account. (8/x) https://t.co/UmvVDyrgxi There is no reasonable explanation for this code to exist besides Elmi working for Noor. And that's a bombshell: In 2017, Ilhan Omar swore, under penalty of perjury while divorcing Elmi, that she had zero contact with him since 2011 -- and no clue how to find him. (9/x) Just 1 year later, Elmi, having just been divorced without being served, leaves London to work for his ex-wife's sister in Nairobi? It’s absurd. Yet the @StarTribune chose to not even report Elmi and Noor were both living in Nairobi. (10/x) As for what’s next: The @StarTribune is wasting its time seeking Omar’s immigration documents. The documents reveal irregularities -- such as two sisters born only two months apart -- but will not provide proof of a fraudulent marriage. I will confirm here that ... (11/x) ... I have identified other documentation that, according to sources and additional evidence, will confirm the fraudulent marriage. An attorney is currently assisting me in attempting to obtain them legally. In the following week or so ...

They may have evangelists, but the actual, rigorous research, the trials and case studies and ethnographies, will see, at best, a weak signal. Most likely it's inconclusive. Take choice of language: large Github scale studies don't see evidence it reduces defects that much: https://t.co/aiXqadVAaA TDD? Results are mixed. It might trade effort for defects (https://t.co/ZYZ1qRpYQk)... or maybe it doesn't reduce defects at all! https://t.co/aA5X0b0XFv Clean Code?

On one side, we have vast troves of papers in many different contexts showing dramatic impact of sleep, workload, and stress levels on our competence and productivity. On the other hand, we have precious few tool/method studies that all find no benefit or are inconclusive. To me, this is beautiful. It elevates us. Our most precious gift is the capacity to think. Our limits are not defined by whether we prefer Rust to Haskell or Scrum to Kanban, but how much we're burdened by stress and sleep deprivation.

Non-autistic people sometimes think that autistic people who don't have an intellectual disability are automatically better at not having meltdowns, or at prevention and de-escalation for themselves. Sorry, nope. Those are learned skills, and the teaching of those skills is not readily available off the shelf. Searching for help for that for years and not finding it drove me even further into self-harm. You can have a postgrad degree and a vocabulary that would win a spelling contest, but an autistic meltdown is still a meltdown, no matter how academically you spew your caustic insults. But she's so intelligent! But she's so high functioning! Right. And she can drive a car too. Yay. But she's also autistic, and autism isn't just rainbow lemniscates on t-shirts, it's sometines also horrible for everyone. Please don't imagine that we LIKE having meltdowns. I don't LIKE that I hurt people during meltdowns. My meltdown behaviour caused my best friend in the whole world to develop PTSD. MY BEST FRIEND. So, think about when you have been unreasonable and illogical and rude and hurtful during a meltdown and done things you regretted. In fact, no, don't even think about it too deeply yet, I know how hard it is to face all that you did when you were out of control, and that somehow just before that, something bad happened to you too, and for a moment you saw no other options. Got that thought, though, safely contained, but within sight? Good. Now, bear this in mind when someone else has a meltdown, and know that they may not be the champion you are today, who can deflect and redirect and contain the volcano. Tomorrow we can check how much is left of the town and learn to do better within time. For now, I am going to bed. Forgive each other. See you later.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"17630756"},"id_str":"17630756","name":"Tania | AutisticStrategies.Net | #OptimiseAutism","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"1869"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2738"},"created_at":"Tue Nov 25 20:40:53 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"42572"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"13"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"38"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"313"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"24"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.7373"},"all_hashtags":["ActuallyAutistic"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"1"}}

This confirms my overall thesis on Mueller’s involvement in other ongoing investigations and the fact that MUELLER LOOKED INTO THE OTHER SIDE! Watch this clip and read! https://t.co/Ye7bPuL0OF 2) This is clouded legal speak that is hard for regular folk to catch up on. Let’s break it down. “Our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office” Mueller’s product from his work is being decided on in an office separate from the SC. 3) Read that again. Mueller’s product is being reviewed elsewhere and the decision on what to do with his findings are being “decided” on by other entities. Mueller is referring to all these “unspecified criminal investigations” as seen in the Flynn sentencing memo! See below. https://t.co/12YT1Ha4WR 4) The dems/MSM assumed that the “unspecified criminal investigations” had something to do with Trump/Russia. Even though in the Flynn memo it clearly states that the criminal investigation is separate from the Mueller Russian interference SC. Folks, Mueller found something. 5) But what he found had fallen outside the scope of his investigation, which was specifically “Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election”. Mueller found this in his 19 interviews with Flynn in which Flynn was required to give knowledge of “any and all crimes”. https://t.co/tRh8sRqC3z 6) General Flynn, white hat/Q team, knows a plethora of crimes ranging from Uranium One to the Weiner Laptop. When we talk about “legal injection” this is what we mean. Flynn purposefully caught a minor process charge so he could testify about EVERYTHING! HUGE Q PROOF! 👇🏻 https://t.co/bmyH096Ght 7) What Mueller said in this presser confirms what was already in the documentation. He found crimes, and those crimes were handed off to other investigators. When he says “a process that does not involve our office”, I cannot confirm who he is referring to. Huber? Durham? Idk. 8) What I do know is that if Flynn gave Mueller all crimes with which he was familiar, and those interviews assisted in multiple ongoing criminal investigations, and those investigations are SEPARATE from the Mueller/Russia SC, THAT LEAVES ONE POSSIBILITY. The other side. #PAIN https://t.co/3EJkQuMaYl 9) This is huge. This confirms everything. This confirms Mueller was conducting a fair investigation and looked into matters on both sides. Now the SC is done, Trump team is clear, and the ongoing criminal investigations with sitting grand juries continue to work in the shadows. 10) So the options are: Mueller is a white/grey hat who investigated both sides. Or Mueller is a black hat, running a coup from within Trump’s own DOJ, yet failed to damage Trump and accidentally investigated his own side. He’s either a white hat or the worst black hat ever. 11) This is the reason I am so calm and so confident in the situation is because I know the legality and I know that there are multiple ongoing criminal investigations into the other side and Mueller assisted in these findings. Mueller is our guy. He has been since 5/17/17. 12) In summary, We got a member of Q team (Flynn) to testify about all crimes with which he was familiar and Mueller handed it off to other criminal investigations. Mueller assisted in gathering information that will prosecute the deep state. “LEGAL INJECTION” https://t.co/mMzov7YL74 13) Huge shoutout to @GodandCountry11 She is the one who found this little detail that I managed to overlook amidst the pandemonium of the past couple days. Share this thread far and wide. The world needs to know. Pain is coming.

Since I (literally) wrote the book on unfiltered outsider Presidents (https://t.co/UP9GUmDVVu) this seems like the time for my first-ever Tweet storm: Little if any of Trump’s behavior in office has been even slightly surprising. He is who he was before taking power. Corruption? Mismanagement? Erratic hiring and firing? Constant random outbursts of temper? Narcissistic boasting? Barely-coded racism? This is who he always was. The big change has been the steady erosion of the buffers that have (more than most people appreciate) protected us from his worst traits. McMaster and even Tillerson pushed out, Kelly marginalized, etc. Trump is so awful that he makes even someone like Sessions look kind of good Worsening the situation is that Trump is (rightly!) terrified of investigations into his business practices. Whatever he did w/ Russia, it’s been clear that the “Trump Organization” is just a front for fairly inept white collar crime, particularly money laundering, for a while The New Yorker piece by @adamdavidson lays this out clearly, but it’s been obvious to anyone who looked at his business since long before the election, and both Mueller’s team and the SDNY will have no difficulty following the money Additionally, whether or not Trump has underlying health issues, the Presidency itself is likely changing him by exaggerating his underlying tendencies (power tends to make people worse) and insulating him from any feedback that might tend to moderate his behavior While Trump’s staff is increasingly a mixture of sycophants willing to tell him what he wants to hear, ambitious Republicans willing to do anything for short-term career advancement, true believers like Miller, and a shrinking handful of patriots trying to mitigate the damage This plus his increasing age (https://t.co/n60VE7ZUmv) means that Trump’s own tendencies (the narcissism, rage, lack of self-control, reactive responses to any challenge, use of racial political appeals, managerial incoherence, etc.) are going to get even more exaggerated This is not a hopeful story. So far, like a wealthy family living off its capital, the US government has maintained some level of functionality through institutional memory, the strength of the civil service, luck, and Jim Mattis. But this will get harder w/ each passing day With Trump feeling Mueller’s hot breath on the back of his neck and the SDNY clearly deep into another, perhaps even-more threatening to him investigation, the increasing pressure will only add to the toxic stew inside the White House There will be a rupture. If it doesn’t come before the 2018 elections, a major Democratic victory there will scare/shock him so much that one will surely come soon after. The most powerful empire in human history is governed by someone who is erratic at best _and getting worse_ Democrat, Republican, or Independent, the only thing that matters is working to maximize the odds that 1) It can be put off until after the elections, 2) Democratic majorities will then be able to contain him, and 3) No wars or other catastrophes until then The only people who can make that happen are the swing Republican Senators. @SenatorCollins, @lisamurkowski, and @JeffFlake - history’s eyes are on you like no triumvirate of Senators since Webster/Calhoun/Clay in the 19th century.

Trump is a privileged and mentally deficient petty conman and all-round shitlord born in 1946. Having inherited a ton of cash but no brains from his walking psycho’s gun license photo of a father, he spent his formative years punching teachers and diligently fostering a constellation of horrible psychological disorders. In the early 70s Donald bitched out of Vietnam with leg rot to become a full-time pervert and thieving racist slum lord under the tutelage of his mooching dad. In 1977, he made a formal commitment to ruin the life of model Ivana Zelnickoya Winklmayr by marrying her. The couple then ruined the lives of three children by creating them. Around the time these lovebirds were smashing out a string of pointless clones, Donnie was sniffing around the gambling business. He got land in Atlantic City, promptly built fifty mobbed-up casinos on the same street, and ran them into the ground where they mouldered like dusty golden blocks of cheese, tragic monuments to the greed and epic stupidity of a morally and financially bankrupt opportunist. In the nineties, DJT was so in hock he had less money than any of the minorities he hated but that didn’t stop him tossing bank loans around like confetti at a series of piss-worthless business ventures going into the 2010s. These included an airline, a mortgage company, a cosplay university course, a magazine, a board game, and vodka and steak brands, all of which shit the bed faster than a motel drunk on a suicide booze jaunt to Ebola Town. Somewhere along the fucking way, he managed to impregnate one American lady no one remembers and the haunted plastic robot that remains his wife to this day. The resulting offspring have appeared very infrequently, and only in blurry photographs from a distance like the ones of Bigfoot. In 2016, after years fronting a moistly ego-driven ode to sociopathy called The Apprentice, The Donald was propelled to the White House on a wave of bigotry, Russian propaganda, shit media coverage, apathy, and voter suppression. He has spent every waking moment since then cheating at golf, tweeting typos on a greasy phone, and struggling with umbrellas while the urine-hued foot-long cotton candy he erroneously refers to as a haircut tries to flee the Chernobyl wildlife autopsy of his vindictively butchered scalp. Meanwhile, he’s trashed the State Department and EPA while hurling stacks of money at the people who need it the very least. Hate crimes are up, real wages stagnant, and the number of chronically confused dunces braying for a wall about the same as in 2016. Perhaps they will achieve their goal of creating a vast and oil-filled forced birth pit to roll around in, protected by an ugly circular concrete barrier mounted with cheap machine gun installations and bathed in lung-shredded smog and acid rain. There they will wallow, bellowing hallucinated false claims about pallets of hostage cash and adrenochrome-harvesting pizza joints with fictional basements, riddled with malignant glyphosate tumours and bragging about an extra dollar in their monthly paychecks. We do not yet know what will become of their mad king Donnie, Prince of Whales, but experts predict he’ll either nuke us all or throw a blood clot around ’21, leaving behind a brittle and shell-shocked country crawling with emboldened crooks and insane conservative judges. I tried to remain as unbiased as possible in the writing of this article.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"4376835677"},"id_str":"4376835677","name":"BookdiggerJim: Half Man, Half Robot...

President Trump has engaged in impeachable conduct. 3. Partisanship has eroded our system of checks and balances. 4. Few members of Congress have read the report. I offer these conclusions only after having read Mueller’s redacted report carefully and completely, having read or watched pertinent statements and testimony, and having discussed this matter with my staff, who thoroughly reviewed materials and provided me with further analysis. In comparing Barr’s principal conclusions, congressional testimony, and other statements to Mueller’s report, it is clear that Barr intended to mislead the public about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s analysis and findings. Barr’s misrepresentations are significant but often subtle, frequently taking the form of sleight-of-hand qualifications or logical fallacies, which he hopes people will not notice. Under our Constitution, the president “shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” While “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” is not defined, the context implies conduct that violates the public trust. Contrary to Barr’s portrayal, Mueller’s report reveals that President Trump engaged in specific actions and a pattern of behavior that meet the threshold for impeachment. In fact, Mueller’s report identifies multiple examples of conduct satisfying all the elements of obstruction of justice, and undoubtedly any person who is not the president of the United States would be indicted based on such evidence. Impeachment, which is a special form of indictment, does not even require probable cause that a crime (e.g., obstruction of justice) has been committed; it simply requires a finding that an official has engaged in careless, abusive, corrupt, or otherwise dishonorable conduct. While impeachment should be undertaken only in extraordinary circumstances, the risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ it as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct. Our system of checks and balances relies on each branch’s jealously guarding its powers and upholding its duties under our Constitution. When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution, the Rule of Law—the foundation of liberty—crumbles. We’ve witnessed members of Congress from both parties shift their views 180 degrees—on the importance of character, on the principles of obstruction of justice—depending on whether they’re discussing Bill Clinton or Donald Trump. Few members of Congress even read Mueller’s report; their minds were made up based on partisan affiliation—and it showed, with representatives and senators from both parties issuing definitive statements on the 448-page report’s conclusions within just hours of its release. America’s institutions depend on officials to uphold both the rules and spirit of our constitutional system even when to do so is personally inconvenient or yields a politically unfavorable outcome. Our Constitution is brilliant and awesome; it deserves a government to match it.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"233842454"},"id_str":"233842454","name":"Justin Amash","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"327168"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"5760"},"created_at":"Tue Jan 04 07:09:11 +0000 2011","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"16136"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"13"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"240561"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"951561"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"18505"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"73197"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.15844"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

Having the lowest probability 1/13 of injury, out of more than 900 vehicles analyzed, is no small feat, and it’s driving record sales. The Tesla Model 3 is followed by the Model S, and Model X as the safest cars ever tested by the NHTSA. One of the most important reasons why the Tesla Model 3 is so much 2/13 safer than many of its competitors is because of its Electric Vehicle (EV) drivetrain when compared to the dangers posed by a traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The Tesla Model 3 was packed full of safety features and innovations which helped it to rank safer 3/13 than any other vehicle tested in 2019. Check out this video to learn more about the Tesla Model 3’s key safety innovations: https://t.co/OWNUHFyoSP Tesla Model 3 Becomes California’s 3rd Most Popular Car 4/13 The Model 3 is currently the third most popular vehicle in the key automotive market California. The only cars currently selling more units, in that market, through the first half of 2019, are the Honda Civic and Toyota Camry. Each long standing as among America’s top 5/13 car sales performers. Norway Continues to Distinguish itself as a Key Electric Vehicle Market Success of the Tesla Model 3 is not limited to North America. The car is doing tremendously well in all of Europe. Norway, considered a key market in the electrification of 6/13 the automotive industry. In Norway, through the first 6 months of 2019, half of all vehicles sold were electric. Since, 2013 when the Tesla Model S went on sale there, more than 20,000 units were shipped. 12,000 Model Xs have been registered in Norway since 2016. In the 7/13 second half of 2019, there are more than 40,000 Tesla Model 3 registrations in Norway. Tesla European Sales Overtake Porsche The safe, affordable, electric Tesla Model 3 is performing so well across Europe, it is now anticipated to sell more units than all Porsches 8/13 combined. This speaks to the incredible vision that Tesla has offered as well as to how well consumers are responding to it. While major German automotive brands like Mercedes, BMW, and Audi dominate European automotive sales, Tesla is quickly overtaking smaller niche 9/13 brands. With 31,065 cars sold in Europe through the first 5 months of 2019, the company is already selling faster than Porsche.

In 2019, with tons of interest in the all-electric Porsche Taycan and new versions of the 911 Carrera, Tesla is rapidly stealing away vital market share. 11/13 Jaguar may be the next niche automotive maker to lose vital positioning thanks to the success of Tesla, driven by international reception to its Model 3 and hype for new product releases. In 2019, Tesla Model Sales began in February. These numbers also only reflect 12/13 sales through May. More deliveries of Teslas will occur in June and those numbers will likely climb.

Our industry tends to fetishize the technical architectures of companies like Google, Netflix, etc. They have built some impressive tech to solve rare scaling issues, so this is not surprising. However, does your company/system need similar solutions? Probably not... The backlash against service mesh, K8S, and other ☁️ native tech is based, reasonably IMO, on the view that vendor marketing and big tech thought-leading are causing smaller orgs to not see the forest for the trees and adopt solutions that are too complex for their actual needs. If you have a new/small distributed system: ✔️ Monolith ✔️ Untyped language/API, go wild ✔️ Monorepo, why not ✔️ ☁️ FaaS, yes please ✔️ MongoDB? Web scale ✖️ Service mesh ✖️ K8S ✖️ Anything else that anyone thought-leads about on here. Focus on creating customer value and keep things as simple and boring as possible for as long as possible. BUT, if you are lucky enough to find success, your development team will grow, you will end up moving to SoA, and then the 💩 will hit the fan: - Untyped languages and APIs won't feel so productive anymore. - That monorepo? Don't even get me started. - Today's state of the art FaaS is not going to cut it in terms of reliability, obs, networking, etc. - You WILL start feeling the SoA networking/obs pain. At this point, the \"service mesh\" is coming for you one way or the other because the problems of obs, load balancing, service discovery, consistent timeouts, retries, etc. must be solved or your SoA is DOA. Are you an all Java shop? Finagle or Hystrix are great choices. Are you an all Go shop? Try something like Micro. Are you polyglot? You can either plow a ⛰️ of resources into custom libraries in every language, or you can embrace the sidecar. Solutions must be found. But remember, VERY few companies get here. Make damn sure you need the networking complexity you are about to take on, because no matter what the vendors/conferences tell you, there will be pain, and nothing comes for free. Is it always going to be this way? I don't think so. I actually think we are in a bridge period in which the average engineer has to directly interact with technologies like Envoy and K8S to succeed at SoA. I am a firm believer that in the 10 year timeframe, FaaS is all anyone will interact with. If I am a developer I want to provide code that: - R/Ws from the DB - Calls APIs - Queues/deques jobs That's about it. Everything else is noise. In that vein, I think that in a ☁️ FaaS world that is stable enough to run Google, technologies like K8S, Envoy, \"service meshes,\" etc. will be everywhere, but almost no one will know they are there. It's all plumbing. No one cares about plumbing. Until that day comes, a large scale SoA *will* require implementing a \"service mesh,\" one way or the other.

This is DEEP in the weeds, but worth it. Let's go. 2. So Jeff Smith owns a \"video sweepstakes\" business in Bladen County, which is apparently a place you an go and win money for playing video games. The head of the Bladen County GOP, Landon Bordeaux, goes to Smith and says that he's about to get raided by the current sheriff. 3. But Bordeaux says, there's an out. If Jim McVicker wins the 2014 election for sheriff, Smith will be in the clear. Bordeaux asks Smith to give McCrae Dowless $4000 IN CASH to help McVicker win. So Smith does it. And it works. McVicker wins by 350 votes! 4. But Smith gets stabbed in the back. McVicker raids his video-sweepstakes operation BACKED UP BY HELICOPTERS. Smith is pissed. 5. But apparently Smith does not blame McCrae Dowless, who, after all, did what he what he was supposed to do (If you overlook breaking N Carolina law) Smith agrees to let McCrae Dowless use an empty office in a building Smith owns to run his absentee ballot operation for Harris standby have to take a phone call 6. OK, I'm back. So anyway everything is going swimmingly between McCrae Dowless and Smith until Smith finds out that McCrae Dowless isn't just running his (probably illegal) absentee ballot operation for Harris -- he's also helping Smith's arch nemesis McVicker! 7. This is apparently when Smith and McCrae Dowless become \"former friends.\" So when the current controversy erupts, Smith is more than happy to dime out McCrae Dowless to the Washington Post. Shows them the desk where Dowless sat and recieved the absentee ballots from his crew 8. Smith basically describes a whole bunch of illegal conduct by McCrae Dowless in fairly devastating fashion Well, someone (I don't know who, but maybe McCrae Dowless) wasn't happy about that Today, an even more devastating story emerged on Smith 9. The story on Smith involves a meeting that occurred during the 2018 primary. Smith was supporting Billy Ward in the GOP Primary to oust McVicker. At this point, he's not working WITH McCrae Dowless, he's on his own now At some point he attended a meeting &amp; left behind NOTES 10. So today, one day after Smith dimed out McCrae Dowless to the Washington Post, these notes, written by Smith, make their way into the hands of a North Carolina reporter And they show Smith cooking up a scheme to pay CASH for UNSEALED ABSENTEE BALLOTS https://t.co/lNSfk7ZLzT 11. Smith was clearly desperate to oust McVicker. But he's not as good at rigging absentee ballots as McCrae Dowless. McVicker defeated his opponent and is still sheriff. Where is goes from here -- I have no idea. A lot of the details in this story come from a great New Yorker article that came out a couple hours ago so, I also recommend reading that: https://t.co/rIr1JPwlwa","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"15464697"},"id_str":"15464697","name":"Judd Legum","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"354257"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1237"},"created_at":"Thu Jul 17 05:37:26 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"53282"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"13"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"12796"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"37957"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"984"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"2920"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.3559"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Surprise","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Surprise","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Surprise","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

We're closely supported by @Shieldmaid8 &amp; @GuitarMoog. With growing support for a people's vote, I'd like to explain why it must be a @FinalSayForAll 1/ In the 2016 referendum #The5Million most directly affected were excluded from voting. This must not be allowed to happen again in any new vote that has such a direct impact on our lives. 2/ Let's first remind ourselves why it was decided to exclude #The5Million. EU27 in the UK were excluded on the grounds of citizenship. UK in the EU for 15+ years, were excluded on the grounds of residency. 3/ While it may be acceptable to decide the franchise based on one of these, to use both reasons to exclude a total of 5 million people isn't acceptable in a democracy. 4/ I've often been told that to include one or, ideally, both of these groups in the franchise would be \"moving the goalposts\". There are several reasons why I don't agree with that premise 5/ The people's vote is NOT a re-run of the 2016 referendum, but a NEW vote based on a NEW set of facts and circumstances. Therefore, it's not necessary to keep the same old franchise as the 2016 opinion poll 6/ In fact, it is impossible to keep the same franchise, as it has already changed. Some ppl have sadly died, many others have reached voting age since 23.06.16. A franchise is as dynamic as democracy and the will of the people. If the latter can change, then so can the franchise 7/ Of all the promises made &amp; reneged upon, one promise was made by BOTH the leave and remain campaigns: that EU27 in UK &amp; UK in EU would keep the exact same rights. Thus, no one voted for them to lose any rights. The goalposts were not only moved, they were removed altogether 8/ The argument that only UK citizens should have a say in this UK matter is entirely negated by the fact that Commonwealth citizens and citizens of Cyprus and Malta were able to vote. I don't begrudge anyone their vote, but I demand the same right. 9/ Leavers have called the EU a 'dictatorship' and argue that the UK referendum was democratic. Yet, ironically, there was no democracy in the UK for the #The5Million who are being dictated to by a gov that we can't hold to account 10/ Alongside the colleagues already mentioned, the FSFA Foundation has a group of dedicated volunteers who give their time &amp; expertise to help us reach our goal. Together we've organised many events &amp; are currently organising more. See @FinalSayForAll for more info. 11/ We're currently updating our website https://t.co/Ao4uJ0DkIs to include more about our more recent activities, but please visit it to find out more about what we do &amp; perhaps you may wish to make a donation to help us with our current #BrexitIsPersonal project 12/ So my fellow remainers, campaigners and activists, when you demand a people's vote, please demand a people's vote for ALL. To include #The5Million in a #FinalSayForAll would only enhance democracy. Especially poignant in the year in which we celebrate 100 years of suffrage 13/","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"566278892"},"id_str":"566278892","name":"Bloke From Barnsley #FSFA #The5Million","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"14970"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"9904"},"created_at":"Sun Apr 29 13:05:47 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"181028"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"13"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"923"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1789"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"71"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"138"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.83574"},"all_hashtags":["The5Million","BrexitIsPersonal","FinalSayForAll"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_presente":["Surprise","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

We were all stupid and ignorant before whitey came along. A thread. This is Chimalma. Goddess and mother. Note the boobs. We knew women had female anatomy before Europeans came and told us. Surprised? There’s more. https://t.co/PF8IT6uaOy Ix Chel. Goddess of midwifery and medicine. She was associated with a fertitlity. We knew where babies came from! Amazing! Ix Chel had her own island. When the Spanish arrived they called it Isla Mujeres (Isle of Women) because of all the female statues. https://t.co/72Ng37q09p This is pre colombian Mexican figurine. If you look closely you will see a penis. We knew what penises were! We knew what they were for! We didn’t make the mistake of putting them on sculptures of Chimalma, Ix Chel or Chalchiuhtlicue! https://t.co/qEtgDvYLg4 This is Chalchiuhtlicue, goddess of fertility and female power among other things. We associated fertility with females. This might be hard for some to believe, but this happened before the conquest. We managed to reproduce without being told how. https://t.co/EhRadtBlRV TEMIXIHUITIANI is a hard word to pronounce. \"Partera\" in Spanish is easier. It means midwife. People knew about babies and birth before the arrival of European boats. Unbelievable. How could we possibly understand before we were exposed to white ideas? It’s a mystery. This is a Cihuateteto, the malevolent spirit of a woman who died in childbirth. They are from Cihuatlampa, otherwise known as the place of women. Childbirth was considered a battle because it was really hard. https://t.co/fJPfQhPTJP All Cihuateteto were female because we knew that… drumroll… men didn’t die in childbirth. I could do this all day. But it might be easier just to call out TRAs on their patronising racism. If you believe that biology is a social construct, build your argument. Stop using other cultures to prop up your adolescent, self-absorbed ideology. I can’t think of anything more white and colonial than imposing ideologies on others. We got Catholicism and that was enough, thanks. Trying to make non-European cultures appear ignorant about the fundamental truths of life on the planet is simple white supremacy. We have our own third gender. Muxes are accepted and treated as what they are. Muxes. Not actual females to be recognized as such in law. To be a Muxe you have to be male. We have managed to accept that, all without European help. You use black women as a subsection to compare with biological males. You manipulate the traditions of other cultures to justify self-id. You question the biology you yourself are reliant on for life and then point at us as though we’re here to back you up. Get an argument. Build an objective point of view that doesn’t have to prop itself up on the lives and cultures of others. And if you can’t, accept that what you hold is an ideology. Your belief is your own. It is not ours. We have been colonized enough.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"1067486060970598400"},"id_str":"1067486060970598400","name":"therestofus","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"1214"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"305"},"created_at":"Tue Nov 27 18:31:24 +0000 2018","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"2472"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"13"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1642"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"8848"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"126"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"681"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.88492"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

Those are not paperweights on the roof. I am not a solar-power hater. I am something much worse. I am a Green who can do math. (!) https://t.co/DoE2dvvYMB 2/ Solar power faces a series of daunting technical challenges: First, high solar intensity. The enemies of intensity are humidity, low altitude, high latitude, and slope. 3/ Solar intensity is much higher at elevation, humidity generates light reflecting haze/clouds, high latitudes introduce massive seasonal variation, and slope vastly reduces area available for panels. 4/ The red zones are the only places where solar intensity is sufficiently high for panels to make economic sense without massive subsidies. The red and orange are the locations where it makes environmental sense. https://t.co/qqPOTAdvf0 5/ Second, proximity. Transmitting power more than about 500 miles means a load loss of ~10%. The dots on the map represents cities. If the dots aren’t close to a red zone, transmission lost kills solar as a useful input. https://t.co/fn8so64Amb 6/ Third, intermittency. Between haze/clouds, seasons, and night, solar is unreliable - and we all need on-demand power. In most locations the sun shines during periods of low power demand, while high power demand occurs after sunset. 7/ Lithium is often floated as a storage mechanism, but it does not charge or discharge fast enough, nor does it store enough electricity. 8/ Lithium paired with solar in the green areas actually increases your carbon footprint because you will never generate sufficient electricity to overcome the sunk carbon cost of producing the system in the first place. 9/ That leaves most people with a fourth problem: fuel pairing. Since a coal plant takes a full day to spin up and down, it never turns off even when the sun is out. 😠 10/ The great lie of green power is that it counts any solar-generated electricity as part of the mix, even if we don’t use that electricity due to low momentary demand, or if we never turn off our coal power plant. 😳 11/ In the German and Chinese cases specifically, the paired fuel is typically soft coal or lignite, so in most cases their carbon emissions have gone UP because of their solar commitments. (Btw, pairing w hydro is great if your geography allows it) 12/ Collectively, this means that unless you are in the red zones AND between the dotted lines on this graphic, solar is at most a fringe contributor to your power needs. And if you are in the green zones solar actually makes your net emissions worse. https://t.co/M4dDb4NsPy 13/ which means we have a very long way to go if the goal is actually to eliminate carbon emmissions. The green technologies we have today just cannot do it. In fact most of them in most places actually make the situation worse. 😕 https://t.co/xq2MQXBTw3 14/ For some details on what DOES work and where, as well as some ideas on how to reduce American greenhouse gas emissions NOW for a net cost of ZERO, see the Absent Superpower P389-402. 🤓 Ok.

JWR confirmed she was not directed by the PM or his government to enter into a DPA agreement. JWR confirmed nothing illegal occurred. Some facts that contradict JWR narrative.... 1/X 2.Lead prosecutor recommended the use of the DPA tool. The Director of Prosecutions overturned the decision. JWR confirmed prosecution. JWR did not document her legal analysis supporting the rejection of the DPA. JWR contention that due diligence was exercised was not documented 3/X Given public interest/importance of high profile cases &amp; associated risks, JWR appeared to treat this case in a routine manner. SNC Lavalin, 2nd largest engineering firm in the world with over 60,000 employees and $12 Billlion in world revenues, would be offered a DPA if 4/X in any other 5 eyes country (UK, France, Australia and US). SNC Lavalin has requested a judicial review of the decision not to negotiate a DPA. It appears that JWR prefers prosecutions over DPAs in principle. The suggestion of bringing in an external legal expert to review 5/X the applicability of the DPA option that was rejected was completely valid given there is no expertise on DPAs within the Ministry of Justice since it is a new tool/law in Canada. JWR appeared to take offence at the idea that someone would be more qualified to review the case 6 than her yet she only had 4 years of experience working in the Vancouver DTES Office (drug crimes etc) as a junior prosecutor, in addition to her role within the BC FN Org. It is my contention that JWR &amp; PMO overestimated her legal acumen, communication, mgmt &amp; political skills 7/X JWR is a Rookie Politician/Minister. Besides having 4 chiefs of staff in 3 years, poor performance per political rivals &amp; the legal profession, JWR's conduct &amp; motivations are at question given indications that she was rigid, myopic, stubborn &amp; not a team player. 8/X JWR failed to report any ethical violations to the Ethics Commissioner over a 4 month period which involved discussions in mid Sept, mid Oct and mid December. She contends that she felt inappropriate pressure that mounted and in December is when she felt the most pressure. 9/X Yet, JWR only spoke about pressure to PM Trudeau on Sept 17th &amp; January 7th when she was told about the cabinet shuffle. JWR did not report this inappropriate pressure in Dec or offer her resignation at any point in accordance with cabinet convention. 10/X JWR accepted a new cabinet post January 14th after being advised of the shuffle on January 7th; thereby proving JWR had confidence in the PM, PMO &amp; cabinet. Again, this is in contravention to her claim, after the fact, that she was subject to inappropriate pressure. 11/X JWR had the option to resign and did not do so in accordance with the common law convention called the Shawcross Doctrine. No judgement or decisions should be made until the Ethics Commissioner reviews the case. 12/X Also, the results of the judicial review of the SNC Lavalin DPA denial should be considered since there may have been malicious prosecutorial action on the part of the Crown. 13/X It seems obvious now that the PM/PMO/PCO lost confidence in JWR over a period of time (pre SNCL) for the reasons noted above. Intransigence, entitlement &amp; political nativity make for difficult relationships. * 13/X Spelling correction: naivety. Just a word of thanks to everyone for the retweets &amp; kind words.

For the NHS, there is no contingency plan for “No Deal” that won’t stop people dying. /thread https://t.co/ryrQtuFQ7M Firstly, here is my attempt to understand WTO rules and what happens to us if we leave on no deal: https://t.co/0W6KSzdpMf I’ll wait. 2/ The NHS, long before Brexit, from your govt &amp; your mate Jeremy, is in poor shape. - We don’t have enough staff (100,000 short total, 40,000 nurses, 10,000 doctors) - we don’t have enough funding (~£26b) - Demand continues to rise by 4% every year https://t.co/ThgpqHzKaS 3/ All the NHS alarms are blinking red: - Worst A&amp;E waiting times on record - Longest ever operation wait on record - Worst ever cancer referral wait on record - GP numbers falling - Nursing numbers falling - Deficit at est £6b (£500m surplus 2010) https://t.co/Sf51MdezjK 4/ This isn’t just inconvenient, the stakes are human lives. - Nursing numbers/patient are vital to surviving illness - 120,000 deaths in U.K. since 2015 due to NHS cuts https://t.co/rvs46HF9x6 5/ It feels insane to have to say this as “background” but in healthcare money really MATTERS. Like “Gran won’t be with us for Christmas” matters. 6/ To No Deal. Firstly May’s proposed NHS funding boost was linked to a “Brexit dividend”. There is no “dividend”. https://t.co/dGQnXrJlfm Your govt themselves est No Deal will cost 8% GDP over 15 years- that’s £159b. Thats the entire NHS AND schools budget combined. 7/ So money will be tighter. So will staffing levels. Post Brexit EU nursing applications fell by 96%. Currently there are 55,000 EU NHS. No Deal will mean these citizens have no legal basis to work or live or receive pensions here. We cannot afford to lose any more staff 8/ Other parts of our NHS are tied up in the EU: - The European Medicines Agency approves drugs. With no deal we will have to approve our own, a long &amp; costly process. - Drug companies will de-prioritise the U.K. for new medicines, like new cancer drugs. https://t.co/prYn4Uu961 9/ We also import a lot of medicines. Leaving the EMA and customs union without a licensing agreement will stall future medicine imports for months if not years. 10/ EURATOM monitors, stores &amp; transports nuclear material. We use these for diagnostics including cancer, heart disease &amp; treatments for thyroid &amp; bone diseases. With No Deal we don’t have a solution to do this ourselves: scans and even cancer treatments will stall until we do. 11/ Horizon 2020 is a £500m European research initiative, funding cutting edge research in the U.K. Since Brexit these projects are no liable for funding beyond 2020. With No Deal they cease entirely before then. https://t.co/d8N09eBoX4 12/ Lastly health isn’t just determined by the resources available to treat disease, preventing is just as if not more important. - Further social care cuts precipitate worsening mental and physical health - Economic hardship worsens mental and physical health 13/ A No Deal Brexit will have a massive knock on effect on the nation’s health and it’s healthcare. People will die as a direct consequence of this decision. And that is on your government @MattHancock , contingency or otherwise. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2659372678"},"id_str":"2659372678","name":"Dr Dominic Pimenta","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"9617"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"609"},"created_at":"Tue Jul 01 09:02:36 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"21640"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"14"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1317"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1879"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"94"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"134"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.05224"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Disgust"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

Bc he lied and bc we all know he DID conspire with Guccifer (confirmed to be RU military intelligence, GRU) et al. https://t.co/XrRKCorED4 2. On Aug. 4, 2016 Stone sent an email to Nunberg and said \"I dined with Julian Assange last night,\". The WSJ has a copy of hte email. Now the gaslighting nutjob liar is saying \"The email means nothing bc I didn't go\". Good luck with that. 3. Stone is all \"I never dined with Assange, the email doesn't have any significance. This was said in jest\" Sure, Jan. Explain that to Mueller. 4. Kindly note: Mueller's team has asked about Stone's email during testimony before a Grand Jury. This means the matter is dead serious. 5. I find it highly unlikely that Mueller would waste the GJ time with suggestions about an email problem unless he believed the claim had merit. So yeah, not buying it. And also, the below. LOL. https://t.co/ILQ9SXVa2I 6. And let's not forget Stone has been widely inconsistent in his statements about WIkiLeaks and Assange. Not to mention the day after the dinner he is laughably trying to deny, Stone tweeted: \"Hillary lies about RU involvement in DNC hack - Julian Assange is a hero\". 7. THREE DAYS after that, Stone told a GOP group in Florida that he had communicated with ASsange, and that he believed more damaging docs about HRC would be released in months to come. \"There's no telling what the Oct. Surprise may be. But hey, no meeting. 8. Mind you, even if Stone only had a Skype tete à tete with Assange, instead of dinner in person, it's not like that would put him in a better position. It appears evident he communicated with Assange, and we KNOW he did with Russian GRU Guccifer. 9. The point here is cooperation or rather conspiracy between Trump Associates and Russia. Kind reminder that WIkileaks even per Trump lackey and Putin stooge POMPEO is nothing but a Kremlin front. 10. So whether Stone went to dine with Assange in person, used Whatsapp to chat, Skype or whatever else, the result is the exact same. That's cooperation and conspiracy with the Kremlin to spread stolen material in order to influence the election. 11. Days before Stone's claim to have dined with Assange, the WSJ notes, Trump himself called upon Russia to steal and release Clinton's emails (there, I fixed it for you WSJ). 12. Stone is all \"I neeevah evah talked about Wikileaks disclosures with Trump!\". That's right, bozo, you discussed the strategy to release them and how to get them, not the disclosure per se. 13. Another kind reminder that Stone is so foolish as to have posted screenshots of Twitter DMs he exchanged with Guccifer, meaning the GRU.

Gordon Liddy, who helped devise the plan, called Operation Intercept an \"exercise in international extortion.\" The goal was to pressure Mexican officials into cooperating with the U.S. /6 Here is Liddy: \"The Mexicans, using diplomatic language of course, told us to go piss up a rope. The Nixon administration didn't believe in the United States' taking crap from any foreign government.

One was Justin Kennedy, the son of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Another was Mike Offit. Mike was the 1st lender. He was fired in 99. https://t.co/sBnyCMVaS5 Everything Trump touches does @TheRickWilson have Over the next few years, the commercial real estate group, with Mr. Kennedy (Justice Kennedy's son) now in a senior role, kept lending to Trump In 2003, a Deutsche Bank team led by Richard Byrne — a former casino-industry analyst who had known Mr. Trump since the 1980s — was hired to sell bonds on behalf of Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts The so-called roadshow seemed to go well. At every stop, Trump was greeted by large audiences of fund managers, executives and lower-level employees. The problem, was that few of them were willing to entrust money to him. Trump requested an audience with the bank’s bond salesmen. Trump gave a pep talk. “Fellas, I know this isn’t the easiest thing you’ve had to sell, But if you get this done, you’ll all be my guests at Mar-a-Lago,” Sorry @TheRickWilson #EverythingTrumpTouchesDies The sales team managed to sell hundreds of millions of $ worth of bonds.Trump was pleased with the results. “Don’t forget what you promised our guys,” an exec reminded him. Trump said he did not remember 😒 “That’s all they’ve talked about the past week,” the exec replied. Trump ultimately flew about 15 salesmen to Florida on his Boeing 727. They spent a weekend golfing with Trump A year later, in 2004, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts defaulted on the bonds. Deutsche Bank’s clients suffered steep losses. This arm of the investment-banking division stopped doing business with Trump. Around that time, Trump returned to the Bank’s commercial real estate unit for another loan. This one was to build a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower. As Deutsche Bank considered making the loan, Trump wooed bankers with flights on his private plane. In a Trump Tower meeting, he told Mr. Kennedy that his daughter Ivanka would be in charge 😒pimping out Ivanka. Trump told Bank his net worth was about $3B, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, and a sr investment-banking exec said in that he and others cautioned that Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.😳 Nonetheless, Deutsche Bank agreed in 2005 to lend Trump more than $500M for the project. He personally guaranteed $40M of it meaning the bank could come after his personal assets if he defaulted They sued each other. With the suits in court sr invest-bank execs severed ties. Trump expressed interest in another loan from the private-banking division: $48M for the same Chicago property that had provoked the two-year court fight. Trump told the bank he would use that loan to repay what he still owed the investment-banking division. Even by Wall Street standards, borrowing money from one part of a bank to pay off a loan from another was an extraordinary act of financial chutzpah. Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Bowers tentatively agreed to both loans. 😵 Ms. Vrablic’s relationship with the Trumps deepened. Deutsche Bank lent money to Donald Trump Jr. for a South Carolina manufacturing venture that would soon go bankrupt. It provided a $15 million credit line to Kushner and his mother. The bank previously had an informal ban on business with the Kushners because Jared’s father, Charles, was a felon. 😖 In all, Ms. Vrablic had loaned Trump $300M, knowing he was a bad bet. He asked for more money for Turnberry during the campaign. They finally said no. And here we are, in the midst of quite a few investigations.

Worse, the institutions that are meant to remedy misperceptions, from universities to news outlets, may actually make them worse. Me @TheAtlantic [Short Thread.] https://t.co/hVlULVdGkZ American politics is defined by negative partisanship: not by whom we like, but by whom we hate. So... why do we hate the other side so much? According to a new study by @MiC_Global, a big part of the reason is that we falsely ascribe extreme opinions to our adversaries. Take Republicans: * Republicans believe that only half of Democrats are “proud to be American.” Actually, 8 out of 10 are. * Republicans also believe that only 3 in 10 Democrats oppose open borders. Actually, 7 in 10 do. https://t.co/j1zdT0Ovxg Or take Democrats: * Democrats believe that only half of Republicans favor \"properly controlled\" immigration. Actually, 8 out of 10 do. * Democrats also believe that only half of Republicans believe that racism still exists. Actually, 8 out of 10 do. https://t.co/AcNDPZ1eM1 Is America’s partisan divide due to ignorance? And, if so, might education or exposure to political news fix the problem? Depressingly, the data implies the opposite: The more Americans know, and the fancier their degree, the more they are likely to caricature their opponents. With the exception of the old broadcasting networks, consumption of virtually any forms of news – the NYT or the WSJ, Daily Kos or Breitbart – increases what the study calls The Perception Gap. https://t.co/YTz8Rhnlyf Media only helps to narrow the perception gap when its partisan lean goes against the inclination of the consumer: So if Republicans watch CNN, or Democrats watch Fox, their perception gap slightly narrows. Just about everything else makes things worse. https://t.co/jaqjkbqTJO Do universities fare any better? Sadly not. Far from learning more about their ideological adversaries, Democrats who are highly educated are way more likely to hold caricatural views about Republicans than Democrats who only have a high school degree https://t.co/kisgjtgmEv Interestingly, the same dynamic does not hold for Republicans. Republicans who dropped out of high school, for example, have a bigger perception gap than those with a postgraduate degree. Why does education increase the perception gap for Democrats but not Republicans? Likely answer: Highly-educated Republicans tend to be exposed to lots of liberals. Highly-educated Democrats tend to have an ideologically homogeneous friend group. https://t.co/QPQzyD6pNE To be clear, then, this study does not measure the direct impact of education or news consumption on the perception gap. But it does suggest that these institutions are, at best, highly ineffective in attenuating it (and may, at worst, actively compound it). My takeaway? It is deeply worrying that Americans now have so little understanding of their political adversaries. It is downright disturbing that the very institutions that ought to help us become better informed may actually be deepening our mutual incomprehension. [End.] Also, check out the cool website for the report - and take a quiz to see how far you are off! - here: https://t.co/r09NJZXvKN Finally, this study neither argues nor assumes that each side's positions are morally equivalent. But even if you strongly prefer the views of one side, as I do, you should be worried about our tendency to caricature the positions of the other side.

There are more \"unknown unknowns\" than \"known unknowns\". More like a quantum problem. A telco gets a massive fine for an infraction. Everything changes for that telco and it affects other countries where the telco is operating. You as a business person working with them in Uganda or Zambia probably didn't understand how an NCC fine in Nigeria could affect you. Right now, there is an Ebola outbreak in Congo, we still don't see yet how it is going to affect the perception of Africans globally and probably ruin business. The last time there was an outbreak in West Africa, it effectively ended our partnership with a major payments company. There was no Ebola risk in Ghana but I was Nigerian running a business that had West Africans who were supposed to go for training in South Africa to run something for banks in Rwanda. They kept delaying the training until someone told me the real reason. A black person inside. The company would never admit it openly but they had an embargo on travel to West Africa. Rwanda was also strict about visits of people from countries where Ebola was reported. They just couldn't take the risk. Funny thing is that I understood. I wasn't bitter. It is what it is The little African uncertainties that we think don't matter have a massive impact on everything else around the continent and beyond. Like the butterfly effect. All African ambiguity is interpreted negatively. African problems are magnified much more than successes. The problem is that those \"little\" ambiguities and major uncertainties are also our reality. We can't sweep them under the carpet and pretend that they don't exist. To address them, we must know them. It is important that they are transparently visible to address root causes. I have been thinking deeply of a way to map African problems and African solutions. We have a lopsided discovery problem with the positive and an equally skewed narrative problem with the negative. Colonial fragmentation and selfish politics has also not helped matters. People make money from false narratives of the positives as well as negatives. Fact is as rare as a Unicorn in Africa. We have a situation where \"Africa as a Paycheck\" is a more realistic business model for a lot of people than really getting to the bottom of African realities Someone mentioned here yesterday (I think it is @immariawohan) that all data tells a story but it depends on who is telling the story. The person's motives and biases typically taints the narrative. Maybe it is time to just have only the data raw and unfiltered? The quantum problem in Africa is knowing what data to collect and where to get it from. Data collection in Africa is also expensive. I believe there are two major \"sources\" of information and \"tools\" that need to be tapped into now. Mobile and young people. I believe every young person in Africa with a phone is like part of the Mechanical Turk data gathering mechanism for a massive machine learning model. They have working sensors with them to capture data for an African learning model. I would trust machines more than people to reveal the truths about Africa. Maybe it is time for us to build our own African version of Palantir. I believe that if we see African mega trends earlier at a macro level, we can solve local problems better. All current solutions are just part of the learning model. The best way to break out of the colonial matrix of \"unknown unknowns\" is to create more \"known knowns\".","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"5404442"},"id_str":"5404442","name":"Victor Asemota","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"44861"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"6655"},"created_at":"Sun Apr 22 15:47:43 +0000 2007","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"157314"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"14"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"35"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"100"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.96448"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

Absolutely zero Collusion, conspiracy or coordination with Russia to interfere in the election.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"982675379319132160"},"id_str":"982675379319132160","name":"Undercover Huber","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"78357"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"99"},"created_at":"Sat Apr 07 17:44:02 +0000 2018","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"6371"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"14"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4717"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"14919"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"337"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1066"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.63136"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Disgust","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

He's creating revenue -- at least $1.6M so far, for his own private businesses. Some of that $ came from the GOP. Some of it came from...you. https://t.co/CLtJlLf4Ga A little more about this story... I think of our coverage of @realdonaldtrump’s busines in terms of three I’s: Influence, income, immigration. Each is a piece of a larger moral story – how is @realdonaldTrump balancing his old private business w/ his new, vast public trust? Today, it's Income. The most basic question about income and @realdonaldtrump. Is he using the presidency to make $ for himself? We started w/ @pbump's list of Trump's trips to his own properties. We compared it to data from @PropOTP (showing federal spending at Trump properties) and the FEC (showing campaign spending at Trump properties). Did Trump visits coincide with $ coming in? https://t.co/jUuGUlW2NZ https://t.co/VLoIlcvK8a Look at April 2017. @realDonaldTrump had a summit meeting w/Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. He didn't come alone. 24 White House staffers got taxpayer-funded rooms at Mar-a-Lago, at $546 a night. https://t.co/6a5gEEyI0l Sec. of State Rex Tillerson, for instance, got Mar-a-Lago's \"Adam Suite,\" complete with the ultimate in luxury: a land-line telephone in the bathroom. https://t.co/O1FbEv0pVb But taxpayers didn't just pay @realDonaldTrump for these rooms. Also -- as first reported by @propublica -- taxpayers paid Trump for a drinking session his staffers held in Mar-a-Lago's \"Cloister Bar.\" 54 shots of hard alcohol. https://t.co/vWiybWt4Kw I circled the \"service charge\" there. Mar-a-Lago added it to the bill, even though there hadn't actually *been* any service. White House staffers kicked out the bartender and served themselves. Then Trump's club sent Trump's govt the bill. https://t.co/S98HfKxBnP In all, the government paid @realdonaldtrump’s club at least $30K that weekend, to host a summit that Trump himself set up. He had made himself the president, the customer, and the innkeeper. Taxpayers paid the bills. (Trump Org says they don’t charge enough to make a profit). Another way Trump's visits translate into $ for Trump Org: political fundraisers. GOPers want @realdonaldtrump as a headliner. So where he goes, they go --paying Trumps clubs to rent Trump's ballrooms to hear Trump speak. Here's one payment for a single Mar-a-Lago fundraiser. https://t.co/Jc7uMXfhlv I’d wanted to understand the moral calculations made here by Trump Org: why charge the government at all, for visits that are Trump's own choice? We sent questions. No answers yet. https://t.co/UPHfgRXneo Also would love to hear from President Trump, about the moral calculations he's made here. If anybody knows his Twitter handle, let me know!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e81840f1"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"211"},"texto":"1. Is there any reason for hope? I suggest there is. I want to return to Tuesday’s court hearing. Trump’s lawyer argued that Congress cannot issue subpoenas to investigate presidential violations of the law. Judge Mehta plainly and inarguably disagreed with that position. . . 2. Without recounting every observation by Judge Mehta, he made it crystal clear that it’s proper, indeed necessary, for Congress to investigate presidential violations of statutes, presidential violations of the Constitution (the judge specifically mentioned . . . 3. the emoluments clause) and presidential conflicts of interest (the judge referenced a president having a financial interest in the legislation he supports or other actions he takes while in office). Indeed, it was so obvious that Judge Mehta would rule . . . 4. against Trump’s position &amp; in favor of the House Oversight Committe’s position that, at the end of the hearing, Trump’s lawyer said as much (asking the judge to stay/delay his order from taking effect until Trump’s lawyer could appeal the ruling he expected to go against him). 5. Just yesterday, the White House Counsel issued a letter essentially taking the same (losing) position that Trump’s lawyers took in court on Tuesday. Why do I interpret this as a hopeful sign? Because, IMO, the state of our judiciary remains strong. Notwithstanding . . . 6. the administration’s obvious stonewalling, these matters will move into and be resolved by the courts. After 30 years, appearing before more than 100 judges, I firmly believe that our judiciary remains dedicated to the rule of law. Even more importantly . . . 7. the judiciary will not endure or endorse a criminal president or a corrupt administration. Now, we’re rightly concerned about the packing of the courts with conservative judges. But every conservative administration appoints conservative judges, so this is nothing new . . . 8. With the black robe and life tenure comes great independence. Yes, these conservative judges likely will remain ideologically conservative. But that does not mean they will side with a criminal president or a corrupt administration. I don’t want to sound cynical, but . . . 9. The judiciary likes to assert its authority over the executive branch. When both Nixon and Clinton made arguments that suggested a president is above (or beyond the reach of) the law/the judicial system, the Supreme Court shot them down. Put another way . . . 10. The judiciary understand (and jealously guards) its authority and responsibility to remain a vitally important check on lawless behavior by the president and the executive branch. These stonewalling tactics ultimately will fail, with the courts ruling against Trump. . . 11. and in favor of Congressional oversight and investigative authority. When given the opportunity, the courts WILL hold this criminal president accountable. It won’t happen quickly, though I believe the courts will move these matters through the system on an expedited basis... 12. Indeed, Judge Mehta articulated that these matters need to be given ‘most expeditious treatment when one branch of government is holding up the work of another’ (paraphrasing). Judge Mehta exemplified the fidelity to the law that inspires confidence in our judiciary . . . 13. Let’s be real, this battle between a lawless administration and a rule-of-law judiciary will continue for some time. Unfortunately, many of our elected officials in Congress have chosen to side with a lawless president. History will will not treat those politicians kindly... 14. So all of this is to say that it won’t come quickly, it won’t come easily, it won’t come painlessly, but Tuesday’s court hearing is an encouraging sign that #JusticeIsComing","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"1003107003693137921"},"id_str":"1003107003693137921","name":"Glenn Kirschner","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"78522"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"16199"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 03 02:52:01 +0000 2018","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"7249"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"14"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"6538"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"26785"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"467"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1913"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.93963"},"all_hashtags":["JusticeIsComing"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

Yesterday I talked about the \"empathy shock\" or the \"alterity crack\" with @rogerdodger1180 . Today is my daughter's birthday. 2/ I never mention her name or location on social media, I am scared to death that someone will touch her and it hasn't changed much for the past 30 years. I told Roger that I remembered seeing many copies of her, except they were Kurds, when Saddam Hussein attacked them. 3/ All those little dead bodies were copies of my baby and the shock of seeing that was harder than dealing with real children in extreme poverty in the slums of Brazil. I held many. I wasn't a mother yet, though. 4/ Later on, when she was about 7 or 8, we stopped for bathroom and drinks on our way to see my sister. We lived in Blacksburg, VA where I was a visiting scholar and the road crossed the Apalachians. 5/ We stopped at this place where a dozen men wearing hats and women on flowery dresses turned their white heads to look at my brown child. The alarm reactions kicked in instantly. A mother will kill to protect her baby. 6/ When she was about to be born, I threatened the physician. He was trying to get me to accept the common maternity baby room when we had an agreement that I was in the common room program (mother and child in the same room). 7/ He was scared. My daughter's father was scared. Then she was born and they put the crib a few feet from my bed. I forced them to put it right next to it. My baby - my rules. I also remember paranoid thoughts about what to do if somebody tried to steal her. 8/ \"Is it possible to insert a chip in the baby's body so that we can locate her at any time?\" People looked at me a bit scared. This lasted just a couple of days. I didn't let people hold her except my close family. I didn't allow visits during the first month. 9/ Then, during the last Carnaval, the fascist police attacked her party block in Brazil. She was hurt. The policemen were put on leave and the district is being sued. They will lose. Good. But that day and the days that followed, I felt helpless and desperate. 10/ When I see the cages at the South border, all the kids look like my baby to me. Why? No clue. The image of innocent refugee children murder, the little girl with a pink blouse, looks exactly like my baby. I can see her. 11/ That's the alterity shock. The victim is you, or, worse, your child. You need to do something about it. And yes, that also comes with anger, powerlessness and hate: I hate the ICE agents. I know that I wish they were hurt. 12/ I am a good social scientist. The USCIS agreed with this, too: I have the whore-visa.. oops, sorry, the EB-1A visa (the one Melania screwed up for us). I know that the proper definition is \"concentration camp\". 13/ It goes beyond that, though. I will think about my baby the whole day today. It's her birthday. Yesterday was the funeral of a boy who killed himself here in Red America. It was also supposed to be the terrorist ICE raid against immigrant families ordered by Trump. 14/ The empathy shock creates dark thoughts in my mind. I will try to focus on my baby's birthday and on the hope that some day Trump, Nielsen, Miller and their crew will be sitting at the International Court at the Hague answering for crimes against Humanity.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"575723052"},"id_str":"575723052","name":"Marilia Coutinho, Ph.D. , the #BaffledImmigrant","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"2668"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2549"},"created_at":"Wed May 09 20:09:53 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"16190"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"14"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"33"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"136"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"10"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.77756"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Anger","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

His hackers are part of Concord Management, which also includes the Wagner Group that kills reporters and spies on the peaceful #SudanUprising. https://t.co/kfDh7NxK94 Prigozhin is a Russian organized crime boss who began as a pimp and a thief, and graduated to running gambling rackets for Putin in St. Petersburg. He's called Putin's Chef because Concord Management has the catering contracts for the Russian Ministry of Defense. #SudanUprising When I say Prigozhin was a pimp, I mean he was convicted of trafficking a 13-year-old girl. When I say he was a thief, I mean he beat up a woman and stole her coat, shoes, and earrings. Now his Wagner Group provides protection for Sudan's dictator Bashir. #SudanUprising In the U.S., Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted Prigozhin and his Concord Management company (which is a front for Russian organized crime), for using hackers and trolls to help elect Trump. (They also deal in kompromat and blackmail.) #SudanUprising Concord Management is an umbrella organization, through which Russian organized crime boss Prigozhin controls hackers &amp; trolls (such as the Internet Research Agency that boosted Trump) and the Wagner Group (an arm of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU). #SudanUprising People in the U.S. have no idea that Prigozhin, who has been indicted along with his mobbed up Concord Managment in the Trump-Russia investigation, is also running Russian military intelligence operatives (the Wagner Group) to prop up Bashir in Sudan. #SudanUprising Former Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer Dmitry Utkin founded the Wagner Group, financed and controlled by Prigozhin as part of the organized crime front known as Concord Management. Prigozhin named Utkin to Concord Management's board of directors. #SudanUprising Utkin recruited Ukrainian soldiers and sailors to work for the Wagner Group in Sudan, in exchange for Russian citizenship. They arrive in Khartoum on Russian military planes, which park by the VIP terminal. These paramilitary forces spy on peaceful protestors. #SudanUprising The Wagner Group also guards Sudan's gold mines, diamond mines, and uranium mines, as well as the atomic energy facilities which Russia is building in Sudan. Bashir has given Prigozhin and the Wagner Group ownership interests in Sudan's mines. #SudanUprising On paper, it initially appears that Sudanese companies own the gold, diamond, and uranium mines in Sudan. But when you investigate, you find that the Sudanese companies are actually owned and controlled by Prigozhin's Russian companies, such as M Invest. #SudanUprising Sudan's dictator Bashir has given the Russian organized crime boss Prigozhin and his Wagner Group thugs the gold, diamond, and uranium mines that represent the natural heritage of Sudan's youth. And Russia is building a military base in Port Sudan. Tasgut bas. #SudanUprising This is Yevgeny Prigozhin. This is the face of Russian colonialism in Sudan. This is the man who owns Bashir. He is actually just what he started out to be -- a pimp and a thief. He is vulnerable. So is the Wagner Group in Sudan. That's why they are hiding. #SudanUprising https://t.co/YdYaErIz3X Prigozhin's Wagner Group of Russian military intelligence operatives used to stroll about Khartoum, buying running shoes at the Shoe Mall, training Sudanese armed forces and police, and driving Russian military trucks. They remain in Sudan but now they are hiding. #SudanUprising Why is Prigozhin's Wagner Group hiding in Sudan? They're afraid. They fear what will happen when the #SudanUprising follows them home from their shopping trips to the Shoe Mall on Abdel Monheim Mohamed Street in Khartoum.

A direct result of all that white flight (which took decades) is that the Democratic Party, as an establishment, is disproportionately black- and woman-powered. Never more so than now. /2 And that influence is probably at its greatest and most visible in the primaries, when the base gets to vote amongst themselves. Meaning, in the primaries, reliable Democratic *voters* are a huge part of the Democratic “establishment”. /3 This is probably a good time to point out that there’s no one The Establishment. There are a lot of establishments, with different amounts and types of power. /4 https://t.co/BOaniax1Mz Trump is a great example. He spent most of his life outside the political establishment. But he’s always been a rich, bigoted, sexist white guy - the country’s oldest and most powerful establishment. /5 So an “anti-establishment” Democrat could run against a lot of things. Like white male supremacy, or corporate deep pockets. At large, or even specifically within the Democratic Party. /6 And if they were sloppy, or racist, or sexist, an anti-establishment candidate could conflate the Corporate Deep Pockets Establishment with the Disproportionately Black and Female Voters Establishment. /7 A conflated “anti-establishment” message like that would resonate heavily with aggrieved white men on the left, and the women who love them. /8 It could also resonate among left-wing voters that are ignorant of or disinterested in the voting power and preferences of black voters in Democratic primaries, and don’t see the conflation. /9 A primary candidate that lost due to black voters could even convince a lot of white people it was The Establishment’s fault. Because when it comes to the Democratic Party, black voters and “The Establishment” are intertwined in a way that’s ignored by a lot of white people. /10 And all of this is a recipe for leveling accusations of “you rigged the system against us” at the people who the system is actually rigged against. You have white men indirectly accusing women of color of voter suppression and election rigging. /11 The most glaring example of this to me was in 2016, when some people accused the DNC of closing polling stations in Arizona to help Hillary. But the stations were actually closed by the GOP, and the Hispanic voters who were disproportionately affected leaned Hillary. /12 These are all potential (inevitable?) pitfalls when populist language like “anti-establishment” gets aimed at the Democratic Party or other major left-wing groups. Not that they’re above reproach. But that conflation will be lurking as long as the left is less white and male. /13 At the end of the day, this isn’t about any one candidate. This is about white people, and men, and our uncanny ability to use ignorance and entitlement to make ourselves out to be the real victims here. /14","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"765124940144123904"},"id_str":"765124940144123904","name":"Ed Overbeek","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"8771"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"6785"},"created_at":"Mon Aug 15 09:56:15 +0000 2016","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"25336"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"14"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"440"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1917"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"31"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"137"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.8161"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

According to my quantitative research it’s right wing bias framing news using capitalist class’s view of economy, capital versus labour. A thread👇🏻 Article for reference here, where Ita is laying groundwork to bring more conservative voices into the ABC. In other words - doing what Murdoch/Liberals have been lobbying for FOR YEARS: https://t.co/9BBjKDvtZ7 I looked at reporting of an industrial dispute - CFA versus UFU in Vic 2016. These results are obvs just one case, but I also looked at five historical disputes and they are generalisable across normal industrial disputes between workers and employer. Here is a breakdown of media reporting by percentage of narrative. Red matches union/Labor narrative, blue matches employer/Liberal narrative. Yes I counted them - this represents thousands of codes. https://t.co/JjdJ2YIwMd As you can see, ABC isn’t the most biased in aligning its narrative with the employer, but it is certainly not biased towards left. The right wing narrative which dominated media framed the union and firefighter members as unreasonable, thuggish, greedy and trying to grab power. I found this employer/Liberal narrative was so close to the Herald Sun/Australian narrative that it was hard to tell where it was born - seamless in its similarity and consistent across both groups. However, I also found this same narrative evident in ABC and Guardian reporting - not biased to the same extent, but it certainly dominated both these outlets and the union/Labor narrative was used far less often (given far less credibility). The reason I used an industrial dispute as a case study is that it provides a generalisable case study to understand framing of political and economic news more broadly. The relationship between workers and capital is the basis of left wing versus right wing politics. You can see similar bias that I found in ABC industrial dispute reporting across much ABC political coverage. It is likely unconscious as Ita so helpfully points out. But it’s there - and it does change the way Australia understands politics. A great example is way ABC reporters mostly write/talk about tax through a negative frame. Framing expert George Lakoff describes the success neoliberal/conservative politicians have had in using the phrase ‘tax relief’ to frame tax as something you are afflicted by - a negative. Here is an article from ABC doing exactly this - framing tax cuts as a ‘relief’ - this is a right wing idea. Yes, this has become a dominant frame, but that nevertheless has a right wing bias. The capital class sees tax as a bad thing, and fight tooth and nail against paying it. https://t.co/NOVG6H1Epr If ABC really did have left wing bias as Ita suggests, tax would be framed as a positive thing. Tax is redistributive. Tax creates government services and spending to benefit the whole society. This is a left wing idea - that tax is positive. Framing it as negative is right wing. So successful have the neoliberals been at framing policies they don’t like as bad for the economy, and perpetuating a myth that left wing governments can’t manage money, these ideas have become rules of thumb, otherwise known as right wing biases. The biases towards the interests of the capital class are subtle, yet important. For instance, interviewing someone losing from franking credits changes, without also interviewing someone gaining from a policy funded by this change is not a balanced report. I have found there is a structural bias across all media - sometimes subtle, sometimes overt - which benefits the views and interests of the capital class over the rest of society. The ABC exhibits such right wing bias. Not all the time. Not every report. But it’s there.

The nature of the ease might surprise, as the BOJ has to overcome the self-imposed constraint of its Yield Curve Control regime, that monstrosity that biases policy to be pro-cyclical. 1/ The background to an ease is fairly simple: inflation is nowhere near Kuroda’s goal of above 2% for a period of time, growth going in the wrong direction, and a likely recession inducing consumption tax hike is set to be enacted in October. 2/ Then there is the added concern of a strengthening JPY amid a more uncertain global economy and a weakening Japanese economy. (The JPY is pro-cyclical, tending to be weak when a strong economy boosts risk appetite and overseas capital outflows). 3/ The case for an ease is compelling, but what form will it take? This is where the constraints of the YCC comes into play. The madness of this policy is that it makes monetary policy pro-cyclical when by definition it is meant to be counter cyclical. 4/ For example, when Japanese growth expectations are strong JGB yields are biased to the top-end of the BOJ’s target band forcing more QE. But when growth expectations dim, JGB yields rally to the point that the BOJ may need to taper/end QE. 5/ We are not far from that point now with 10yr JGBs at -15.5bp, close to the lower-end of the +/- 20bp band. Expanding the monetary base via more JGB purchases without broader changes to the monetary framework is not an option. 6/ https://t.co/A184YCviAM Nor is the growing talk of a 20bp cut to the BOJ’s -0.1% policy rate credible as a stand-alone policy decision. This would steepen the curve, increase the slide on long JGB positions and hence bias JGBs even closer to the lower end of the policy band. 7/ This means that the BOJ’s ease might have to be comprehensive. The path of least resistance is to increase ETF purchases. Talk of capacity constraints seems overdone as the mkt is doing what you would expect: it to - expanding supply to meet demand. 8/ The BOJ owns 64.5% of Japanese equity ETFs and the growth of the market means it is a while before it will encounter binding capacity constraints. However, a broader monetary easing will entail broader changes to the yield curve. 9/ The +/- 20bp volatility band for 10yr JGBs might need to be re-centered or, more optimally, widened, to allow for greater downside potential in yield before QE is forced to end. However, to support the banks the BOJ will want to keep the curve steep. 10/ Hence, the policy rate could also be cut by 20-30bp. This broad policy package is not being talked about – which may simply reflect that it is fanciful. However, it may be a logical path for the BOJ were they to want to inject greater policy stimulus. 11/ Of course, the observation above does not focus on what is optimal. The optimal path is to not raise the consumption tax. The 2014 hike derailed Abenomics just as it was gaining momentum. The current hike will hit an economy already losing momentum. 12/ With around half of JGBs also an asset of the government via the BOJ and with the neural rate close to zero, it’s hard to be concerned with public debt. Combine this with collapsed inflation expectations &amp; Japan is a prime candidate for helicopter money. 13/ However, if the path of orthodoxy is followed there remains the potential for a surprising bold round of policy easing by the BOJ, probably in September but quite possibly in July. 14/ https://t.co/gJ2ioacoj6 As an aside, the inverted world of YCC that creates pro-cyclical monetary policy explains my shock to read the Fed recently praising Japan’s experiment. They were probably just being polite, but then again they also felt the neutral FF rate was 3.0%... 15/","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"594071383"},"id_str":"594071383","name":"Des Supple","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"1421"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"533"},"created_at":"Tue May 29 21:56:19 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"1266"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"6"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"0"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.84584"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Sadness","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

We, the #DigitalSoldiers @GenFlynn spoke about have an opportunity to finally expose the corrupt, fake media fully to those who were unfortunate enough to follow them. Don’t let the MSM get away with their treacherous ways any more. 3. By using your history of videos, memes and photos of the MSM attacking @realDonaldTrump, show the normies how they were misled. Use the facts and truth of the spin they put on every bit of propaganda they pushed. 4. Q will deal with the accountability of Schiff, Comey, HRC and the likes. Part of our job is to help to ‘make the red pill easy to swallow’ as Q put it, so here is a golden opportunity to be kind, compassionate and humble whilst bringing those who are dismayed onboard. 5. WE are the news now, people are lost and looking for answers and truth, even if they feel crushed by Mueller’s report not living up the the hype. ‘You attack those who threaten you most’ Q said.

You can reach out and help heal, build bridges of understanding and truth and make the path easier for those who do not yet understand. The Muller report is one victory, but it is by no means the end of the war. Keep Q, @POTUS and everyone in prayer. 🙏🏻 12. People have received their first shock of MANY still yet to come. Where do you want them to be when the real hard and factual information arrives? With us or refusing to believe anything on the scale they are about to witness, or beside us calling out the corruption...? 13. For perfect harmony, look no further than a choir. It sings with one voice from the same page, not separately and in disunity. T It’s the power of OUR voices drives the narrative and the changes we need to see happen. Every word gives meaning and shape to what we perceive... 14. If you want to make a difference, do it, but do it with the mindset of unity, love, compassion and understanding, not that of hate, division and arrogance. Pray, believe and 💫❤️💫 are the best we can do, but don’t underestimate its power to help and heal... 15.

This right here is the aggressive suppression of investigative journalism, a million times worse than some overpaid news anchor sobbing because Trump hurt his feelings. This right here is \"collusion\" of the worst kind. https://t.co/hkDQ9roKcq Big Tech censorship is the malignant synthesis of campus deplatforming culture and U.S. tech companies working extensively with authoritarian regimes, especially China. They have grown enamored of China's demonstration that information CAN be controlled, given enough power. We're also in the final operational stages of a 15-year war launched by the Left after Rathergate and the rise of the bloggers. They were very determined to neutralize the subversive power of bloggers on the Right and their ability to slip information past the media gatekeepers. Those bloggers were, at the time, confident their voices could not be stifled in the new information age. The Internet opened thousands of doors that could never be closed again. No one would ever be foolish enough to try another scam like Dan Rather's. But China showed it COULD be done. The Internet isn't really a limitless expanse of information that cannot be suppressed or policed for ideology. It has choke points - big platforms that can be controlled by either government censors or a few big companies working together. You don't really have to impose complete silence and rigidly censor every single word to maintain ideological control. You just have to make dissidents shout through cupped hands while giant megaphones are handed to those who toe the ideological line. Remember what happened in Rathergate, when a few intrepid bloggers with relatively limited followings broke a story that blew up into major media coverage? All the Left had to do was figure out how to arrest the \"blowing up\" process. If you broke a Rathergate story today, you would quickly find yourself removed from YouTube, banned from Facebook, demonetized, yanked off popular social platforms. Major media is HEAVILY influenced by social media today. That influence CAN be controlled, and so it is. Dissidents can't be silenced completely, but they can be denied the kind of billion-watt blowtorch influence granted to the preferred left-wing orthodoxy. Speed is vital to the viral spread of information. Big Tech is slowing down the Right while giving the Left the express lane. Your viral Rathergate story might eventually gain some traction after Big Tech stomped on it, but it would happen very slowly. Entire news cycles would pass. Polls could shift and elections could be held before the viral story broke into heavily policed information space. Big Media understands all this. They demand rush treatment and snowballing news coverage for the stories that fit their politics. Reporters spend a lot of time on social media boosting Narrative-friendly stories or even inventing them by stitching a few tweets together. If the media politically approves of your story, it swings from one news hook to another like Spider-Man, never out of the top search results and top news aggregation sites. If it doesn't approve, your story trundles along through the back alleys of information space. So the new censors can't really shut you up entirely, but they CAN slow you down. They can quarantine your information from achieving viral penetration by forcing it to spread more slowly, while the stuff they like spreads with insane speed and few \"content rules\" to worry about. Real journalists, people truly committed to the spirit of free inquiry, would be fighting this tooth and nail. They would understand the SPEED of information is vital. Governments and corporate cabals should not be allowed to slow it down to protect their interests. But instead, Big Media is primarily interested in re-establishing the guild privileges it lost so decisively in the time of Rathergate, concluding a process that began with the dissolution of Big Three network power.

Observers believe this is a JCPOA violation. https://t.co/MGzJNW42yk (Thanks for nothing Obama.) https://t.co/UoMqq01bKw 2) Iran’s missile tests &amp; medium-range ballistic missiles can be considered in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal signed between the P5+1 and Iran. In 2018, Iran has conducted at least seven medium-range ballistic missile tests. 3) Iran has also carried out at least five short-range ballistic and cruise missile tests in 2018 alone. Tehran’s ballistic missile activities are raising int’l concerns. Medium-range ballistic activity is especially worrisome for Middle East countries. 4) Iran has tested at least three variants of the Shahab-3 medium-range missile (L) since the beginning of this year; at least two launches with variants of the Qiam-1 cruise missile (RT) and at least one test launch of the Khorramshahr medium-range missile (RB). (File Photos) https://t.co/moVBOahsUH 5) At least five other tests involved Zolfaghar short-range missiles and a Scud variant missile. Two of the launches involved missions against targets Tehran said were IS in eastern Syria. Combat operations can also serve as missile tests. https://t.co/05I0RYkJqu 6) All of these missiles meet rocket technology criteria for weapons that can be used as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including atomic bombs. The medium-range missiles used can also reach the territory of the south-eastern EU states from Iran. https://t.co/3YUiYbBSYx 7) Medium-range missiles are generally intended for nuclear warheads and thus their formerly low marksmanship. The use of a missile that can hit its target as inaccurately as a medium-range missile only makes sense if it can cause damage on a large scale. https://t.co/e3gO4ianOq 8) Michael Elleman of the British military think tank IISS: \"Iranian nuclear warhead plans submitted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late April 2018 apparently provide for a Shahab-3 launch vehicle.\" Elleman sees them as potential nuclear missiles. https://t.co/ziiDJP4KtA 9) \"About the Khorramshahr, first introduced in 2017, we have little information,\" says Elleman. \"It seems to be based on the North Korean Musudan, which, like its Soviet counterpart, the R-27 submarine missile, is designed to deliver nuclear payloads.” https://t.co/02KxgQBodF 10) For Khorramshahr missiles, one could presumably say they are \"designed for nuclear weapons.” It could well be that the Iranians carried out a great many tests because they wanted to increase the accuracy of their missiles, according to Elleman. 11) \"If you want to hit a smaller, well-protected target - like the Israeli nuclear complex in Dimona - and have no very strong conventional bombs, then you might want to use a very accurate nuclear missile.\" https://t.co/yDZLV7H6pG 12) Iran’s regime also has a history of providing ballistic missiles to Houthi militias in Yemen. https://t.co/myRgF4JXmy 13) “The bottom line is that Iran is facing major domestic and foreign dilemmas, to say the least, and its tactic is to screen one impasse through creating yet another.” https://t.co/TpfK1IYBa8 14) “Various aspects of the dozen hitherto-unknown sites involved in ballistic missile production, testing and launches, all controlled by the IRGC, were also unveiled.” https://t.co/Xiqm9ZOpTm 15) Iranian opposition coalition National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) held an important panel with leading subject-matter experts discussing Iran’s burgeoning missile program and its ties with the nuclear weapons program. https://t.co/3F3OQ3XWCv","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2554131522"},"id_str":"2554131522","name":"Heshmat Alavi","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"34907"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"241"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 08 07:41:33 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"52003"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"351"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"400"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"23"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"27"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.34255"},"all_hashtags":["Iran"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

Trump cronies are incoherently claiming BOTH (a) that the report exonerates him AND (b) the investigation was so ethically compromised and politically biased nothing that came of it can be taken seriously and shouldn't be made public. Obviously can't be both. Trump's \"one weird trick\" is the shameless public delegitimization of anyone aligned against his interests. Once again, we're seeing he's the GOAT at this evil art. It's what's made him the Houdini of industrial-scale white-collar theft. Our idiot media still isn't capable of understanding how to not be co-opted by Trump's reality-bending propaganda machine, and continues to get played like a burgled Stradivarius. Barr's cover-up gambit means Mueller will certainly be called to testify under oath in the House. That's why we're getting the full-on blitz to mischaracterize his findings: to lock the media and public into a favorable narrative nowhere in evidence, before he actually speaks. The Trump machine's rush to assert an adamantly conclusive interpretation of the investigation on nothing but a crony appointee's spin on it, and then using this to discredit the larger attempt to uphold the rule of law and separation of powers is completely poisonous. The media's atrocious gullibility, which is letting this happen without serious resistance, is even more scandalous than the credulity that herded public opinion behind the invasion of Iraq. Because we already *know* this administration does nothing but lie. This Trump campaign memo seeking to de-platform Democrats constitutionally duty-bound to check executive abuses of power, on the basis of claims consistent with Barr's gloss on Mueller's report, gives away the aim of the game: no rule of law, no oversight. https://t.co/jKtPg1isB9 The Trump machine is making a lot of political hay with necessary legal distinctions. Barr says Mueller didn't establish conspiracy or coordination b/w the campaign &amp; \"the Russian government,\" which doesn't imply there wasn't plenty with Russians hard to pin as agents of Putin. He says Mueller didn't establish that any Trump associate or U.S. citizen \"knowingly coordinated\" with the IRA to influence the election. Which doesn't imply that Stone (not part of the campaign) didn't coordinate with anonymous agents of the IRA, or with Assange (not American.) Barr says Mueller supplies evidence of obstruction, then uses the fact that he doesn't establish conspiracy to a certain legal standard (which doesn't at all rule it out, in fact) to argue in a shady way that there was nothing to obstruct, so he let's Trump off scot-free. The Trump admin/campaign then uses it's own opportunistic judgment as a fixed fact to leverage an attack on the legitimacy of Dem oversight officials in Congress. But Congress's constitutional oversight authority is wholly independent of the executive's findings about itself. Trump has gone to pains to confuse people into accepting that the legitimacy of congressional oversight depends on a prior, narrow legal finding of criminality, which it has done everything it can to prevent. Having done it successfully, it's attacking the separation of powers. But congressional power over the executive under the constitution is entirely political. If it decides as a body that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, that settles it. Trump's hand-picked AG (confirmed by a lapdog Senate, with a record of shielding presidents from scandal) telling us what the report says &amp; sitting on it doesn't settle anything. But spinning it like it does to prevent congressional oversight tell us a lot. This is far from over.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"2568461"},"id_str":"2568461","name":"Will Wilkinson 🌐","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"36082"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"5095"},"created_at":"Tue Mar 27 22:38:49 +0000 2007","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"39578"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"21140"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"68714"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1409"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"4581"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.96815"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

I rolled my eyes at almost all talk of ongoing oppression, systemic racism, sexism and misogyny, microagressions, and any hint that speech could = violence. I considered myself a classical liberal /1 The right talks of \"red pill moments,\" in which a person of the left is mugged by reality and becomes rightwing. I prefer the term \"paradigm shift,\" which describes a fundamental change in scientific disciplines. I went through a paradigm shift starting 5 years ago. /2 Teaching at @WabashCollege in Indiana, I spent some time with the students and faculty of the Malcolm X Institute for Black Studies. Learning (and seeing) the experiences of these students in small-town Indiana changed me. /3 Coming from Canada and then Ithaca, NY, it was easy for me to overlook and ignore the oppression other groups faced (though it was still there). But in Indiana, these students were regularly pulled over by cops (I never was), tailed by staff at stores (I never was). /4 They also faced far more blatant acts of racism, like shouts of \"white power\" from passing cars, etc. There is simply no denying that African Americans face this kind of thing day after day after day. That I don't is just the very tip of my white privilege. /5 I began to see the world and myself differently. I saw that I am extraordinarily privileged, that though I do work hard I am starting way ahead of others by being white, upper-middle class, with educated parents, etc. I'm not where I am just because of what I've done. /6 Since meeting the students of @WabashCollege and the MXI, I simply can't be a \"classical liberal\" any more. There simply isn't a level playing field, not in terms of race, educational opportunities, economic resources, etc. To act like there is is cruel and self-serving. /7 Many things have also happened since to change my view of the world (reading Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas, for one...), but in general I now err on the side of not presuming my experience is like others' experiences. I try to default to compassion and self-awareness. /8 To end the confession, perhaps too honestly: Only 5 years ago I might have said \"all lives matter\"; \"not all men\"; \"everything is up for debate\"; \"I'm a free speech absolutist\"; \"students need to be prepared for the real world\". /9 Now I say \"black lives matter\"; \"I believe women\"; \"I don't get to debate the existence of others\"; \"free speech absolutism benefits the already powerful\"; \"marginalised students have already seen more of the real world than I ever will\". That's my paradigm shift. 10/10 Want to add a note calling out Twitter folks who have helped me continue this journey. This is just a start.

Thank you everyone for your kind words and encouragement. Ending the year with a positive Twitter experience is a gift -- and a genuine surprise! Some have said that I don't deserve praise for becoming a decent human being, and that it took me too long to realize these things. I agree. It's not to my credit that I needed to see things with my own eyes to believe systemic oppression exists. Believing what others say would have been FAR better. And, honestly, I am NOT looking for praise. I needed to get this off my chest, but I also genuinely hope that others will take off their blinders too, AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE. All people. Thanks for calling me on it. I want to stress, too, and most importantly, that BIPOCs have been saying these kinds of things and more, over and over, and for years and years.

A link to the full transcript is at the end. It's short, the entire court session only took 10 minutes. That POTUS was under investigation for obstruction of justice obviously isn't new. But *exactly* WHEN that investigation started hasn't been confirmed. This formerly secret \"proffer\" narrows it down to between May 9 (@Comey fired) and May 17 (Mueller appointed as SC) https://t.co/TMx4eRcbA9 My belief is that the obstruction investigation paperwork on POTUS was opened by McCabe on May 10 or 11 2017. Why: because there was already an investigative file open at least before May 12 - which is when Comey gave his memos to the FBI, as covered here: https://t.co/RgZ3jAHe1o Dreeben confirms that Trump was a \"subject\" of the obstruction of justice investigation. That's not new either, but it is curious. If you opened an obstruction case pretty solely based on Comey being fired *by Trump* who *else* could ever be the \"target\" of such an investigation? https://t.co/keIuHpQ4y9 Mueller's report pretty much admits that the entire obstruction investigation was actually into the president's conduct, so it's clear the word games here are to pretend Trump isn't the target and they just want to get his side of the story. https://t.co/1mWJqMHuyI Except, according to Trump lawyer John Dowd (speaking to @ByronYork) - Mueller told him personally on March 5 2018 that the president was a \"witness-slash-subject\" with \"no exposure\" 🚨🤔 https://t.co/14Z1xJqe7h https://t.co/ZQr5UZvpsG But, just a few weeks before agreeing with Dowd that Trump had \"no exposure\", Dreeben made this secret proffer - on behalf of Mueller - just a few weeks earlier on Jan 22 2018... ...where a few things are now clear: a) Trump is *at minimum* a subject, not a mere witness b) Trump's really the *target* c) Trump's the only logical target of an investigation started into his conduct Did Mueller mislead Dowd? 🤔 Remember: Comey was the FBI Director &amp; he knew Trump had asked if he could possibly \"see his way clear\" to \"let go\" Flynn. Comey DID NOT open an obstruction investigation. So the only reason to open one after Comey is fired is: because Comey got fired. And his buddy McCabe did it Oh and if it turns out that McCabe opened that obstruction investigation on May 10 2017, then the later excuse that the FBI did it because of what Trump said to Lester Holt is a lie, because that interview wasn't until May 11. Can someone ask Mueller this if he ever testifies? 🤔 It's also now obvious in retrospect that Rosenstein's appointment order letter to Mueller made specific reference to regulation 20 CFR 600.4 to cover obstruction of justice since it would have been easier just to say all the regulations applied to the Special Counsel https://t.co/dofyEGxGCb Oh &amp; the reason the obstruction investigation starting almost immediately after Comey was fired isn't *new* is because it was leaked to Collusion Media reporters at the Washington Post on June 14 2017. Obviously by either McCabe - or more likely, Mueller's team (who don't leak!) https://t.co/mH3D8IhxaS Finally, the proffer reveals Dreeben's precise role on the Special Counsel (\"Counselor\" to Mueller) and that he was involved at all stages of the investigation. /ENDS https://t.co/5nf5MH9sgV","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"982675379319132160"},"id_str":"982675379319132160","name":"Undercover Huber","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"78357"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"99"},"created_at":"Sat Apr 07 17:44:02 +0000 2018","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"6371"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4975"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"9573"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"332"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"638"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.63136"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

Our tale starts in a northern railway town in 1971 and it looks like a regular story. A 14yo girl called Jacqueline falls in love with a 17yo boy called John, who was from the “wrong part of town.” Read: Poor. Jacqueline’s parents did everything they could think of to keep them apart but it was no use. They proper loved each other. Jacqueline’s mother really hated John. She told Jacqueline he’d “get her pregnant &amp; leave her because that’s what his common sort did” She was wrong. After 4yrs they were still together so Jacqueline’s parents took drastic measures. Her Dad had spent much of his working life as an electrician in Africa, so they decided to return, taking Jacqueline with them. She didn’t want to go. She had a job as a librarian &amp; she had John. 1 month, they promised her. Just 1 month and then she could come home. They promised that they’d already bought her return plane ticket. So she said goodbye to John. And she went with them to Kaduna, in Nigeria. When the month was up, Jacqueline went to her mother &amp; asked for her ticket home. “What ticket?” Her mother feigned ignorance. “Jacqueline...you should have known that you’d never win with me. You’re staying here with us.” They took her passport and Jacqueline was trapped. That night Jacqueline’s parents took her to a gala dinner for ex-pats. Her mother had designs on pairing Jacqueline up with a wealthy businessman twice her age. There was a raffle &amp; the top prize was a ticket from Kano to London. Unbelievable! Jacqueline bought a raffle ticket Fingers crossed she waited hopefully to see if her number came up. But it wasn’t to be. Distraught, she started to cry. The man who was sat next to her, asked why she was so upset. So she told him the whole tale - held in Kaduna against her will. John back in England. He listened without comment and then said: “Come to my hotel room in one hour.” Jacqueline didn’t know what to think, though obviously she was worried about his intentions. And yet, he seemed...good, somehow. She took a chance, and went to the room as he’d asked her to... Turned out he was a very wealthy businessman who owned an airline. He told her to be ready outside her house at dawn in a few days time. A car would be waiting to drive her to Kano. He then handed her a plane ticket to England. Overwhelmed, Jacqueline swore to pay him back. Jacqueline sneaked into her parent’s room &amp; stole back her passport. With trepidation she left with the businessman’s driver for Kano; a journey of nearly 4hrs over bushland and wilderness. She was just 18. Kano-Brussels-Madrid-London-Manchester...where John was waiting. This is the telegram she sent before she left Kaduna: https://t.co/yPGlTPkirR 48 years later, they’re still together. Sometimes, you just know when it’s right. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise. Oh, and it’s Jacqueline’s birthday today too. Happy birthday mum. I love you so much, you brave, courageous woman. https://t.co/GLvVIf1buN I made Twitter cry! I'm so sorry everyone 😂 Here's a cool pic of mum &amp; Dad, taken around 1971.

First, a quick background: @salesforce is telling retailers that they have to stop using their software if they sell some guns, ammo, and accessories: https://t.co/9UxR47sEt9 https://t.co/BsjScWXBdj Their ostensible motivation is an intolerance of Americans' natural right to keep and bear arms, which includes and covers modern, commonly used rifles, the type that @Benioff has a problem with. He has publicly called for their outright ban. See here: https://t.co/Wywmiv7Ft0 @Benioff's moralizing is perfectly fine, but let's put that in perspective. What constitutes @salesforce's markets and clients? Here's a doozy -- the People's Republic of China, aka one-party rule Communist China. Sales Force maintains an office in Beijing https://t.co/QGovd18l64 What has the PRC been up to lately? Oh right, running concentration camps in Xinjiang! That's fine, right @Benioff? A small US-based firearms retailer is a big bad villain you can't do business with. But PRC! Give me Renminbi in exchange for Liberty! https://t.co/kQm95NXG1J What else has the PRC been up to, @Benioff? Running the Great Firewall which blocks searches for something as simple as \"democracy\" or \"Tiananmen Square\"? https://t.co/IKPsT49hCM Of course, let's forget Tibet @Benioff. That quaint freedom of religion thing protected by the First Amendment is just a vestige of American chest-thumping exceptionalism. https://t.co/DGvkQDfUQb An IT guy like @Benioff sure knows what risks mass surveillance poses to human rights, right? But it's more important to make big money from the People's Republic of China while telling small customers like American firearms retailers to go take a hike. https://t.co/Jpzhl3pZP1 Okay, enough about Commie China. Where else does @salesforce sell its product, @Benioff? Oh look - Saudi Arabia! That bastion of human dignity where women just got the right to drive! They even have Sales Force user groups there! https://t.co/q3GYXsuDfH @salesforce will also gladly take revenue Rupees from Pakistan. Forget their blasphemy laws, oppression of Hindus &amp; Christians, sponsorship of terrorism including hiding Osama Bin Laden and Hafiz Mohammed Saeed. Is a 40+% market share good enough @Benioff? https://t.co/LpuoLaKdzN Okay, forget countries. Let's look at businesses. You know, the ones like @CampingWorld that @salesforce won't do business with. Who else do they sell to? Volkswagen? That company that pleaded guilty in the diesel emissions fraud scandal? LOL @Benioff https://t.co/JnMiyEuCFB So @Benioff's logic goes like this -- if you are a 1) small 2) American business that 3) participates in lawful commerce in constitutionally protected arms, you are bad. If you are 1) big 2) foreign 3) strip people of their human rights and dignity, you are good. A libertarian or free-market conservative approach to this would be to say \"laissez faire\" and hope the retailers find competitors. That's a fine position to have. One thing to keep in mind is that financial systems aren't easy to roll out. Once done, it's not easy to migrate. Per this article, it could cost @CampingWorld $2 million - twice the $1 million spent annually on @salesforce - to migrate to buy a competing product, \"migrate data, reconfigure systems and retrain employees\". https://t.co/IoIVOW5jMl Regardless of whether you want free market consequences, or want government to come in and hector @salesforce into submission, the same way @Benioff thinks government should regulate Facebook (as said in this article https://t.co/IjzgXgVFII), PUBLICIZE THEIR HYPOCRISY. If companies like @salesforce want to enjoy America's freedoms to establish thriving businesses, it's fair to expect them to respect their fellow citizens' rights, including their right to keep and bear arms, and engage in lawful commerce pertaining to that. /END","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"760686381886742528"},"id_str":"760686381886742528","name":"Ranjit Singh","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"755"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"392"},"created_at":"Wed Aug 03 03:59:01 +0000 2016","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"21513"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"132"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"224"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"9"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"15"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.80084"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It's called stealth. SUPER stealth.\" After accurately boasting of records for African-Americans and Hispanics, Trump misleadingly says women's unemployment \"recently reached a 65-year low. We think that's probably the lowest ever.\" Was never the lowest ever; was 65-year low in May, went up in June, now 18-year-low. Trump falsely claims of the WTO: \"We always had a minority of judges. They gave us fewer judges than other countries had...I said, I know why.\" Previous fact check on this: https://t.co/scunichobP For the seventh time, Trump repeats his lie about U.S. Steel: \"U.S. Steel now is opening up six plants.\" Trump repeats his lie that the U.S. is now doing much better at the WTO than it used to. Previous fact check on this: https://t.co/OY0Rjb3jsv For the ninth time, Trump claims that he's cut more regulations than even the president who served for 16 years. No president has served longer than Roosvelt's 12. Trump falsely says, \"Obamacare's very rapidly fading away.\" He jabs at McCain again, snarkily saying, \"wonder who that was.\" Trump on U.S. history: \"People don't know too much about McKinley.\" Trump falsely says Apple is spending \"$350 billion on new plants and an incredible campus.\" Apple is not building any new U.S. plants; more than $250 billion of that $350 billion announcement appeared to be pre-planned operational spending. Previous fact check: https://t.co/jOIGWEnhoE Trump says \"globalists\" say it's okay to shut down car factories and fire everybody, but it's not okay to him. Trump, who has long made his products abroad, says it matters to him, unlike others, that things are made in America. And that speech his done. It was not extremely honest. One other thing from that speech: Trump vaguely said he's talking to Mexico's new president about \"doing something very dramatic\" on trade.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"225265639"},"id_str":"225265639","name":"Daniel Dale","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"576705"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1191"},"created_at":"Sat Dec 11 04:18:41 +0000 2010","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"94407"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2464"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7382"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"164"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"492"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.41329"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

But I accept that there is a debate to be had whether or not there would, in reality, be calamitous blockages at the border in a no-deal scenario. 2/ There is an argument that (put crudely), under WTO rules the EU cannot erect unreasonable barriers and border checks to UK goods on SPS/TBT grounds (e.g safeguards on plant, animal and human health). 3/ To do so, the argument goes, would be discriminatory when the EU knows our goods would still be compliant. How could there possibly have been time for any divergence in standards in the days immediately following Brexit that would justify such checks? 4/ This is a fair point, as far as it goes. However, this “smooth border” WTO default scenario makes some assumptions that I think undermine completely Ridley's argument... 5/ Firstly, it gives WTO rules a force and supremacy that simply doesn’t exist in practice. The EU (and by extension the UK) have behaved on a number of fronts in breach of WTO rules for many years (e.g. chlorinated chicken). 6/ There is no magic WTO policeman who comes knocking, even if a breach of rules was clear (which it isn’t in this case – see @GeorgePeretzQC for more https://t.co/8NNaCjEvJb). Basically, how much can we rely on \"WTO rules\" as a restriction on EU behaviour. Not much... 7/ Just saying the EU isn’t allowed to erect checks at the border on day one of Brexit doesn’t mean they won’t. 8/ Secondly, it says nothing of EU tariff collection on our exports to the EU (indeed the Ridley piece explicitly skirts around it). This (and VAT) will cause delays at the border on exports, not to say adding big costs to sectors such as lamb which rely heavily on EU markets. 9/ What of avoiding delays on imports by unilaterally eliminating checks? Well, this would mean (a) reducing/eliminating tariffs across the board to all importers (not just EU) with obvious implications for British farming. 10/ (On which point, was the post-Brexit vision set out at the referendum one which involved the decimation of our British rural economies?!) 11/ …and (b) we would need to reduce or even just scrap safety checks on food coming into the UK. I don’t even know where to go with that as a bad idea…. 12/ However, we might reasonably ask whether, in reality, the EU would erect unnecessary barriers at the border with the mayhem that would follow if it doesn’t have to…? 13/ @hhesterm makes a very good point here on this: https://t.co/JCF4uvjWPM … – what will the customs officer on the ground do? Are we really confident that he or she doesn’t take the safe option and follow the letter of the law and treat the UK as a 3rd country like any other… 14/ Perhaps they will see sense. But it seems this is relying on both EU governments and EU bureaucrats to take a flexible and common-sense approach – precisely the sorts of characteristics that have formed a key criticism of the EU and an argument for leaving 15/","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"33001753"},"id_str":"33001753","name":"Nick von Westenholz","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"2462"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1929"},"created_at":"Sat Apr 18 20:29:09 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"4755"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"123"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"282"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"8"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"19"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.79137"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

One of the most bizarre things in the entire election was the relentless build-up on Fox and other organizations about Hillary being infirm and sick. This started long BEFORE she.... @FoxNews 3...came down with pneumonia. She was accused - on basis of nothing - of being infirm, weak, old, with Parkinsons, with epilepsy, etc etc. It always struck me as the ultimate proof that the conservative media bubble conspires in agreed-upon frauds, since her medical records... @FoxNews 4...were public, and showed nothing. Hannity actually found some hack doctor to come on the air and diagnose Hillary with epilepsy on the basis that she had a goofy head movement once that was obviously her being humorous. Real neurologists - I know a lot of them - were.... @FoxNews 5...flabbergasted that someone claiming to be a doctor would say these things that were demonstrably false.

Until today. Now I get it. It was part of the Stone/Wikileaks conspiracy described in the indictment. Watch your emails, Hannity and Tucker. You might want to see if you are implicated.... @FoxNews 8...here is the relevant info. Stone was publicly claiming to be in contact with Assange by early August 2016. Lots of emails/text message were swapped around about this. (What idiots these guys are.) A guy deemed Person 1 was a political commentator with an online publication... @FoxNews 9...Person 1 was in contact with Stone regarding Wikileaks releases. Stone sent an email to Person 1 asking him to get someone to Assange in Ecuadorian Embassy in London to pick up emails. Person 1 then sent that message to a Trump supporter from London.

It's hush money so he won't reveal what he knows of the events of November 8 and November 9, 2013. https://t.co/rDyWV7repL 2/ A Trump aide told The Daily Caller Trump had \"people\" on his door at the Ritz on November 8, 2013 and Emin offered prostitutes. Schiller says no one was on the door, Trump pal Emin didn't make the offer and...despite being a bodyguard... he {ahem} \"doesn't know\" what happened. 3/ Suddenly, after his testimony exonerating Trump's friend and *absolutely impossibly* saying that he left his principal's door unguarded in a hostile place where they were expecting attempts at blackmail *and doesn't know what happened*... he gets $15,000/month. WAKE UP, MEDIA. 4/ Schiller's story (a) doesn't match the story of the Trump aide quoted by The Daily Caller, (b) doesn't comport with his SOP from guarding Trump's door in other {er} highly leveraged situations, and (c) *makes no sense whatsoever* coming from a bodyguard in a hostile situation. 5/ Now we learn, today, clear as day, without any fuzz on it, that the RNC and Trump campaign were giving out $15,000/month \"jobs\" as hush money to people with stories to tell. And bless Lara's heart—she pretended that she'd just seen that $15,000/month figure for the first time. 6/ And this ISN'T a frivolous matter. The question at hand, which it seems we all know the answer to, is whether there's a criminal conspiracy at the White House to commit a federal felony—witness tampering—to hide that the President of the United States is COMPROMISED by Russia. 7/ To be even clearer, the question of whether there is a criminal conspiracy to tamper with Schiller—a known federal witness in an investigation of the president's (and others') actions—is AS SIGNIFICANT a question, given the testimony being tampered with, as ANY OTHER we have. 8/ I'm sure Schiller wants to be loyal; I'm sure he views discretion as part of his job; I'm sure he likes Trump. I'm sure he thinks Trump's sex life is a private affair—which it WOULD be were he NOT President of the United States. Blackmail on POTUS is a national security issue. 9/ Having looked at this from the standpoint of a criminal investigator—work I used to do—I'll now look at it from the standpoint of a criminal defense lawyer, which is also work I used to do: if Mueller can squeeze Schiller he'll get FAR more than the events of November 8, 2013. 10/ Trump trusted Schiller so much that he brought him to *business dinners*, for instance the June 15, 2013 Las Vegas meeting—with 4 people later involved in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting—at which he decided to take $20 million from Agalarov to bring Miss Universe to Moscow. 11/ On the list of Trump-Russia witnesses who really know a *ton*, you have Flynn (nabbed), Gates (nabbed), Manafort (awaiting verdict), Cohen (possible cooperator), Sater (possible cooperator), (Erik) Prince and Schiller. I'd put them before Jared, Ivanka, Sessions, and Bannon. 12/ Here's why: Schiller knows who Trump met with. Did he meet Kislyak in Trump Tower in December 2016? Gorkov? Did he call or meet Putin in November 2013 (as Trump *sometimes* claims he did)? Was he in secretive transition meetings with Flynn and K.T. McFarland? See what I mean? 13/ So if you're watching cable news today and someone says, \"Oh, this Omarosa thing with Lara Trump is just *silly*!\" I can tell you that's not an attorney or investigator, and if it is, it's one who knows little to nothing about the Trump-Russia investigation. It's that simple. 14/ I learned as an investigator that it's not always the fact you discover that matters—it's the additional discoveries the fact leads you to. Any investigator or criminal lawyer sees that what Omarosa revealed today can LEAD TO critical breaks in the Trump-Russia investigation. 15/ Schiller has a rarified type of testimonial evidence that even major players in the Trump-Russia story (Flynn, Manafort, Gates and so on) *don't*—Donald Trump's daily, often secretive movements and schedules. Mueller should want Schiller in the bag *right now* and *bad*. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"3223426134"},"id_str":"3223426134","name":"Seth Abramson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"676351"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"38"},"created_at":"Fri May 22 16:19:26 +0000 2015","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"53065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"15"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"12223"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"33810"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"815"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"2254"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"2.25011"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

This is almost certainly a signal that Flynn has a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller. Read the charge here: https://t.co/fpFBqwhI6S 2/ We have heard reports that Flynn was under investigation for a wide variety of crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent. 3/ If Flynn didn't cooperate, he could have been charged with other crimes, such as failure to register. For instance, Manafort was charged with a wide variety of crimes. Flynn's indictment could have looked like that. 4/ This charging document is called an \"information,\" which is the same kind of charging document that Papadopoulos had. All that means is that the defense agreed that Mueller didn't have to present the document to a grand jury for approval. 5/ The main benefit that Flynn appears to be receiving in this plea deal is that he is pleading guilty to one count of making a false statement to the FBI instead of pleading guilty to other crimes. The false statement charge carries a five-year maximum sentence. 6/ That means that no matter how bad the judge thinks Flynn is, or what sentence the judge would like to impose, he is \"capped\" at a five-year maximum sentence. That could be a very significant benefit to Flynn. 7/ This doesn't mean that the judge won't consider other things that Flynn did. In fact, the judge is required to consider all of the \"history and characteristics\" of Flynn, which includes other wrongdoing by him. 8/ But this plea could significantly affect the recommended advisory sentence under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. While the guidelines will factor in criminal conduct beyond the false statements it will only consider crimes that are part of the same \"course of conduct.\" 9/ Flynn's lobbying work, for example, may not be part of the same course of conduct as the false statements. So this could result in a lower recommended Guidelines sentence, which could influence the sentence imposed by the judge. 10/ Flynn could still be charged with other crimes, either by Mueller or by a state Attorney General like Eric Schneiderman. That is a hammer that Mueller has over Flynn, if he does not truthfully testify and fully cooperate. 11/ That said, if Flynn cooperates, I don't expect that he will be charged with other crimes. That means that he's received a substantial benefit from Mueller, and suggests that Flynn can provide \"substantial assistance\" to Mueller. 12/ \"Substantial assistance\" means that Flynn can help Mueller make a case against someone else that Mueller thinks is worth charging. Generally defendants don't get as much credit for \"cooperating down\" or cooperating against equals. 13/ That doesn't tell us who Flynn is cooperating against. It's possible that Flynn is cooperating against associates as well as Manafort and Gates, and Mueller thinks that's sufficient. But there's a reasonable chance that it's someone bigger than that. 14/ None of this tells us what will happen with Flynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr. I suspect that not charging Flynn Jr. might be part of the deal, but that would also be a very substantial benefit and would suggest greater cooperation by Flynn. 15/ Flynn won't be sentenced until *after* all of his cooperation is complete, so the judge can consider his cooperation and factor that into the sentence. So we won't know for quite a while, maybe years (if Manafort goes to trial), what his sentence will be. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"759481842814726144"},"id_str":"759481842814726144","name":"Renato Mariotti","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"203570"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1014"},"created_at":"Sat Jul 30 20:12:36 +0000 2016","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"24216"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3581"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"11846"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"224"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"740"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.32504"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

Right to free and compulsory primary education. Right to available and accessible secondary education.. 👇👇 Right to available and accessible secondary education (including technical and vocational education and training), made progressively free. ASUU should realise that in the scheme of play, they are on the lowest rung of the ladder. The least of our worries.. The reason why we have mass illiteracy, mass under-development and unemployment in Nigeria is simply due to the skewed focus on ASUU and the Universities. The FG has been subsidizing a privilege while neglecting the basic right of its citizenry. I said this earlier on my TL..the FG subsidized my Medical degree and numerous other graduates of federal tertiary universities at the detriment of millions of kids out of school who are constantly being denied their basic right to education. ASUU is not our problem in Nigeria unfortunately the FG went into an agreement to spent such a whooping amount of money on them. The FG is also the highest employer of academic labour ( ASUU ) with huge recurrent expenditure on their salaries and allowances. FG to shift it's focus and revamp the system. China has 99% attendance in primary schools but only 9.5% of Chinese citizens have bachelor degrees. My phone was probably made by a Chinese with basic education. Their kids exposed to coding in preschool https://t.co/KX9Bu3exLG Dwindling revenue in sharp contrast with rapid population growth has now made it impossible for the FG to continue to subsidize tertiary education and fund ASUU. The decay in the educational sector is an obvious result of this fact. It's time to let go..choose quality over cheap Let the FG set up an educational loan system and a scholarship system. The FG cannot afford tuition free system for every Tom, dick and harry especially the lazy and unserious students who on campus to constitute nuisance. 30% enrollment on scholarship.. 1m naira per annum scholarship..give this to the best brains. Crunch the figures from JAMB statistics and factor it into our budget.. Grant the universities autonomy, let them charge their fees. Students who did not qualify for scholarship and cannot afford school fees.. Will be offered educational loans to the tune of the fees needed per session for 4 years and 5 years respectively. Students can pay back once they become gainfully employed. NUC as a regulator would ensure that Universities don't charge arbitrary fees or exploit students.. I am a beneficiary of the tuition free / subsidized system and I was lucky to get good and quality education. It is no longer feasible and we must tell ourselves the harsh reality. Somebody must pay for quality education. Either the govt or us the citizens.. ASUU will keep on holding every govt by the jugular, they will go on strike with this system till infinity. Trending hashtags and sentiments on this issue without valuable discourse around it does not show any form of intellectual acuity.. This present system has outlived its usefulness. My father enjoyed it in University of Ibadan - he had a room to himself, had meal tickets, sponsored exchange programs, free tuition, free shuttle to school.. I enjoyed it with a slight decline in quality, now it is dead.. FG should hands off and channel resources to other tiers or forms of education. We need people with skills, we want to assemble cars, phones, we need textile to boom, we need people to fabricate steel, we need IT programmers, we need skilled and mechanized farmers.. We need business men, the Ladipo type..who can turn 1m to 10m in few weeks. We need e- commerce skills. We need people to make shoes and garments.. We need to quickly grow as a nation..we need people to operate cranes, forklift, excavators .. ASUU should realize that the method of funding University education and holding the govt to ransom via strike actions is outdated No sentiments, the FG can no longer fund quality education for everyone. Let ASUU resume and continue to channel a path to sustainable financing.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"193195646"},"id_str":"193195646","name":"Dr. Guendouzi (Yaro mai Lokachi )","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"13241"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2520"},"created_at":"Tue Sep 21 06:23:51 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"24261"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"7653"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"9685"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"478"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"605"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.93647"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

And the host did sing with one voice, ‘ungodly woman, thou foolest us not. We know the true reason thou despisest Saint Jeremy.’ 1 And she did say unto them ‘share thy hot take.’ And with righteous wrath they did declare, ‘thou fearest Saint Jeremy, friend of the poor, because he shall take from thee in taxation much more even than Herod, and so thou attackest the meek and honest saviour of this land.’ 2 And she did reply, ‘I shall not call ye dimwits, for it is the season of goodwill, but tis not Saint Jeremy who shall tax me, nay, not even if he enters the house of Number Ten, for my tax rates are set by Queen Nicola, in whose kingdom I do abide, and unto her I do pay 3 my full portion, seeking neither to flee to Monaco nor to hide my gold in far flung lands, like St Jacob, Patron Saint of Filthy Hypocrites.’ ‘Speak not of hypocrites!’ cried the host, ‘for thou dost claim to care about the poor yet doth rail against their champion, St Jeremy!’ 4 And she did answer, ‘How shall the poor fare under Brexit, which thy Saint hath always in his secret heart desired, yet he hath not admitted what was in his heart, lest fewer attend his next Sermon on the Glastonbury B Stage.’ And they did answer, ‘Saint Jeremy will achieve 5 a miracle, and he shall bring forth a Jobs First Brexit and all the land shall rejoice.’ And she did answer, ‘bollocks.’ But she bethought her of the season of goodwill, and repenting of her ire she did speak further. ‘I have, for all my life, voted Labour, yet now I cannot.’ 6 ‘But his goodness doth shine out of his every orifice!’ cried the host, swarming anew into her mentions. ‘Behold his beard! Look upon this picture of him being led off by police when he was protesting racism in all its forms!’ And she did say, ‘I have looked upon his beard 7 ...and also upon this picture. It is a good picture and I do like a beard, as I have oft declared. Yet must I protest, thou it breaketh my heart so to do, that this party of Labour, which I have so long loved, has become, under St Jeremy -‘ 8 ‘Speak not of the Jews!’ cried the host. ‘Why must thou speak so oft of the Jews?’ ‘Yea, I must speak,’ said she, ‘for when Jews no longer feel safe in Labour then I too must leave.’ And one of the host did shout something about the Rothschilds 9 and he was hastily hushed by his brethren, who did declare, ‘he is not one of ours, thou he sports a #JC4PM halo.’ And another did speak and he said, ‘it is not antisemitic to criticise Israel,’ and she did put her face in her hands and want to weep. 10 But she did then look up and see many stars shining brightly in the sky and lo, they did arrange themselves before her eyes into a ‘who would make the best Prime Minister poll’ and she did cry, ‘Will ye not raise up your eyes to the Heavens? See there the People’s mind!’ 11 And they did look up at the stars and read there that St Jeremy was, as for ages past, in third place after Pontus May and Don’t Know. And she spake further, ‘do ye not see that St Jeremy is hurting your party, yea, that his inability even to organise a vote of no confidence 12 doth embolden and strengthen this calamitous government, of which all despair?’ But they did close their eyes to the stars and some did answer, ‘you are a fool who doth not understand St Jeremy’s master plan’ 13 and others still did beseech the woman to descend from the ivory tower in which, for the purposes of this story, they would wish her to dwell. And they besought her to descend into Bethlehem, and go to a certain allotment, 14 where she would find the Messiah busy with his marrows and she would be filled with the spirit of Momentum. But she did shake her head and declare that she was and would remain an unbeliever, yet full sorrowful she was, for Labour had been her home. 15 And the host did despise and condemn her, and many did tell her to fuck off and join the Tories, and before they did depart one of their number cried unto her, ‘it’s because he’ll tax you more, isn’t it,’ and she did sigh and wished him a Merry Christmas. 16X","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"62513246"},"id_str":"62513246","name":"J.K.

How could science &amp; society be affected by such abject silliness? How indeed: (1/16) Hundreds of scientists recently signed a letter to Nature—one of the two leading science journals in the world—which claims that science has neither a definition, nor a reliable test, for sex. https://t.co/pyNxDgDdKG Is it possible that rabid Trump hatred has confused people, and they could become unconfused once he’s out of office? Sure, but that doesn’t change the fact that they are doing real damage (&amp; also that they should grow up already). The full letter: https://t.co/HW5SXGqZK8 This excellent piece by @SwipeWright describes, in part, “a chilling effect that causes scientists to self-censor,” due to this ideology. Reasonable people are ever more quiet on basic issues of fact: https://t.co/5inrE4Fihu Cited therein is this absurdity from Scientific American: https://t.co/kNjCzmffN5 Recognizing biological reality does not make a person transphobic. Yes, intersex exists. Yes, even human chimeras exist (!). No, those facts do not put the lie to binary sexual reproduction. There are two types of gametes in animals (“anisogamy”): eggs and sperm. Gender Studies and its ilk—Grievance Studies, the term that @peterboghossian, @HPluckrose, and @ConceptualJames coined—has lost the plot. Seriously, the narratives being peddled are absurd and laughable. Except not enough people are laughing. https://t.co/WgHhFwtU7D See especially the “dildos” paper. One of their outrageous suggestions: Men who fail to anally self-penetrate with sex toys are exhibiting transphobia. Yup. Accepted and published in the journal Sexuality and Culture. https://t.co/IVZilltBZR The more prevalent this kind of thinking is on college campuses, the more power the ideology has in hiring decisions on campus, on training of teachers for the K12 system, and on the larger world. What happens on campus does not stay on campus. Remember the google memo? @JamesADamore wrote a long memo considering why there might not be a 1:1 sex ratio among software engineers at google. He invoked personality differences between men and women. Fragile employees needed time off, and he was fired. https://t.co/jfxHzDXYtE In this event, which I did with James Damore, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose, activists stormed out when I made the outlandish claim that men and women are, on average, physically different (19 min-ish): https://t.co/pSE2iH7Zqr However: the timing of the activists’ storming out was coincidental, as it turns out. Here is my framing of why I find this type of “activism” so dangerous. It is “read-only.” It does not respond to new information. https://t.co/gyfiJn0VlQ This ideology has oozed off campus, into high schools &amp; grade schools, into cubicles &amp; theater troupes &amp; retail establishments. I’ve seen signs advising me not to address cashiers by gender. It’s a madness that celebrates fragility, and denies reality. https://t.co/jb3KUkyCwf A U.S. congresswoman has petitioned for trans-women’s rights to compete against women in powerlifting. If natal males are allowed to compete against natal females, the natal males will win. In contact sports, they will also hurt women in the process. https://t.co/CLoGWT4VuP Testosterone organizes the body and brain from before birth. It also activates “secondary sex characteristics,” like hair and muscle growth and the lowering of one’s voice. But those organizational effects, including things like skeletal form and brain architecture, persist. Testosterone doesn’t make a boy male—but it contributes to “masculinizing” him. Similarly, a Y chromosome doesn’t make a boy male—but it, and the SRY gene on it, initiates a cascade of “masculinizing” events. Pretending otherwise is dangerous, and regressive. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"870324519788879872"},"id_str":"870324519788879872","name":"Heather E Heying","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"68456"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"286"},"created_at":"Thu Jun 01 17:01:50 +0000 2017","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"3431"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1121"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7056"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"70"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"441"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.39838"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

(For those who might dispute the statement, Bannon brought you \"Destroy the administrative state,\" and the Republicoup protect him and the Destroyer in Chief.) A thread. 2. The government is the referee in society. The government's main job is to protect the weak from the strong, the unarmed from the armed, owners from thieves, eaters and drinkers from poisoners. 3. Many of the most profitable industries today are only profitable because the owners can take the profits, and poison the air and water. They can sell the throwaway plastic containers and externalize the cleanup costs. They can rig the financial system to cheat most people. 4. They can inject poisons into the only Earth we have, and sell the fossil fuels that are squeezed out in the process. They can build fences and, yes, walls, around the most desirable property, and exclude all but their rich peers from access. 6. They can buy up industry after industry, company after company, until it is only they and their friends who are bidding for employees. Then they can make sure nobody bids a living wage. Monopoly does not hurt only consumers. It is death on producers. 7. When your income stream is derived from destroying the planet, the atmosphere, the biosphere, society and any shred or memory of fairness, it behooves you to see to it that there is no referee. The government *was* the referee. 8. I hope you don't believe that the month-long shutdown was about a wall. It was not about a wall. The month-long shutdown permanently weakened \"the administrative state.\" It gave organized crime, which literally does include so-called legitimate industry, a huge head start. 9. What we call \"organized crime\" sells you drugs, hookers, and gambling. What we call \"legitimate business\" pollutes your air, your water, poisons your children and old people, and steals your wildlife. They sell you guns. There. Is. No. Difference. They don't like government. 10. Why do you think that (A) The Republicoup tells you government is your enemy, and (B) All the big money supports the Republicoup ? 11. Do you know why they could pull off the longest shutdown in history? Because they have spent 39 years convincing the not-very-smart and the I-love-the-poorly-educated that government is their enemy. So sure, shut it down. It ain't no good to me. 12. And we played right into their hands. We usually do. We talked about the \"800,000 people not getting paid.\" And they said, \"Fuck them. They work for the government. They're a bunch of free-loaders who don't do anything for anybody.\" 13. We have a giant uphill battle on our hands, should we choose to engage it. We have to sell the concept that government is good, to a huge voting public who is *positive* that government is their worst enemy. 14. Money now owns our elections. Surely anyone who has eyes can see that the people who can afford to fund our electoral system isn't going to allow anyone to participate who might clip their wings. Our Constitution has been hacked and rewritten, and we've let them claim it. 15. I'm going to re-up my pinned thread here, to explain what I mean. But the point is, screaming in outrage when they seat a Bret Kavanaugh isn't going to help. Ever been to a fire safety class? 16. If you want to put out a fire, you aim your extinguisher at the base of the flames. Whatever lie Trumpov told yesterday, I can assure you it wasn't the base of the flames. Quit helping them hide. Quit falling for the act. 17. It's not just Trumpov. He's a pissant, a small time mobster. He's just there to piss you off. And he's good at it. But. An entire, corrupt, whole worldwide organization is what stole your country. They're smart, they're ruthless, and they're winning. Notice them.

The temperature doesnt stay the same all of the time. The Earth's position changes during the year causing the sun to warm it differently. It also spins so is cooler at night etc. So a normal jet stream tends to look like this and shifts predictably with seasons. https://t.co/pzlWxzFOFZ 5. These high atmosphere winds bring us much of our weather, &amp; because they are so reliable in the way they move &amp; change from winter to summer they bring us mostly predictable seasonal weather. So predictable, in fact, that our ecosystems have developed in response to them. https://t.co/A7IjbgqF9P 6. Global warming is causing warming at the poles. (Among other things.) When the air at the poles is warmer then the interaction between warm and cold air isnt as forceful which causes the jet stream to slow and meander like a slow river on an open plain looking more like this. https://t.co/K1vYFNm51X 7. This brings much colder air further south causing winter cold and storms in the US that previously were kept in Canada, while the Arctic has warmer than average temperatures. It also causes changes in rain and snow patterns. https://t.co/VkKGAqbkGZ 8. The current cold spell includes a related phenomenon. Scientists believe a meandering current of air cut through the polar vortex this year causing it to split in two with one segment getting pushed south to hover and swirl over the US, waiting for spring to dissipate it. https://t.co/zawicWYQ4R 9. Another rarely mentioned result of predictable air currents is that when the strong current of air like a jet stream encounters a storm at high altitudes it dissipates the swirling force, keeping storms small. Weaker jet streams = bigger storms. https://t.co/8P4jm6vg9s 10. Climate science is complex with lots of moving parts, many of them happening out of sight high above the Earth. Everything we can say about it is over simplified and sometimes not yet known. This makes it easy to ignore or deny. https://t.co/6s1gEvBauU 11. Beyond that anyone profiting off (or using) coal, oil, plastic etc. has a vested interest in ignoring (or even suppressing) the understanding of climate change. We all love our cars plastics, heat, convenience... https://t.co/CfKWQPgnCU 12.The warmer the Arctic gets the more the jet stream will shift and meander. Our winters will get colder, summers drier, storms bigger. Weather patterns will change killing eco systems. This is why sharing info on climate change is absolutely vital today. /end https://t.co/UuLbUAyI9Y Some additional links to read more: https://t.co/m9X2wetyFW One way the jet stream can move the polar vortex https://t.co/CdDhTGdMz1 More on the vortex \"...can cause kinks in the jet stream so that, instead of flowing west to east, there are a lot of dips and ridges. And the waves in the jet stream can disrupt the lower (tropospheric) polar vortex, break off a lobe and force it south.\" https://t.co/i7pSGX7fyj","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"821846067591286784"},"id_str":"821846067591286784","name":"Troll Huntress","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"13769"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"14031"},"created_at":"Wed Jan 18 22:25:46 +0000 2017","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"46112"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"501"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"923"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"31"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"58"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.80413"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

A small opening that opens a very large one. Peter Strzok is one such keyhole. The facts of the case and timeline are most fascinating. 2. Strzok's dismissal was revealed less than a day after Gen. Flynn pleaded guilty. Remember that. Less than 24 hours later. However the dismissal occurred over the summer. I'll repeat: he was dismissed over the summer, we hear about it a day after Flynn pleads guilty. 3. Strzok was texting pro-Hillary text messages with Lawyer Lisa Page who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Page and Strrzok were having an extramarital affair. The two pro Hillary lovebirds exchanged texts during both Hillary server and Russia- Trump investigation 4. Strzok was subsequently demoted to a job in human resources, Page left Mueller’s team in July, BEFORE the text messages surfaced. Again note the timeline. https://t.co/S0S7EFR3J1 5. Strozk was a part of FBI's interview with Hillary on July 2, 2016 FEW days before Comey announced he was declining to recommend Hillary's prosecution in connection with her use, as secretary of state, of a private email server. https://t.co/jigfpZSUEe 6. Strzok was key figure when FBI, in 2016, received Trump \"dossier\" and launched a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the election that ultimately came to encompass FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate. 7. Strzok briefed house intelligence committee on Dec. 5, 2016, within months of that session HIC investigators were contacted by an informant suggesting that there was “documentary evidence” that Strzok was purportedly obstructing the House probe into the dossier. 8. HIC Chairman Devin Nunes asked Rod Rosenstein in Oct 2017 who oversees the Trump-Russia probe since Jeff Sessions' recusal, to make Strzok available to committee for questioning. This was denied: on broad \"personnel\" grounds. 9. While Strzok’s removal from the Mueller team was a matter of public record by August, at no point did we know about his Pro-Hillary texts and overall stance. This was revealed by \"sources\" only a day after Gen Flynn's plea. 10. Think about the fact that Jeff Sessions' recusal put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein next in line to be asked directly for facts pertaining to Strzok and his involvement in Hillary's server as well as the Trump dossier. Coincidence? 11. How about the timing of Strzok's extramarital texts to Lisa page? Who leaked that information? Why was information leaked strategically right after Gen. Flynn's guilty plea. I doubt there are any coincidences in what is going on right now. 12. Strzok is the key that opens a Pandora's box of treasonous activity designed to get Hillary elected, bury her illegal activities and subjugate the will of the American people. 13. Remember Trump's \"You're going to be in jail\" comment to Hillary during the debate, followed by his own asking of her to be \"left alone. Then Jeff Sessions recused himself. All made little sense when it happened. 14. Trump does very little without knowing way in advance what it's going to result in. He then confuses the hell out of the media by his obtuse tweets that are designed to discombobulate and stun idiots of all manners. Every now and then he tweets facts. https://t.co/frpwkyIZ59 15. By then the media is so behind figuring out exactly what's happening, it is all too late. He is playing 3D chess with Mr. Magoo-like MSM. Here is another one of ABC's Magoo's.

Officer Singh's murderer was pulled over by officer Singh for his 3rd DUI, shot the officer &amp; ran In CA, DUI is not a violent crime, ICE can't be informed The whole POINT of DUI is that people are killed by drunk drivers Recall that just two weeks ago two innocent Californians were killed by Gustavo Garcia an illegal criminal alien, who was deported twice. Sheriff blamed sanctuary city law even then. https://t.co/MiMGbnLfFX The random drive-by shooting at the orchard marked the beginning of what local officials would later describe as one man’s “reign of terror” in agricultural Tulare County. Within 24 hours, Gustavo Garcia would kill one, injure at least six others. Garcia robbed thousands of dollars from a convenience store and lead a wrong-way chase down a busy highway in a stolen truck, according to police, who believe he may also have been responsible for a second homicide that is still under investigation. County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux told reporters Wednesday. But because of the law, he said, his officers were unable to coordinate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Read that, read that again, and again. The sheriff said \"That tool has been removed from our hands,”. “And because of that, our county was shot up by a violent criminal.” Garcia, 36, had been removed from the U.S. twice, first in 2004 and then again 2014, ICE officials said in a statement to local media outlets Before his 2nd deportation Garcia spent 27 months in federal prison. ICE called it “an unfortunate &amp; extremely tragic example of how public safety is impacted with laws or policies limiting local law enforcement agencies ability to cooperate with ICE.” ICE said that... While Garcia was in jail, ICE officials learned about his arrest and issued an immigration hold. But Tulare County Sheriff’s Office let him go — because they had no choice, sheriff Boudreaux said. Under state law, the office is barred from honoring ICE’s detainer requests, unless the agency obtains an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge. You just can't make this up... Before SB 54, Gustavo Garcia would have been turned over to ICE officials,” sheriff Boudreaux said in a statement. “That’s how we’ve always done it, day in and day out. After SB 54, we no longer have the power to do that.\" Instead, Garcia was released. Just 3 minutes after drive-by shooting at the orchard on Sunday, surveillance camera footage captured him wandering into the AA Gas and Grub mini mart in Exeter, he fired several shots at the ceiling and told the cashier to give him $2,000 in cash. Later that night, he reportedly shot at a woman sitting in her car in the parking lot of a Motel 6 in Tulare and sent a volley of bullets flying into a Shell gas station in nearby Pixley before shooting and killing a man who was standing outside a gas station. Visalia police got another call: Garcia was standing in his ex-girlfriend’s backyard, yelling threats at her as he shot at her house. But by the time they arrived, he had disappeared. A deputy from the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office spotted Garcia’s gray Honda SUV on a flat county road outside the city and tried to stop him. Garcia shot at the patrol car and ran into a nearby orchard. Garcia came across three farm workers in a GMC,brandishing his gun, he took their vehicle. He droy south in the northbound lanes of Highway 65, smashed into multiple cars at speeds of more than 100 mph when he was ejected from the truck and was pronounced dead at the scene. I couldn't write this scene for a movie car chase and yet this is what happened in California... 2 weeks ago.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"879548970082721792"},"id_str":"879548970082721792","name":"Rising serpent","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"51304"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3125"},"created_at":"Tue Jun 27 03:56:30 +0000 2017","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"39258"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3019"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"4567"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"189"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"285"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.04787"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Sadness","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

I've been talking to some friends about this and I've decided to make a thread with some of my favourite 'classical' Libyan songs, both old and (relatively) new. Here goes First off, the music of Sidi Boumedienne, known as Shadi Al-Jabal, from the earlier parts of the 20th century, Benghazi. In this song, he wishes he never saw 'the blackness of his/her eyes.' https://t.co/qaPBAA03T1 More Boumeddienne. This song is very popular with the older generation in Benghazi. It's all about old places, memories, lost people. I grew up hearing my father sing it: https://t.co/zAP19C0VlC This is Nouri Kamal, from Tripoli. This song is called 'Zahrat il-Yasmeen' or 'Jasmine Flower.' So so beautiful: https://t.co/bbddoryhJB This is Mohammed Sadeg (I think) also from Tripoli/ the West. This song is called 'habiba' or beloved. One of my mum's favourite: https://t.co/MKA66LCatn Now the classical Libyan music scene is very male dominated. But there are a few amazing and well loved women too and without doubt Tunis Muftah, from Al-Bayda in East Libya, is of of the most popular. Here is her song 'Ma Tagyeb' or don't leave:https://t.co/BQ62Pywwyz This is Fatima Ahmed, from (I think) Benghazi, singing 'Izz Elrafagha' or the dearest of companions. Another song I grew up hearing my mum sing: https://t.co/eOkSUZzlW1 This is Salmeen Zarrough, another famous woman singer from Eastern Libya (I think), singing 'A'hadtni tsoun al-mahaba' or your promised to safeguard our love: https://t.co/rqB0ShI5RU This is Saif Al-Nasr, I am not sure where in Libya he's from but he is relatively modern. This is one of his most poignant songs 'Ayni Bakat' or my eye cried: https://t.co/BZW72uhkjS This is Adel Abdul-Majid, from Benghazi. He was my grandma's neighbour! This is my favourite song ever, 'Haz ElShog' or my longing shook: https://t.co/bFtKVu2o3V This is Abdul-Latif El-Hewel, from Tripoli. This song is called 'Al-Wafa ya Ridi' or loyalty, my intended: https://t.co/fz9hBLv0jP This is Ali Sha'lia, not sure where in Libya he's from. This song is really popular and is called 'Noor Ayoun' or light of eyes: https://t.co/0VZmHjASA2 This is Mohammed Kabazi, from Tripoli, signing 'Allah Ysamkhek ya Azeez Aliya' or God forgive you dearest one. I really like this one: https://t.co/nnOF84rBzC This is Mustafa Talib from (I think) Tripoli/ Western Libya. Here he is signing a folkloric song from Fezzan, South of Libya, Fi Moula El-Khodod https://t.co/MS2HPzjZyM That's it for now because I can go on and on lol! I might add with time some more songs but I think for now this is enough! Although I grew up hearing my parents sing some of these songs, I never heard them in the original. I only came to them in my early 20s. I researched them, asked my parents to help me find them. I feel so connected to (an idea of?)

The US brought in Jim Steele, who had advised US-backed death squads in El Salvador in the 1980s. At the height of the Iraqi civil war 3,000 Iraqis were dying a month. https://t.co/37UZK24pMT The US troops in Iraq fired tens of thousands of rounds of radioactive depleted uranium, often in close proximity to civilian areas. https://t.co/MzHihI7Duv This and other heavy metals used in US bombs have caused widespread birth defects in Iraq. https://t.co/4R43TFplf0 The US siege of Fallujah involved cutting off water &amp; blocking food/medical supplies into the city for 3 weeks. Many women/children took their chances &amp; fled, despite the danger. However men were prevented from leaving &amp; were ordered back into the kill zone. Due to the enormous US firepower used on Fallujah, the city has been left w/ a toxic legacy. One study shows incidents of infant mortality, cancer and leukemia exceed those reported by survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. https://t.co/DJKe00D5He The US engaged in routine torture of Iraqi prisoners, most infamously at Abu Ghraib, where Saddam’s security forces had notoriously tortured prisoners. The US troops at Abu Ghraib engaged in physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, torture, rape, sodomy, and murder. https://t.co/u5ZS9vLujr The most egregious allegation at Abu Ghraib are that US soldiers raped Iraqi women, beat people to death &amp; that there was a videotape, apparently shot by US personnel, showing Iraqi guards raping young boys. https://t.co/YdbQrH173I The US tried, in every possible way, to prevent elections in Iraq. The US was finally forced to allow elections by mass outpourings of people demanding elections. When the US/UK finally allowed elections, they did their best to subvert them. https://t.co/uwLKGG2UKu US relied on vicious mercenaries like Blackwater, which routinely engaged in murder and earned millions to help the US brutal occupation. The most infamous of their crimes was the Nisour Square Massacre, which killed 17 Iraqi civilians &amp; wounded dozens more. https://t.co/XCYCvJRHn1 The war in Iraq was launched as part of the US war on Terror, however the war drastically increased incidents of terror. Jihadis from around the world came to fight the Americans. The first ever suicide bombing in Iraq took place in 2003, after the US invasion. https://t.co/PYy3ex7vo2 US forces regularly targeted civilians in Iraq. This was demonstrated by the “Collateral Murder” video leaked by Chelsea Manning, in which a US Apache fires on unarmed Iraqis &amp; then again on the 1st responders. 12 ppl were killed &amp; 2 children were wounded. https://t.co/viYL34q8RG The brutal US-run prisons in Iraq became Jihadi Universities where future terrorists became radicalized &amp; built a network. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was held for 10 months in a US-run prison in Iraq. https://t.co/KWfhpP6ohr After the war, Iraq suffered major destruction of its rich cultural heritage, which included looting and burning of the Iraq National Museum &amp; a large number of mosque bombings. https://t.co/ETDedNq7JB US military bases produce an enormous amount of toxic trash &amp; US military burned it all in huge open air pits. The result has been 1000s of US troops &amp; Iraqi’s living near US bases have become seriously sick or developed cancer. https://t.co/yumYFNMMxa War criminals like George W. Bush (and the rest of the architects of the war) should be in prison instead of running around free while Iraqis continue to suffer the consequences of the war. https://t.co/grDCFZLMR4","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1521308238"},"id_str":"1521308238","name":"American Values","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"44080"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"10"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 16 05:53:20 +0000 2013","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"1595"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3222"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3363"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"201"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"210"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"2.27504"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

It’s called a block list. It’s one of twitters core functionalities. Wow, look here I can even see and manage my own block list from within the app! 🤓 Now, you’re hardly complaining about someone using a choice to block ya are ya? ➡️ https://t.co/ouZBzzwdKb “I don’t care who you block you can’t share your block list like that” Au contraire my ignorant friend, that is also a functionality of Twitter- the ability to export and import block lists. https://t.co/opDkdSDYgz ➡️ https://t.co/73u3mX3d4Z “But but you’re not using Twitter functionality you’re using an app”. Actually blocking is also available in the twitter API. The @blocktogether app is even a bit cleverer- it checks your followings first and never blocks someone you follow. https://t.co/WbHBonxfwe ➡️ https://t.co/bG87oIuLw9 So we’ve established that blocking, blocking programmatically and sharing block lists are all part of Twitters functionality. ➡️ https://t.co/ZDELifxSnW “But... but... I can’t opt out/ I didn’t give permissions”. Firstly, no one needs permission to block you (lol unless you’re a certain president). Secondly, block lists aren’t even the only twitter lists you can’t opt out of. Let’s see what lists I’m in: ➡️ https://t.co/E1jsW1HxZp Hmm what other arguments have this bunch of bananas been shouting? Oh “you’re storing my private information”. Nope, @Twitter is storing your data, and you gave twitter permission to. Let’s look at the privacy policy: https://t.co/I3hszlAQUA https://t.co/GHNHOdSRwI “But... but... GDPR!” Firstly, I’ve yet to be convinced any of the crusty crabs complaining about GDPR know what it even is. As a non commercial entity, GDPR doesn’t apply. Even if it did, which it doesn’t, see entire thread so far, everything is within the rules. ➡️ “This is a list of political opinions and that’s not allowed”. Again nope. The block list is a list consisting of people that in my opinion spread misinformation, are time wasters, send graphic pictures, or send abuse. I’m entitled to that view, or would you censor me? ➡️ I mean, the fact that many of em share one or two of the same views is largely irrelevant - it’s not a list of antichoicers, it’s a list of silly sausages that in my opinion are better ignored. ➡️ https://t.co/xQEkwBK7Lh Also, I’ve seen screenshots of “threats” from someone that’s been blocked who also has me blocked- you are literally complaining about something that you’ve also done- exercised your freedom to block someone. *facepalm* ➡️ https://t.co/ERsbUjZD8d “But you’re creating an echo chamber” So what? If people want to filter their social media accounts to exclude people that are acting the eejit, fair play to em. My twitter is a much better place now, and I’ve had 100s of msgs of support from subscribers saying similar. ➡️ “But the referendum is over”. Weirdly the abuse seems to have ramped up since, a contagious case of loseritis I think. Regardless, the block list is now set to private- no new subscribers can be added. A few blocks are being made here on there on request. ➡️ We are figuring out next steps, and while I will be stepping away from the project now that we’ve achieved our objective, I will still be around for tech support on unsubscribing etc. ➡️ I think that covers all the complaints and threats that the hive mind have been throwing at me. 🙄 At the end of the day it boils down to “be better and maybe then people won’t want to block you”. ➡️ Also, I personally take the consistent negative chatter about repeal shield to be a massive compliment on how well the tool has functioned. It kneecapped the abuse and misinformation strategy many wanted to employ. I revel in your anger, that’s just my opinion. 😉 https://t.co/uxK0I8B3Lu","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"376943760"},"id_str":"376943760","name":"Hazel McHelpItsTooHot","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"1654"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1368"},"created_at":"Tue Sep 20 19:12:55 +0000 2011","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"16421"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"90"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"745"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"6"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"47"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.77816"},"all_hashtags":["repealshield"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Anger","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification. He is happy to see his father, who is now retired. His father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn't have to. Joe gets back in his car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good.... He doesn't mention that the #GOP have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys. Joe agrees: \"We don't need those big-government liberals ruining our lives! After all, I'm a self-made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have.\"","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2957772357"},"id_str":"2957772357","name":"Wally Rogers","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"3672"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"4682"},"created_at":"Sat Jan 03 03:15:27 +0000 2015","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"28186"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"16"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1837"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"6529"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"115"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"408"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.7633"},"all_hashtags":["GOP"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

I withheld comment on impeachment out of deference to Mueller’s work and his professionalism. But now we have the report, and it’s shocking. Mueller found a ton of corruption: 34 guilty pleas or indictments of individuals and companies. Five of Trump’s highest-level associates pleaded guilty to serious felonies, including his campaign chairman, personal lawyer, and national security advisor. The Trump campaign was willing and eager to work with a foreign adversary to interfere in our elections. This is far more significant wrongdoing even than the Watergate break-in and its subsequent cover-up which led to Nixon’s impeachment and resignation. The report also details 10 instances of obstruction of justice by the president, while in office. Over 1,000 former federal prosecutors from both political parties said this evidence is enough to support prosecution and conviction on felony obstruction of justice charges. https://t.co/lWYmYwgllE Mueller himself said he did NOT exonerate the president. He felt he could not prosecute Trump because of a DOJ rule against indicting a sitting president. He made it clear it's up to Congress to take further action. Given the record presented, we are duty-bound to proceed. The Constitution provides that the president “shall be removed from Office, on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Nobody disputes that felony obstruction of justice is a “high crime” under the Constitution. Impeachment is not a redo of the election. Voters accepted a lot that I found appalling: mocking the disabled, childish name calling, attacking war heroes and Gold Star families, insulting Muslims and Mexicans. But while this behavior is abhorrent, it is for voters to judge. We’ve seen terrible policies from Trump: dangerous foreign policy, tariffs that hurt Americans, reckless tax cuts, cruelty toward asylum-seekers, and attempts to rip health care from millions. I disagree with Trump's policies, but they're for elections, not impeachment. Impeachment is not about the president’s character or policies. It’s about upholding the rule of law and defending the Constitution. It’s about whether he has broken the law. The Mueller Report contains plenty of evidence that he did. Hearings may produce more such evidence. Some argue impeachment poses a political risk for Democrats. They say Republicans will claim Trump was vindicated regardless of the outcome. That gives Americans too little credit. I trust them to discern which of us did our patriotic duty and who played to political cynicism. We should never pursue impeachment for political reasons. Nor should we avoid it for political reasons. It’s Congress’ job to determine whether the president broke the law and acted against the interests of the United States. If we don’t act, we send the message that criminal behavior is normal for presidents. Trump will be more emboldened to ignore Congress. And we will increase cynicism among those who depend on us to uphold the law and the Constitution. None of that is acceptable. @justinamash is right: “The risk we face in an environment of extreme partisanship is not that Congress will employ [impeachment] as a remedy too often but rather that Congress will employ it so rarely that it cannot deter misconduct...\" https://t.co/PkhS2aiBTM @justinamash \"Our system of checks and balances relies on each branch jealously guarding its powers and upholding its duties under our Constitution. When loyalty to a political party or to an individual trumps loyalty to the Constitution, the Rule of Law–the foundation of liberty–crumbles.” @justinamash Democrats are leading on the problems facing Americans: health care, ethics in government, comprehensive immigration reform and border security, gun safety, and civil rights. We must continue to pass groundbreaking legislation, as we have, and as we were elected to do. @justinamash And now we are assigned another solemn task by the Constitution and by current events. We need to begin impeachment hearings.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1135486501"},"id_str":"1135486501","name":"Rep.

You can send Mr Julian #Assange a money order of up to £250.00, out of which he will be allowed £15.50 a week for in prison purchases and this: phone calls... 2. You must make the money order out to HM PRISON SERVICES 3. Mail the money order in an envelope addressed to: Mr Julian Assange DOB 03/07/1971 HMP Belmarsh Western Way London SE28 0EB 4. You must write on the money order your name and address, most important! Also, ensure you write for Mr Julian Assange’s Account DOB 03/07/1971 on the actual money order. 5. If you wish to send him books or items of clothing (no logos allowed) one can post them/have them delivered in the first 28 days after his conviction. But you can only send books to him via WH Smith or Waterstones, NOT Amazon. Again his name and DOB 03/07/1971 must in the address details. As it is near to the 28 days since his conviction, the only way thereafter that he can receive books or allowed items is to deliver them in person yourself to the prison reception according to the following schedule: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays both morning and afternoons: Morning: between 9:15 to 10:15 Afternoon: between 14:15 to 15:15 Fridays Mornings only: between 9:15 to 10:15 Sunday Afternoons only: between 14:15 to 15:15 Saturdays and Mondays... this service is not available. 6. He is not allowed stamps to be sent. You can write to him in the prescribed manner including a stamped self-addressed envelope for your own personal reply, but your name and address on the reply envelope must be in ink... , not pencil. He is not allowed stamps or stationary etc from outside sources but must buy the items from the prison shop itself. 7. The prison receptionists I spoke to were most helpful and pleasant. They said to please phone for any further information. My comment is they will answer your questions but will not give any other information unless directly asked. I had to phone back for the specific HMP Prison name to be written on the money order, ie HM Prison Services with one's name and address to be written on it and Julian Assange's name and DOB: 03/07/1971, to ensure he gets the money order's amount credited into his prison account. When asking how to get money to him without having his prison number they did not tell me this, they just said a money order could be sent. I had to phone back as I did not think to ask this at the time of my first phone call for the correct name to be put on the money order. He is not allowed to receive postal orders or money directly. 8. All letters to him are read before he receives them. The best way to write to him and send him a letter and card to cheer him up is to send it in an unsealed envelope... addressed to him, inside a sealed envelope addressed to him at the HMP Belmarsh Prison address above. 9. Online Payment: One cannot send any money to Julian Assange online unless one has his prison number for the prison service’s computer to correctly assign that payment to his specific prison account. The only way you can obtain his prison number is to write to him, and if he replies with it you can pay him that way. But the money order method is better, as really only close friends and family should have access to his prison number. Please copy and paste the above to other YouTube videos whose subject is Julian Assange as he needs our support.\" Many thanks to Pam K for sending me thie above. Let's make sure there is a deluge of books for Julian to read, and enough money for him to make phonecalls in his commissary! #Unity4J #Assange #HMPBelmarsh #ProtectJulian #FreeAssange To clarify: He can only have 3 books at a time so not sure if many people should send him books. But on the other hand, how bad would it be if 3 tonnes of books turned up on Belmarsh Prison's doorstep to show how much support he has? #FreeAssange","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"358443316"},"id_str":"358443316","name":"Gordon Dimmack","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"3699"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"601"},"created_at":"Fri Aug 19 23:02:22 +0000 2011","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"6844"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"17"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"733"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1443"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"5"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"43"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"85"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.94407"},"all_hashtags":["Assange","Unity4J","HMPBelmarsh","ProtectJulian","FreeAssange"],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Anger","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

Is it possible to provide stable supply to the country without San Geronimo B? “Impossible,” said @SoyJoseAguilar The La Horqueta substation in Villa de Cura, which sends Guri’s power to Valencia and onwards west via San Geronimo was also down Sunday. This is very bad news for Western Venezuela. They are last in line. https://t.co/M22OFYaClc San Geronimo B is not working because it’s not getting sufficient (if any) current from Guri. That’s the scariest part. It provides evidence that the government is far from successfully restarting its turbines. What caused the Guri failure? Corpoelec union leader Ali Briceño said it was brush fire under the 765 KV trunkline which caused a surge in the system and caused Guri to shut down. There are no skilled operators left there to restart it. It did happen before. No one is cutting grass or maintaining fire breaks under the trunkline. https://t.co/d4mvgqp7VB Briceno’s theory is “possible but not probably,” said one of the people who built that trunkline. Fire would’ve had to occur in a relatively small stretch, between Guri &amp; the first 765 KV substation, Malena, for that to happen. There are also three parallel 765 KV lines running at a distance from each other. Unlikely the fire would’ve affected them all. Most people I talked to say the problem had to occur inside Guri’s turbines themselves. And that’s a scary thought. If they are damaged, they will be very hard to replace or repair. No money or skilled people. One Corpoelec manager said after the blackout a Guri operator told him “the turbines are failing,” before hanging up. He hasn’t been able to reach anyone there since. Sebin is a constant menace. And without Guri, it’s Mad Max. The government’s failure to present a coherent explanation is only raising my fears that something really bad has happened. First it was industrial sabotage, then it was cyber attack. Government has already cancelled classes Monday and @vladimirpadrino said “there’s still a lot to do” Sunday. These are not signs of imminent solution to this nightmare.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1017609582"},"id_str":"1017609582","name":"Anatoly Kurmanaev","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"34883"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1002"},"created_at":"Mon Dec 17 14:47:00 +0000 2012","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"4034"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"17"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"16273"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"13360"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"957"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"786"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.13529"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

Here’s a look. https://t.co/aAhjVQSQQo (3) @christinawilkie uses the word “cult” about the MEK, a phrase used specifically by the Iranian regime &amp; those who promote a soft, appeasement approach with Tehran. We saw how Obama’s disastrous policies allowed #Iran wreak havoc across the Middle East... (4) Who else uses the word “cult” for the MEK? The @NYTimes, of course. https://t.co/3p82DMTTw2 (5) Here’s something I think you might find interesting about the @NYTimes’ ties with #Iran’s regime, explaining why the NYT would resort to publishing such pieces against the Iranian opposition MEK. https://t.co/8ggXa3lpB6 (6) Moving on. @christinawilkie says the Obama White House viewed the MEK as a foreign terrorist org. Here’s some history about the MEK being blacklisted as a terrorist organization. https://t.co/nae052AUzT https://t.co/UgZwz1bOnP (7) @christinawilkie also talks about “well-paid MEK supporters like John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani” … I recommend this excellent read by @ProfRTanter. https://t.co/HvH7oSt2K4 https://t.co/7LLhI9eqh1 (8) @christinawilkie herself has a history with the MEK. Her writing about the MEK can be dated as far back as 2012, where she admitted their delisting was “a good decision.” #Hypocrisy https://t.co/gWZOO0QvEP https://t.co/E7Gitqywpd (9) In Dec 2017, @christinawilkie again describes the MEK as a “terrorist organization” in another Huff Post piece. Another case of #Hypocrisy. https://t.co/QxsExEQHXv (10) I don’t know about you, but if you ask me, @christinawilkie is showing the signs of a writer being paid by #Iran to demonize the mullahs’ opposition. (11) Here’s @christinawilkie sinking to the low of praising #Iran’s President @HassanRouhani during the Obama years. #Shame https://t.co/L73bNrqLlB (12) Again @christinawilkie sinking to the low of praising #Iran’s President @HassanRouhani. This time more recently. #Shame https://t.co/xUmMUx3yex (13) And here’s @christinawilkie sinking to another low of praising #Iran’s FM @JZarif. #Shame https://t.co/4Dxa2RMV9C (14) What #Iran’s regime &amp; @christinawilkie (whom I believe is being paid by Tehran) are really worried about is the MEK gaining credibility. Here’s the U.S. Justice Department explaining how the Iranian regime is specifically targeting the MEK. https://t.co/PERm45PD45 (15) You might find this thread helpful on how #Iran’s regime is deeply concerned about the MEK, allocating espionage resources to specifically gather information on the organization &amp; their supporters. https://t.co/acawvwnrSz (16) To make a long story short, I find it hard to believe someone would defend a murderous regime with no incentive!

So many of the accusations against Zito are basically “I can’t believe someone said this.” They also can’t believe trump won. But he did. She addresses the meat of the accusations here: https://t.co/PGxBM3aHfK Zito was one of the only people who predicted a Trump win. She did it by talking to A LOT of people. Did she know one of the thousand people she interviewed ran for a local office ten years prior? I don’t think that’s a fair expectation. But there’s nothing about this that’s fair. Zito gives voice to people a lot of folks would rather pretend don’t exist. More of the meat of the accusations: https://t.co/ns7huuGOY5 A woman drives a lot. She stops for gas. She talks to people. That’s her job. She describes the interactions. A lot of the folks have similar complaints. It’s why a lot voted differently. So one writer describes the individual complaints. They are bound to sound similar to each other when they are similar and written by the same writer.

Said he knew nothing about Bush torture &amp; rendition. But: was emailed talking points. https://t.co/7Xvud9M6hS https://t.co/Yv8c4UTnZq Republican superlawyer Bill Burck, who simultaneously represents Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and Don McGahn in their dealings with the Russia probe, is also brokering access to Kavanaugh documents for the Senate. He's keeping a *very* tight lid on them. https://t.co/uUHpJSqx6D https://t.co/beyMcw1cQO Grassley &amp; Burck made deal where, of the few Kavanaugh papers that the Senate does receive, tons are labeled \"committee confidential\"—meaning the 79 senators *not* on the Judiciary committee don't get to see them. Collins &amp; Murkowski aren't on committee. https://t.co/8oF1bHAXT1 The \"committee confidential\" documents contain more evidence that Kavanaugh, under oath, said things that weren't true when, after serving in W's White House, he went through confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship. Perjury? Dunno. Profoundly concerning? For damn sure. https://t.co/9eWDTHsibV As Sens. Feinstein, Leahy, &amp; Durbin wrote to Grassley today, \"These are serious questions that could easily be addressed if we were given access to his records.\" But the National Archives practice is only respond to Committee Chairs. Like... Grassley. https://t.co/NZTycDwSa0 https://t.co/19Jyv1xpcB Note: within even the subset of Kavanaugh records that Grassley has requested from the National Archives, many won't be ready until late October—potentially *after* the confirmation vote. The docs discussed in this thread are coming through Burck's separate process. https://t.co/oICSchwVvM Dems have filed Freedom of Information Act requests to try to get at the mountain of unreleased Kavanaugh documents. If that doesn't work, they announced today, they'll file suit. If that doesn't work, GOP lawyer Bill Burck gets to decide what comes out. https://t.co/Vf63qTYwty So, to wrap up here: The GOP is going to elaborate lengths to hide Kavanaugh's papers. The few that *have* come out raise serious problems. If you follow Democratic senators on Twitter, you'll see the hashtags #WhatAreTheyHiding and #ReleaseTheRecords over and over. This is why. Addendum: This video pretty much sums it up. #ReleaseTheRecords #WhatAreTheyHiding #ThisIsRidiculous https://t.co/8BatCAlXfy So, you want to help #stopKavanaugh? Here’s what to do. First, call your senators. *All* of them need more call volume. They think we’re not paying attention. 202-224-3121. Then DM “Court” to @resistbot. Then head to https://t.co/rQe4nsZfWn &amp; find your nearest protest on Aug 26. There’s a rolling wave of #StopKavanaugh protests happening week to week. Get involved. But definitely, definitely mark your calendar for 8/26. That’s the big bag; more than 100 demonstrations simultaneously nationwide. None near you? Register your own. https://t.co/8uUgBh9Q5U. What’s the path to victory? Clearest one hasn’t changed since since the moment Kavanaugh was nominated. Here’s my speech from that night, outside the Supreme Court. It boils down to Collins and Murkowski. Mainers and Alaskans, your country needs you. https://t.co/NMmU0BiX3f If you’re not a Mainer or an Alaskan, though, don’t think for a minute that your voice doesn’t matter. We need noise and energy *everywhere,* so Dems know to unite &amp; fight (several are dangerously on the fence!) and Republicans get nervous. That creates room for Collins &amp; Murk. In the fight against Kavanaugh, we shouldn’t kid ourselves that victory is at hand, or even likely. But we also shouldn’t give in to the cop-out of despair. Things can change fast in these fights. If something explosive comes to light, we want it to be the final exploding straw. In other words, pressure now sets the stage for new revelations or hearing fireworks to actually matter. If there’s no pressure beforehand, new stuff can’t tip the balance. It’s our job to push as far as possible given today’s conditions, so that tomorrow’s could prove decisive. And as you work on all of this, don’t forget the stakes. https://t.co/xW4ipC5mzC There’s a little sparkle of irony in the fact that it was Harriet Miers—the most recent failed SCOTUS nominee—who emailed the torture talking points to Kavanaugh, two years before he said under oath that he knew nothing about the policy.

Even AFTER THE ELECTION WAS OVER. We got this SpyGate fiasco that dwarfs Watergate by a factor of 10 because FBI officials *insisted* on disguising propaganda handed to them by paid political operatives as being intel intercepts coming from intelligence agencies. https://t.co/UTLKUosaXg Nixon was going to be impeached for helping to cover up the Watergate break-in and for *talking* about using fed agencies to go after his political enemies [such as using the IRS to give them 'tax problems']. He escaped impeachment only by resigning first. Here we have an admission that the heads of federal LEO and Intel agencies actively moved against a sitting President using POLITICALLY TAINTED PROPAGANDA that was coming straight from a political comms shop working for the Clintons and the DNC. Remember the timeline here: the FBI made a *show* of severing all ties with Fusion GPS's Glenn Simpson &amp; Christopher Steele shortly before the 2016 Presidential election. This had to be done when it was becoming obvious Steele had shopped this 'evidence' to the news media. REAL intelligence reports containing REAL classified evidence that is being used by the FBI for REAL criminal/counterintel investigations can't shopped by REAL intelligence agents to various news outlets trying to get them to publish it. Especially while investigation's ongoing. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT FUSION GPS'S SIMPSON AND STEELE WERE DOING. They were handing their 'evidence' to BOTH the FBI *and* THE NEWS MEDIA at the SAME TIME. So shortly before the 2016 election, the FBI supposedly 'cut ties' with Fusion &amp; quit paying Steele as a contractor. But this severing of ties with Fusion *wasn't real*! Instead, McCabe &amp; Strzok set up a secret backchannel using DOJ's DAAG Bruce Ohr - they had Simpson &amp; Steele go meet with Ohr &amp; then had Ohr come to the FBI to be debriefed by SSA Joseph Pientka. So from shortly before the election, all the way through Comey's firing in May 2017 and beyond, McCabe &amp; Strzok &amp; other SpyGate plotters were still accessing/using the fake Trump/Russia 'evidence' being passed to them from Fusion GPS. McCabe is being FORCED to make this admission on 60 Minutes because he knows Horowitz and Huber have the goods on him. Baker, Lisa Pages &amp; others gave away the plot in their testimony. Rosenstein is going to be one of the witnesses against him. So is Jeff Sessions. McCabe's only play at this point is to claim he was doing what he thought was the best for the country because he was convinced the 'evidence' he was being shown that Trump was a Russian stooge was REAL. But it wasn't real. And there will be evidence that Horowitz and Huber have compiled that will SHOW that McCabe along with Comey &amp; Strzok &amp; Brennan &amp; Clapper and John McCain all *knew* this Trump/Russia 'evidence' was fake &amp; being created for the Clintons. Keep watching. This is only going to get BETTER as it goes on. https://t.co/og5q1GekUw ADDENDUM: of *course* McCabe is trying to impeach Rosenstein as a witness, claiming he was 1 of the main members of this coup attempt. Guess who 1 of the biggest witnesses against Comey &amp; McCabe &amp; Strzok is going to be at their trials? This is not hard. Narratives based on Trump leaving Rosenstein there because he's blind or stupid or blackmailed or intimidated or whatever are stupid beyond belief. And yet...and yet people still bring them to me every day. It's amazing. \"I'm sorry but I think Rosenstein is dirty....\" Great! Explain why Trump hasn't fired him or why Sessions/Whitaker didn't remove him. Go!

The Report says it went to the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. Didn't you wonder where Nader was? Zamel? Cambridge Analytica? Transition meetings with Saudi intelligence? 1/ U.S. counterintelligence has intel at a minimum at the PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE standard of proof that part of the Trump campaign's contract with Cambridge Analytica was a subcontract for \"dark\" intelligence gathering with Psy-Group—which Trump let the EMIRATIS pay for. 2/ Moreover, U.S. counterintelligence has further intel at the PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE standard of proof—at a minimum—that the Emirati emissary working with Psy-Group was in REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE KREMLIN while his Psy-Group partner was in CONTACT WITH NETANYAHU'S OFFICE. 3/ Trump Jr. knows what he did. And the lawyer who's represented BOTH Don AND Psy-Group knows what he did. And Alexander Nix and Mark Turnbull of Cambridge Analytica know what THEY did. You're going to learn eventually why the Trumps want you to be upset about the Steele dossier. 4/ The evidence we have shows it is more likely than not that the Trump campaign—in coordination with four foreign governments—received illegal foreign donations during the campaign to run a PROPAGANDA and INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING campaign it didn't want to have traced to it. Ever. 5/ There's a reason that Gates and Nader play a smaller role in the Mueller Report than makes any sense at all, and that Zamel hardly appears. There's a reason there's almost nothing on the UAE or Saudi Arabia in a narrative of events that those countries were swept up in fully. 6/ Of *course* McConnell wants the obstruction probe shut down—but the media is wrong if it thinks that's his biggest concern. He can fight that war if he has to. What he wants us to conclude is the COLLUSION story is over. It hasn't even started. Why? It's an INTELLIGENCE issue. 7/ So: (1) 20% of the Mueller Report's \"collusion\" narrative is REDACTED. (2) The 80% left is TEN PERCENT of the counterintelligence intel on collusion. (3) We therefore have a FRACTION of the \"collusion\" intel. (4) The standard for \"collusion\" is PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. 8/ Because journalists are trained (understandably) to report only the info they have, but also (far less understandably) to pretend that the information they have is *all* the information you need and/or should expect to ever get, we're thinking we know a story that... we don't. 9/ The odd part: I know what I know—and have included what I've included in PROOF OF CONSPIRACY—not because I have sources major media doesn't. I don't. I have this intel for two reasons: (1) I read media from around the world. (2) I read *old* media—stories people thought dead. 10/ I don't have theories. I have information already held by FBI counterintelligence and foreign media— and, at that, likely only a fraction of what the former has. But unlike major media, foreign media or FBI counterintelligence, I'm going to publish the full story all at once. PS/ It's coming soon; it'll be just what I say; and anyone who read PROOF OF COLLUSION will know I don't mess around—my research is accurate and meticulously sourced. I hope we get a full COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT eventually. Until then, there'll be this: https://t.co/YBrqfTtZ4Q NOTE/ Trump has lately turned US policy on its head across the board. On the Muslim Brotherhood. On Yemen. On Khalifa Hifter—the Libyan warlord Trump now supports because MBS does. On Syria. On Russian human rights reports. Sounds like different stories: it's not. It's one story. NOTE2/ America's foreign policy is no longer America's foreign policy: it's a fully bought and paid for subsidiary of the ambitions of 5 countries: Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, and Egypt. I'm not speaking euphemistically—there's *no American-owned foreign policy right now*. NOTE3/ There's not a man or woman in the CIA tracking what I'm speaking of who would disagree with anything I've said. It'd be impossible to disagree with—it's fully sourced. It sounds odd only because it's not part of the national conversation. But eventually it'll *have* to be. NOTE4/ My sources (a few among hundreds): NYT The Washington Post The Wall Street Journal Reuters The New Yorker ProPublica The Guardian BBC The Times of Israel Haaretz The Jerusalem Post Al Jazeera Al Arabiya The Moscow Times Kathimerini (Greece) *Zero theories. All evidence.* NOTE5/ These criminals will be caught—or, at a minimum, caught *out*. But I'm not going to predict when, because I have no idea when. Nor can I predict by whom in our government they'll be caught out, as so far no one is enough of a patriot to take the professional risk involved.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"3223426134"},"id_str":"3223426134","name":"Seth Abramson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"676351"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"38"},"created_at":"Fri May 22 16:19:26 +0000 2015","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"53065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"17"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"17666"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"50208"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1039"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"2953"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"2.25011"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Surprise","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

Judge: “It left the impression that the issue was left in the pleading for public consumption, but not mine.” p.16 On the $125k payment toward Manafort’s legal fees... Judge: “The record doesn’t seem to reflect confusion and the defendant didn’t profess to be confused. He does appear, though, to be making a concerted effort to avoid saying what really took place.” p.23 On that same $125k payment... Judge: “I find this was a matter about which he provided intentionally false information to the Office of Special Counsel, the FBI, and the grand jury. I also note — without deciding whether I have to make this finding or not —... “... that the record supports a finding that the Office of Special Counsel’s interest in tracing the flow of funds to Manafort particularly from REDACTED and vendors associated with the campaign, was material to this investigation.” p. 26 On Manafort attesting as to Kilimnik’s state of mind... Judge: “I think it’s also fair to say that advancing that version was not just relaying what Kilimnik said, it appears to be an attempt to exonerate him.” p. 27 “This is an example of a situation in which the OSC legitimately concluded he’s lying to minimize things here... This is a problematic attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability and it gives rise to legitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.” p.30 On what the judge describes as Manafort’s “pattern” of “dissembling” about Kilimnik: Judge: “Denying the meeting REDACTED was denying a contact that was part of what the Office of Special Counsel was investigating.” p.40 Judge: “We’ve now spent considerable time talking about multiple clusters of false or misleading or incomplete or needed-to-be-prodded-by-counsel statements, all of which center around the defendant’s relationship or communications with Mr. Kilimnik”... “... This is a topic at the undisputed core of the Special Counsel’s investigation into — as paragraph B of the appointment order put it — ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign.’ Mr. Kilimnik... “...doesn’t have to be in the government or even be an active spy to be a link.” p. 41 This is new. This suggests the mysterious “other” DOJ investigation Manafort lied about is an investigation that also relates to the Trump campaign: Judge: “Defendant suggests that it’s not really that important because it wasn’t about his own wrongdoing...” “... I’m not sure I buy that because the point of seeking cooperation from a person at the highest level of the campaign was to obtain accurate information about the acts of others, in particular what transpired REDACTED. So it’s very troubling to me.” p.44 On the (apparently campaign related) other DOJ investigation Manafort lied about... Judge: “The evidence suggests that he decided to obscure what had taken place to shield possibly Mr. REDACTED. This withholding of facts, this begrudging behavior...” “...advancing a new version that’s less inculpatory of REDACTED was significant enough to set off alarm bells with his own lawyers.” And then starting on p.50 a whole bunch of pages that look like this: https://t.co/aFQPMWsvhy And then one last intrigue on p.66: Judge: “All right. I just have one question for my public minute order. The REDACTED, the fact that REDACTED is still sealed. So I should not use that in my minute order, is that correct?” Both sides agree, correct.

It's built around a 2003 study on “fragmentation” and its effects on GDP growth and governance quality https://t.co/cwBWdq1G82 1.5 I will accept for the purpose of this thread that the way to measure “strength” in the stupid battle over whether diversity is Canada's is purely economically, in terms of contribution to GDP, because us immigrants are only desirable if we're hard workers, or whatever 2 Let's start with \"fragmentation.\" Mintz provides two definitions. One is in the context of the data he presents in this table. (Also, raw GDP over GDP per capita, which he uses elsewhere? Ew). It’s “measured according to shares of ethnic and linguistic groups in a country\" https://t.co/iS6j4FfEsG 3 Actually, the study itself defines it as “the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to different groups.” So basically the presence of more groups, or a large number of people from group two onwards, means fractionalization 4 Mintz's in-text definition is “when citizens identify more strongly with a social group rather than the nation as a whole.” Guessing he meant this as a paraphrase. BUT it assumes that people who are from group two+ (you might call us \"immigrants\") ID more with group than nation https://t.co/mMs9UhNAzK 5 And in the case of Canada at least, that's not true! The opposite in fact. Polling from Frank Graves and EKOS in this piece: Over the last 20 yrs, amidst a big increase in non-European immigrants, national identity is constant. Ethnic attachment is down https://t.co/dI9vqbu5aJ 5.5 This reflects the raw total of people immigrating, not in relation to the population, of which first-year residents have been a higher share in previous years. Also reflects an increasing share of immigrants being non-European since some racist policies were lifted 6 To restate: Canadians have not been identifying \"more strongly with a social group rather than the nation as a whole\" even as \"the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to different groups\" increased. Defns of \"fragmentation\" contradict 7 This matters, Mintz says, because at the ballot box people act for the good of everyone if they associate more with the country as a whole than their own identity group. Implicitly that leads to worse economic policy and governance—I guess; he doesn't quite complete the thought https://t.co/hpsk4TQcGD 8 Also, Mintz says, if our \"ethnic fragmentation\" was as low as the U.S., we'd add 0.4 points to GDP growth! This seems to be his extrapolation from the data and formulas, because I can't find that specific calculation in the study https://t.co/U70KSWnk4z 8.5 The study is here, by the way: https://t.co/SiEtQVeZkO 9 Also, the data that he cites in the piece to show that Canada is \"ethnically fragmented\"—we're a 0.7124—is from a 2003 study. That's 15 years ago! You know what's happened in that time? Lots, including most of the active period of the trends Graves identified, cited above 10 Okay, Murad, get to the point already. Mintz's prescription is that politicians should propose ideas for \"reinforcing our national identity\" to avoid \"all the risks that fragmentation can bring.\" As I've shown above, he hasn't actually proved that these risks apply to Canada! https://t.co/kKzO3tEABa 11 Also, what \"national identity\" would that be? Think about Canadian-ness. People can have different definitions—is attending bhangra night, regardless of your race, included in yours? What matters is that people identify with Canadian-ness, not what it is. Which they do! 11.5 This, by the way, is only in terms of the logic of this piece. I have some serious definitional and historical problems with the concept of a \"national identity\" inherently, a Canadian one more so 12 If the only way to make diversity our \"strength\" is economic, shouldn't Mintz be calling on politicians to help immigrants get credentials recognized or lift barriers to employment from distrust of foreign work experience or even, maybe, racism? That would contribute to GDP 13 But you see, that would require Mintz to be doing something more than what is essentially throw some misused numbers into an article-length version of the \"banal bromides and Twitter tirades\" he wants to see less of 14 It's almost like discussions of whether or not \"diversity is our strength\" rarely yield anything useful because it's never raised in good faith, and confirmation bias abounds","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"42463141"},"id_str":"42463141","name":"Murad Hemmadi","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"2187"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1520"},"created_at":"Mon May 25 18:55:45 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"3201"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"18"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"54"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"198"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"11"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.79865"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

It's more urgent to post and share this given the attack on #Q on the Great Awakening board this afternoon. The attack confirms that my assessment that #QAnon is over the target is, in fact, on target. 2/ The question of #QAnon being a LARP has been debated, but there's huge evidence that #Q is real and very directly tied to #POTUS. Many, I believe correctly, speculate that Q is military intelligence (possibly #GeneralFlynn) or at least uses this for some sourcing. 3/ Recently, a YouTube channel \"American Intelligence Media\" (AIM) claimed that Q is a LARP/#Psyop. This was upsetting to many as it has seemed that #AIM is dedicated to exposing the cabal and the #DeepState, w/a rightfully-heavy focus on the #SeniorExecutiveService (#SES). 4/ The recent push by #AIM about the #SES may have caused AIM to be targeted. How do we interpret the claims by AIM? 5/ Here is my analysis: There are many factors that serve to debunk the #AIM video that tries to debunk #QAnon as legit, namely: a. They claim that @jerome_corsi says he has communicated directly w/#Q. This is absolutely not true. 6/ b. They claim that #QAnon contacted them directly. Q said he would engage in \"No comms privately w/ anyone.\"[...] 7/ c. They claim that #Q could NOT be a close insider since the release of the info would be a national security violation that would put them in jail. This is NOT THE CASE if it is a true insider w/authorization from #POTUS, who can declassify ANYTHING. 8/ d. They falsely claim #Q has not shown confirmations w/in 3 weeks of predictions. This is easily disproven by the dozens of confirmations of Q…of connections to #POTUS (tweets, images from Air Force One, pen at Camp David, \"chain of command,\" hand gestures in speeches, etc.) 9/ …and of foreknowledge of events (BDT bomber, Hawaiian missile alert, NK deal, use of Omnibus deal to fund building the wall via Army Corps of Engineers). Look at 3/23 post https://t.co/WXPoHas6kU vis-à-vis #POTUS' 3/25 tweet https://t.co/vHd4LYeYop 10/ e.

They also claim specific knowledge that #Sessions (\"we won't reveal what we have on him\") is compromised but will not disclose it. 11/g. They claim that the current Q is anti-Semitic…based on WHAT evidence?? h. #AIM also specifically attacks other channels that are clearly on the side of patriots and truth. This is a classic \"divide and conquer\" strategy of the #Clowns. 12/ i. They claim to \"be smarter than the public\" (having solved the \"puzzle\" in minutes) and to have been invited into #Q's Club. This behavior is 100% contrary to the Q movement (\"Where we go one, we go ALL\"), displaying the very \"elitism\" that we are fighting. 13/ In case it helps, they claim the #puzzle they solved is encrypted in this message: \"Eagles rain fire on the Canaanite as the merchant of wine challenges Sirus. The sword of Lilly joins forces with Jacob's adopted children.\" 14/ j. The idea that #Q was shut down by the cabal, who took control for a psyop, w/o making an effort to communicate this fact over many months is ludicrous. Also, it is hubris by #AIM to think that Q would target a relatively small YT channel w/60K subscribers. 15/ k. Important to remember: #Q warned us that \"they want you DIVIDED.\" The logical conclusion is either that #AIM is a #disnifo/#psyop channel or that it has been compromised. 16/ I believe that the latter interpretation is more likely based on their prior history, especially given the events that happened on the #8chan board a few hours ago. They were either threatened or have been trapped by their own arrogance into their current assessment. 17/ To conclude, all evidence...the many confirmations and the escalating attacks on #Q and efforts at division of #Patriots...point to #QAnon being a legit insider source providing real intel. 19/ The recent disinfo campaign and direct attack on #QAnon's GA board today compel us to analyze. Please retweet/comment to engage a vigorous analysis/discussion. Our goal should be the #Truth and not to prove an embedded position. /END","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"749684424"},"id_str":"749684424","name":"#RedOctober-ArrestsAreImminent","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"3739"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3936"},"created_at":"Fri Aug 10 16:56:32 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"6833"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"18"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"800"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1946"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"17"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"44"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"108"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.77753"},"all_hashtags":["QAnon","Q","POTUS","GeneralFlynn","Psyop","AIM","DeepState","SeniorExecutiveService","SES","Sessions","Clowns","puzzle","disnifo","psyop","8chan","Patriots","Truth"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

(thread) https://t.co/D6qirFASmf First, 6 million Jewish people were slaughtered out of anti-Semitic hatred, but 17 million people total were systematically murdered. This included persons with disabilities, Roma, Jehovah's Witnesses, LGBTQ folks, and other groups. Don't erase that. (image: @HolocaustMuseum) https://t.co/xcXMJTMv8L For several years, there was a popular exhibit at @HolocaustMuseum called “Some Were Neighbors”. It meant to highlight how the Third Reich would not have come about without the complicity of civilians. Ordinary folks. Neighbors. The genius of the “Some Were Neighbors” exhibit is that it didn’t hold back. It talks about how doctors, lawyers, teachers, police officers—upstanding citizens—directly sold out their friends and neighbors (Jewish + others). Specific stories. Brutal stories. Violence + betrayal. Throughout the exhibit were examples of real people who may have not worn Nazi armbands but turned-in Jewish folks, often unnecessarily. Some participated in violence. Most participated in discrimination. Just ordinary people, not Nazi party hacks, behaving ruthlessly. There was no subtlety about the exhibit. The message was clear: these people are just like you, just like your friends and family, and they viciously bought into Nazi ideals. Their ears and tongues did the bulk of the legwork in rounding up Jews and others to be exterminated. And they were led to do this by vicious propaganda that downplayed the atrocities taking place. The German civilian population was held to a party line that Jews and others were simply being \"relocated\" to \"labor camps\". Questioning this would get you killed. The lack of transparency at the time about these camps is devastating, and instead of accountability on human rights, the vast majority of people did nothing and enabled shaming and violence toward those who wanted answers. You know what we did in America, @Liz_Cheney? Part of the main exhibit at @HolocaustMuseum is how we turned away Jewish refugees at our shore who were fleeing persecution in Germany and elsewhere. We turned them away, sending them to their deaths. We knew Jews were being persecuted. “What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. . . . We must speak out.” —Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, March 1933 The headline below is an American newspaper in '33. https://t.co/2DOLIgpIo9 In fact, as @HolocaustMuseum points out, American diplomats knew Jews and others were being targeted. We did nothing... until Americans were attacked in Germany in 1933. Hitler promised our diplomats that would end, and that was somehow good enough for us. This goes on for years. Stories of Jews and others being brutalized, rounded up, and put in \"work camps\", never to be heard from again. We knew about this because our leading newspapers reported it. Many of our citizens protested, but our government did nothing. Two full years before Pearl Harbor, American Nazis held a mass rally at Madison Square Garden in NYC. Over 20,000 packed the venue and yelled \"Heil Hitler!\" There were summer camps in the U.S. where American children wore Hitler Youth uniforms and marched with Nazi banners. https://t.co/3gW1HtyTaT There were able to do this, in part, because of people who diminished crimes against humanity, who constantly engaged in bad faith with reports of violence and discrimination against marginalized people. \"It can't be that bad. You're overreacting\", they said. It was, and no. Three months later, the MS St. Louis, carrying 937 Jews, attempts to land at Cuba. They were refused entry and came to the U.S., where our officials, by this point, were well aware of the atrocities. Just 937 souls. And we turned them away. A quarter of them were killed in camps. https://t.co/Ggkrc0YMFt You need to understand, Congresswoman @Liz_Cheney, that the Holocaust happened over a long period of time, abated by the persistent excuses of those in power to do something. Out of fear. Out of selfishness. Out of bigotry. When Congresswoman @AOC refers to these places near the border as \"concentration camps\", where protocol is still secret and obfuscated, where abuses and unnecessary death have been documented, where children still live in seemingly intentional awful conditions, she's right. I would encourage you to visit the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Congresswoman @Liz_Cheney. You may find its content far more useful than as a vehicle to make a cheap political point while our government under Trump commits horrific atrocities against innocents. /thread","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"15907183"},"id_str":"15907183","name":"Charlotte Clymer🏳️‍🌈","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"219647"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3773"},"created_at":"Tue Aug 19 18:00:06 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"131321"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"18"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"38662"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"210624"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2148"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"11701"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.16713"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

And I did and one of them said: \"Can we pray for you?\" I asked them why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk around the streets of D.C. and let God's voice tell them who might be broken or otherwise need prayer. She literally used the word \"broken\". Now... I'm a Christian, and I'm not opposed to prayer or people praying specifically for me when done in good faith. But I was dressed femme as hell today with gorgeous makeup and earrings, and I sure as hell caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer. And I thought: let's do this. And I so asked their spokesperson if she understood how it might look to be searching for \"broken\" people to pray for and specifically pick out a random transgender person on the street to offer prayer. And they looked more than taken aback. So, I stood up, with what passed for a smile barely concealing my annoyance with this situation, and I asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. And their eyes go wide and the guy on the right starts nervously stammering in front of me in front of this cafe. It's clear he's having trouble answering the question, as are the other two, so ambushed are they that the \"broken\" transgender person is asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew, and I wait for a few seconds more than what is comfortable to answer. \"You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus' name, there He is with us.\" And they stare blankly at me because they have tiptoed with their condescending, passive-aggressive bullshit straight into a brick wall, and I have no intention of going easy. \"That is what Matthew says, is it not?\" And one of them says \"yes, that's right\", and they don't understand that the verse is commonly misused as a prayer for intercession rather than its true purpose as a prayer of accountability. And here, today, I shall bring accountability. I have had it up to here with Evangelicals sticking their noses into how my humanity is defined, and I will be damned if they're going to interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn't bothering them. \"So, let's pray.\" And they nervously step forward into a circle. I say to one of them: \"You start us off.\" And she does. It is quick and antiseptic because they, the three of them, want to get the hell away from this awkward situation. And then I pick it up when it's clear she's done. \"Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends...\" and I'm quite honest with God about how I hope She'll bless my new friends w/ a priority for affirmation and inclusion of others. That their community will honor all as God made them and value the strength of diversity. And I specifically mention the natural beauty of the LGBTQ community and thank God again for making us as we exist, and I throw-in there a genuine wish that their trip back home is a safe one and wrap the prayer up in the usual Evangelical banal phraseology to let them know... ...that I know their community's vernacular better than they do, and by the time I am finished, by the time I have translated the score back to them by tenfold relative to their passive-aggressive \"let us pray for you\", they murmur their thank yous and scuttle thou hell away. And now, hopefully, they will know how it feels to have someone inject an overwrought and venomous self-righteousness into the core of their being and--I hope--realize how much actions like these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBTQ people. Evangelicals: you are not doing the Lord's work by dumping your misplaced condescension on random strangers you believe to be, uh, \"broken\". These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I'm fairly sure Jesus would not do that. So, remember: if you ever feel the need to do this... don't. Because it may backfire spectacularly, and you'll wind up praying for a restored sense of peace after your varnish gets unceremoniously stripped away. Prayer should be a loving act, not a bizarre political weapon. POSTSCRIPT: Just wanna thank everyone who has reached out with kind and loving words as I can't respond individually. Folks of all backgrounds get why this is important, and it gives me heart to see so much growing support for the transgender community and LGBTQ folks as a whole.

I'm fucking pissed at @YouTube, which claims to support its LGBT creators, and has explicit policies against harassment and bullying: https://t.co/K9XJGAP7Xp https://t.co/4GUfTDuOXS This has been going on for years, and I've tried to flag this shit on several occasions. But YouTube is never going to actually enforce its policies. Because Crowder has 3 million YouTube subscribers, and enforcing their rules would get them accused on anti-conservative bias. Which is all to say: I work my fucking ass off to create smart, thorough, engaging content for @YouTube, a company that claims to give a shit about LGBT creators. And its miserable to have that same company helping facilitate a truly mind melting amount of direct harassment. My family sees this shit. I've had to explain to my much younger sister what the fuck a Steven Crowder is, and ask my siblings not to respond. Its exhausting. I wish @YouTube gave enough of a shit to stop its platform from becoming a fucking playground for assholes. This isn't about \"silencing conservatives.\" I don't give a flying fuck if conservatives on YouTube disagree with me. But by refusing to enforce its anti-harassment policy, YouTube is helping incredibly powerful cyberbullies organize and target people they disagree with. Anyway, if you want to help, I guess you can go to this dude's videos and flag them? But @YouTube isn't going to do anything, because YouTube does not give a fuck about queer creators. It cares about \"engagement,\" and homophobic/racist harassment is VERY \"engaging.\" Again, the problem isn't Crowder. There will always be fucking assholes trying to get attention by being bigots. The problem is that @YouTube is designed to give those assholes a megaphone, push new followers in their directions, and keep them listening. It's a weapon. YouTube does not give a fuck about queer creators. YouTube does not give a fuck about marginalized creators. YouTube does not give a fuck about diversity or inclusion. YouTube wants clicks. YouTube wants clicks. YouTube wants clicks. Harassment isn't siloed, either. Every time he makes one of these videos, his fans flood the comments on the original Vox video. So a piece I spent 4 weeks working on is drowning in homophobic and abusive comments and downvotes. Other Vox fans see it. It's humiliating. I cannot explain how awful it is to see a video where you're called a \"lispy queer\" pass a MILLION views. THOUSANDS of comments piling on. How the fuck are LGBT people expected to produce interesting content in this environment? Anyway can't fucking WAIT to see @YouTube's Pride month video where they pretend to give a shit about the well-being of LGBT creators in order to *checks notes* help draw more advertisers to the platform to make more money. A lot of people have pointed out that Crowder is wearing a “Socialism Is For Fags” shirt in several of his videos. Turns out, he sells that shirt to his YouTube fans, and proudly displays it in his Twitter cover photo. What are these platforms doing? https://t.co/x9F6xOFNhk If Crowder loses his channel, I’m going to get hit with another avalanche of abuse and will likely get doxxed again. That’s what’s so fucked up about these platforms: they create wildly powerful monsters and then ask the targets of abuse to draw further attention to themselves. Love to sit at home editing together clips of my abuse in order to publicly beg a platform to pay attention. Love to be an adult gay person and still have my identity marked by public humiliation.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"323599188"},"id_str":"323599188","name":"Carlos Maza","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"131948"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"259"},"created_at":"Sat Jun 25 03:08:29 +0000 2011","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"22103"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"19"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"61350"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"528652"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3229"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"27824"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.4994"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

Actually, the article itself isn't that weird, but the story behind the story is bonkers. This is a thread. Here we go. 1/ I began this reporting four years ago at another newspaper 1,900 miles away. In 2015, I was working at @MyDesert in Palm Springs, California. It was a few days before I took a vacation. A private eye I knew – Bill – called me. He said he found something big. It felt clandestine. I liked Bill, but I didn’t exactly trust him. He was a long-winded 70-something curmudgeon with a gravely voice who always told stories about his own greatness. (We have that in common.). With Bill, it was hard to tell truth from a boast. But I was so intrigued. I drive to Bill’s house. His home office is a wild mess – weird electronics and case files and shotgun shells are scattered across his desk. I can’t remember if he had a claymore or if that was Ron Swanson. Maybe both. Bill hands me a tube of prescription skin cream. (It looks like the blue creams in this photo.) I notice the name on the tube is not Bill. This is someone else's medicine. Bill says the cream is worth thousands of dollars. I roll my eyes. https://t.co/H6cqdcs02X Bill tells me a story. He says he stumbled upon a conspiracy where doctors in Tennessee are prescribing bullshit pain/scar cream to Marines in California. He thinks the goal is to defraud the government. Bill says he is working with the feds to catch these people. I don’t buy it. I think Bill either discovered nothing or inflated his role in a small investigation. But I interview him just in case. Proof, he says, will come from a whistleblower lawsuit, but suit will be sealed for a while. I have to believe him, he says. I don't. Then Bill says something that sticks with me. The Tennessee doctor is named Susy. He says this twice: “Who has ever heard of a doctor named Susy?” I’m insulted. My mother, a bad ass who could do anything, is named Susan. I thank Bill and leave. I go on vacation to attend the wedding of one of my best friends. We are drunk and merry. I forget all about the pain cream. I go back to work and focus on other stories. It is now 2018. After years of covering cops in the California desert, I got a new job as the health care reporter at The Tennessean in Nashville. I'm out of my element and I'm scared. I decide to work twice as hard so no one will notice. I start reading all our old health stories, studying my new home and my new beat. One night, I come across a short, forgettable story about two doctors at an East Tennessee clinic who confessed to defrauding the military with pain cream. https://t.co/Wdj8chyjHg One of the doctors is Susan Vergot. She goes by Susy. \"Who's ever heard of a doctor named Susy?\" I read everything I can find about her case. It turns out Susan Vergot and another doctor, Carl Lindblad, prescribed needless pain cream to California Marines to defraud a military insurance program called Tricare. The creams cost $14,000, each. The whole scam cost the America taxpayer about $65 million. It was just like Bill said, only bigger than he knew. By now, Bill’s whistleblower lawsuit is unsealed. It shows he communicated with the feds about the creams I saw in his home office back in 2015. A federal investigation into the conspiracy began 3 weeks after he handed over the creams to NCIS. Bill was right. It was true. As of today, four people have pleaded guilty in this cream case – two doctors, a nurse practitioner and an ex-Marine. Three more suspects have been charged. More indictments are likely. The feds are also trying to seize property in East Tennessee, including this mansion estate. https://t.co/4JaKmMiQqH Other journalists have published good articles on this case over the past few years, but nobody has the details in the story we published this morning. I’d be honored if you read it. https://t.co/hDqk5pTtge Also, there is a lesson here for young journalists: Don’t dismiss the weirdos and SAVE YOUR NOTES. I was only able to write this story because I went to Bill's house in 2015 and still had my notes from our interview years ago. @Poynter Thanks for going on this journey with me. As always, buy a damn newspaper subscription already. https://t.co/ogRc82YsAq","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1209304614"},"id_str":"1209304614","name":"Brett Kelman","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"8176"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2600"},"created_at":"Fri Feb 22 17:29:57 +0000 2013","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"12512"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"19"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"7165"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"37458"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"377"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1971"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.88618"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

I want to provide a little background. (Thread.) https://t.co/eYdUQMiYNE 2) Pittsford is one of the highly ranked districts in New York State. Like many suburban districts, it's mostly white: 78% white students, and 99.4% white teachers, according to the latest numbers we have. There are 481 teachers in the district. 478 are white. One is black. 3) If Pittsford's teaching staff was proportional to its student body, the district would need to immediately hire another 14 black teachers. (By the way, this issue is not unique to Pittsford, at all.) 4) The question is, does a lack of representation impact teaching and learning? Let's take a look at the botched Black History Month project. It happened at a Pittsford elementary school. The fifth grade assignment: honor 100 black inventors. Students created posters. 5) The students created the posters. The teachers hung them in the hallways for the month of February. On March 1st, Dr. Jerome Jean-Gilles was there, picking up his two young children. They are an African American family. 6) Jerome noticed the posters seemed off. Wrong names, information. But then he saw a string of posters that included the name of a black inventor, but a photo of a white man. He wondered: what on Earth is this about? White people getting credit for black inventions? 7) He took pictures of the posters; our story has three of them. We tried to figure out what happened. Let's look at these three. 8) One poster is for Powell Johnson, inventor of protective eyewear. The photo is of President Andrew Johnson, a man who routinely described African Americans as inferior. A google search produces no help in determining how a racist president was depicted on this poster. 9) Then you have a poster for Alexander P. Ashbourne, refiner of coconut oil. The white man depicted is apparently Arthur James Balfour, former prime minister of England. No idea how that mistake was made. 10) Then you have William Purvis, an African American who patented an improved hand stamp during the 1800s. The white man on the poster is Edward William Purvis, a British army officer. A google image search lists the Briton third. 11) So how did these posters, designed to honor Black History, and which instead depicted white men, end up hanging in the school hallway? Superintendent Mike Pero says the project was ungraded. Students handed them in; teachers hung them up. No checking for accuracy. 12) But how could these obviously wrong posters hang in the hallway for several weeks without correction? The staff is almost all white; no one noticed. It required a black parent to see the errors. Parents tell me: this is what happens when you have an all-white staff. But: 13) Superintendent Mike Pero flatly denies that. I asked if the incident could have been avoided with more diversity on staff. \"No. I don’t think diversity in the teaching staff had anything to do with this incident,\" he said. 14) Dr. Jean-Gilles was reluctant to talk to me. He does not seek attention. He wanted a meeting, and a guarantee that the mistakes would be corrected. He was told the project would not be redone; too much time had passed, and the district was concerned it could be politicized. 15) Pero: \"What we don’t want is for our staff to ever feel defensive or they’re on their heels or they’re going to be publicly shamed for doing something that has good intentions.\" He added that the district owns this failure, and will make sure it is not repeated. 16) Jerome's response: If this'd been a botched math lesson, of course it would be corrected. Why is a botched Black History project ignored? \"They didn’t even address this to the students. What’s the point of the school? If you’re not educating the students, what’s the point?” 17) Some parents have called for a Pittsford community forum. Superintendent Pero told me that this is not the right time for that kind of meeting, but the district is working with a new inclusivity committee. That work is meant to make all students and families feel welcome. 18) Dr. Jean-Gilles, meanwhile, is left wondering what to do next. He says he's entirely unsatisfied. He believes more diversity on the teaching staff would have made a difference. While Pero disagrees, he says he cares about representation on staff. 19/end) You can decide for yourself if you think an almost entirely all-white staff contributed to this breakdown. Meanwhile, WXXI will compile updated numbers on local districts. In three years, has anything changed? Care to guess?","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"16347115"},"id_str":"16347115","name":"Evan Dawson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"37093"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"4380"},"created_at":"Thu Sep 18 14:16:42 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"41957"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"19"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"54"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"234"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"12"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.98443"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

The dad has been detained at the Karnes detention center for 21 days with his 1 year old son. He came here from Honduras after a gang threatened to kill him. Here's what he shared with us today: \"My one-year-old son has had diarrhea every day since we arrived to Karnes. It has been over 21 days of non-stop diarrhea. It is a serious cause for concern when a one-year old baby has had diarrhea for so long.\" \"I am afraid of what can happen to my son if he becomes dehydrated or if serious complications develop as a result of the diarrhea while we are in detention.\" \"My son cannot eat the food served at Karnes. He neither receives a special, age-appropriate diet nor a diet specific for his health condition. All residents are served the same meals and no accommodations are made for serious medical and dietary needs\" \"The medical staff told me that I need to “force feed” my son if he won’t eat.\" (Any doctors out there? Is this advice good advice? It sounds like terrible advice to us.) \"I’ve been trying for weeks to get his medical records.\" Staff at the Karnes detention center have refused to share them. \"The medical staff has on more than one occasion told me that I need to force feed my one-year old son if he doesn’t want to drink milk or eat. When I do this, he vomits and gets sick—I’ve told them this repeatedly.\" \"Diarrhea in children can become dangerous quickly and as his father, I feel helpless knowing that his condition could become more complicated at any moment. How much longer can a one-year-old baby not eat and suffer from painful, dehydrating diarrhea before something is done?\" \"I have lost weight since being detained at Karnes. My pants are constantly sagging because of my weight loss. I cannot fathom the effects on my son’s body.\" \"In addition to the diarrhea, my son has developed a cough and runny nose that won’t go away.\" \"My son cannot sleep in detention at Karnes. He cries all night and is constantly woken up by all of the noise. He is having difficulty breathing and seems to have stomach pain, but I don’t know exactly the source of his pain because he can’t talk.\" \"At night, the guards check on us every few hours and are we shaken by the sounds of the guards opening and closing doors at all hours of the night.\" \"Prolonged detention with a one-year-old baby is an overwhelming, suffocating feeling. I do not feel like I can father my child here. I do not feel that I have control of his care.\" \"Babies do not speak, but they see &amp; feel what happens. I know my son feels the pressure of our prolonged detention &amp; cries because of it. He may be little, but he does not want to be here. I feel depressed knowing the effect that our prolonged detention is having on my son.\" This father and his son are getting ready to spend night 22 at the Karnes detention center. We're desperately need your help to tag @ICEgov and demand they release this family. Please do it now, and again in the morning if they are not released. We'll share any updates. @ICEgov The baby boy and his dad are still detained. Tonight will be night 23. Please continue to call on @icegov to release them immediately. The baby should not be kept in prison-like conditions without adequate medical attention. @ICEgov The baby &amp; his dad are getting released! We just got word. Can’t believe it. This happened because of your pressure. Thank you. But remember: lots more families are still locked up. They need to be released as well. We're working to help the dad get medical care upon release. @ICEgov The family is free! We met them at the airport this afternoon. Exhausted, excited, scared, worried - but free. We're chatting to the dad about medical support and figuring out next steps. Thank you all so much for your support.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184134"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"278"},"texto":"So, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has had a go at Sir John Major for being part of the European elite because of #Brexit. I think it is probably the time to tell a little story about JRM, how he acts and what people think of him. Are you sitting comfortably...? Back in the day, I started out as a research assistant at Scottish @Conservatives Central Office. As you’d imagine, I’ve a lot of stories I could tell but, sadly for you, you’ll never hear them. However, JRM has provoked this with his comments about Sir John. Back in 1997, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was the Tory candidate for Central Fife. His passage into the seat was helped by the powers that be so that he could follow the time-honoured path of so many with the right connections of fighting some unwinnable seats before being given a safe one. For those of you who don’t know, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is the son of Lord Rees-Mogg, the former Times editor. Central Fife was a no-hoper seat and it was an ideal place to show that JRM wasn’t scared of taking the Tory message to the most difficult of places. I'm pleased to say that, these days, @ScotTories doesn't have the same mentality now and actually has candidates that understand the areas they want to represent. It's quite refreshing. Now, if you are on the other side of the equation, you see a toff turn up with his nanny (yep, that did happen) to canvass and it reinforces everything you think about Tories. The powers that be seemed to miss that obvious consequence of placing @Jacob_Rees_Mogg in Central Fife. Still, at SCUCO (Scottish Central Office) it was our job to brief the candidates. As a lowly research assistant, I didn’t brief many as it was thought that they would probably want to be briefed by the head honcho (@iainastewart - now MP for Milton Keynes). On the face of it, having a visit from a candidate who was the multi-millionaire son of Lord Rees-Mogg should have been quite a thing. We were used to VIP visits and we knew who got treated how and why. But somehow… Mysteriously, the day Jacob Rees-Mogg visited, everyone (including Iain) was busy. I mean really busy. Weirdly, everyone was there but everyone was so, so busy that nobody could brief him and the welcome was beyond short. And so, Jacob Rees-Mogg was ushered in to my office. He sat opposite me, looked down his nose and listened as I started the briefing. It soon became clear that the briefing was of no interest to him at all. There was nothing I could tell him that he did not think he already knew (he didn't, of course, but he thought he did) In my time at SCUCO, I met and worked with people from the PM, cabinet ministers, MPs, councillors, Lords and Ladies and, I can say without fear of contradiction that the sneering sense of superiority during that half an hour was something I had never come across before or since. He was, he told me, in Scotland for a few hours to knock on some doors with Nanny and then he would be going back home. Such was his commitment – and also his contempt for the people of Central Fife. He left and I never heard from him again – indeed, I think @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was just about the only candidate in that election that never bothered asking a research question or policy clarification. As an aside, only one other person has ever refused a briefing from me and that, by some incredible coincidence, was @BorisJohnson – and it was made clear to me that if I wrote one, he would not read it. I suppose these #Brexit-ers aren't keen on facts. By contrast, I was sat in my office one day, typing, concentrating on the screen when I was suddenly aware of someone walking into my room. I looked up as he held out his hand and said “Hello, I’m John Major!” No pretence. No ‘do you not know who I am’. No ‘I’m better than you’. It was just a greeting that assumed nothing but was genuinely meant. We talked for a couple of minutes (I mentioned that we’d met before and we talked briefly about that before he remembered it) and then he was gone. His last words were “Thank you for everything you are doing.” Of course, Sir John did not need to thank me. I was doing it because of him and what he stood for. I would have done it if he hadn't paid me. And, anyway, why thank me? It was my job. But he did. And that says something about him. At the end of the day, @jacob_rees_mogg will never amount to anything or achieve anything without the help of others. He is the very epitome of the British elite establishment that cares about nothing other than feathering their own nests - something #Brexit facilitates. .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg can say what he wants about Sir John Major but, the bottom line is this: John Major is a member of no elite. He came from nothing, worked his way up &amp; he has more natural class, sense &amp; style than JRM or his ilk could ever hope for. And that will always be true.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"9820002"},"id_str":"9820002","name":"James Barisic 🇪🇺 🇫🇷 🇭🇷 #FBPE","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"7375"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"5601"},"created_at":"Wed Oct 31 10:30:31 +0000 2007","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"90593"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"19"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"11228"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"26098"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"591"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1374"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.81456"},"all_hashtags":["Brexit"],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

Here are six things I wish I'd known: 1) At a startup, you will probably make less money at first. Yes, if you join the perfect startup early enough, your equity may someday turn into a private island and 200 foot yacht. But, in the meantime, your take home pay is likely going to be a bit less than it is now. The so-called “golden handcuffs” that big companies give you in stock grants/bonuses that vest over time are because those companies need to overpay you in order to get you to stay. Think about the metaphor for a second: You don't have to handcuff people to things they love. You can make a great living at a startup of course, and growth stage startups in particular pay competitively and often with fantastic benefits. But if optimizing for the most take home cash is your #1 priority, keep your job. Seriously… it’s ok. Startups are not for everyone. 2) About your resume: if you’ve been at a big company for a long time, you really need to figure out what experiences you’ve had that show depth outside of that company. Wrote apps for an unfamiliar platform? Started a nonprofit? Ran a successful Kickstarter campaign? All great. When I left Microsoft after 16 years, I had worked on what seemed to me to be a dizzying array of roles and products. Within Microsoft, that was compelling. To the external world, it was just 16 monolithic years at MSFT and everyone asked pointedly: why didn’t you leave sooner? Also, leave off whatever “high potential” programs you were selected to, or awards you won inside of the megacorp. Same with review scores. Those don’t matter on the outside, and just show that you're still deeply entrenched in the value system of the company you're leaving. 3) Here’s something it took me a long time to learn on the outside: say “I” instead of “we.” Working for @stevesi at MSFT, I learned an incredibly important lesson about leading inside of a large team: always say “we did this” not “I did this.” Perfect advice for that situation. When interviewing, though, saying “we did this\" makes it hard to identify your personal contribution. I find myself talking to megacorp candidates trying to understand what did *they* do? What specific designs did they draw… what code did they write… what ideas were theirs? But also, don’t claim personal accomplishment for a team effort unless you provably did it. You probably didn’t “bring AI to iOS” yourself. You didn’t “create the Windows 7 kernel” or “increase S3’s scalability 400%” yourself. Specify *your* actual contribution to the product. 4) For devs: show true curiosity outside of your company’s stack. Your mastery of Google’s internal experimentation pipeline is not interesting outside of Google. If you are MSFT and I ask you if you’ve used Redis and you say “you mean Azure Redis Cache?”, that’s not a good sign. This means if you work for Amazon, build something on DigitalOcean. Googler? Build with React. From Microsoft? Get into AWS. The best big company devs we’ve hired are the ones with natural, proven technical curiosity outside of their company’s native stack, shown by actual work. Don’t say the reason you want to join a startup is “to have a chance to learn XYZ technology.” Learn and build with the tech you are curious about yourself… your company is not in control of your learning. Prove that you’re curious by actions, not words. 5) Be a worker… and be prepared to show it. Big companies are necessarily full of people whose primary job it is to carry information from one meeting to another, from one department to another. Middle managers and PMs, in particular, are often defined by this type of work. Startups don’t have this kind of “info pusher” job. They can’t afford to, and they’re not big enough to need it. Everyone is responsible for making something, building product, owning decisions, selling something, hustling. You can’t just show up at the meeting and “seem senior.” Big company folks sometimes flame out at startups because this kind of individual work is not what they actually want. No judgment from me or anyone else if it’s not… be honest with yourself about the degree to which you want to be on the frontlines, making or selling things. 6) Embrace the unique skills you developed in a big company. No one builds more reliable software at scale than Amazon or Google… this knowledge can be a huge boon to a startup. Salesforce perfected solution-based selling; this may help scale your SaaS startup’s sales expertise. Don’t feel like you have to be on your back foot or defensive about your time at a megacorp. It took me a year out of Microsoft to realize that so much of what I learned there was applicable in my new startup job—i just needed to learn to apply it in a different environment. There’s a whole world out here, free from the walls of your megacorp job. Enter into it for the right reasons, and you'll find joining a startup to be truly transformative for your career and rejuvenating for your soul. Prepare for it the right way, and you too can join us! 🙌","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14533639"},"id_str":"14533639","name":"Jensen Harris","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"7117"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"178"},"created_at":"Fri Apr 25 20:27:08 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"678"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"19"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2470"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"12310"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"130"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"648"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.1843"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

But perhaps the weirdest part has been the various very strange British media interviews with Irish politicians. [Thread] 2. The restrained irritation, anger even, has been quite something to see. It’s understandable that questions like, ‘Why don’t you compromise?’... 3. ...Or, the cosmically crass, ‘Why don’t you leave the EU?’ Are greeted with a profound sense of humour failure. 4. Of all the many reasons Irish politicians might be cross, one in particular seems to have escaped the attention of many commentators. 5. THE IRISH BACKSTOP IS NOT NEWS. 6. Let us count the ways. 7. The backstop was first hatched in the Joint Declaration of December 2017. Its implications were crystal clear to most sentient beings. 8. The backstop was reaffirmed by the PM in early 2018. By this point its implications should have been crystal clear to literally everyone. 9. Did anyone try to stop this terrible thing happening? Was there a no confidence vote in the PM given the terribleness of the backstop. There was not. 10. In fact, we had to wait for the Chequers debacle before there were any material Cabinet resignations. 11. Even more strangely, given the now apparent awfulness of the backstop, the government did not try to scrap it. 12. Instead, the government’s principal diplomatic achievement of the entire negotiations was to transform it into an all UK arrangement. 13. Even then, as Conservative opposition mounted, was there a no confidence vote in the PM because of the awfulness of the backstop? There was not. 14. We had to wait until December for the no confidence vote and even then was the matter of the backstop so terrible that TM lost the vote? 🤔 15. It was only after the Meaningful Vote debacle that the Irish backstop issue appeared as the apparently defining Deal or No Deal issue. 16. And even then, it was only because a 100 or so Conservative MPs decided, many of them belatedly to one degree or another, they didn’t like it. 17. To call the previous absence of effective (or meaningful) opposition to the backstop gross incompetence is unfair to gross incompetents everywhere. 18. After almost two years of hard fought negotiations, an issue that has been obvious for at least a year and was agreed by the UK government is now going to cause No Deal? Please. 19. No wonder Irish politicians seem furious. And no wonder there is close to zero chance of materially amending the backstop that was agreed months and months ago. /ends","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"782667979741814784"},"id_str":"782667979741814784","name":"The Columnist","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"17406"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2196"},"created_at":"Sun Oct 02 19:46:02 +0000 2016","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"20719"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"19"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1177"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"4990"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"62"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"263"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.97671"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

I'm often asked how India compares to SV hot-bed of enterprise innovation. Besides US, I feel world-class enterprise startups will come from India &amp; here's why 👇: 1/n First, some market truths - more and more unicorns are now found outside of the US. Primary reason: internet penetration. https://t.co/HQE0dzvza3 2/n Strong correlation exists between internet availability and affordability to large pools of value creation. The story that played out in US &amp; China b/w 2000-2018 is starting to play out in India now. But aren’t these mostly B2C companies like Google/FB? https://t.co/K3y080fKka 3/n Internet penetration has benefited B2C but has 2nd order impact on B2B. For every Dropbox or Facetime, there’s also a Box or Zoom using digital tools to build, test, &amp; launch at breakneck speeds &amp; then in “consumerish ways” brands, sell, &amp; monetize enterprises. 4/n “Developer is the new buyer” -- think fewer site-wide MSDN or RHEL licenses, more personal/team-wide Github/Slack/digitalOcean accounts. Corporate IT spend will disaggregate and many top-down decisions will turn bottoms-up where individual “consumer” needs to be influenced. 5/n Founders w/ dev-first mindset will win big globally &amp; Indian founders have a unique advantage here: our developer ecosystem is one of the most vibrant in the world. We are curious, engaged, &amp; hungry to learn. Being a techie in India isn’t “geeky/nerdy”, it’s cool, fashionable https://t.co/dxQzL93Jvh 6/n But wait a minute? Isn’t India the call center / BPO capital of the world? You would be right.. 15-20 years ago. Simpson has a hilarious take on it. https://t.co/OdwAPJ0W5h 7/n If you’ve been following the India story since the late 90s, the top students from IITs were going into BPO/KPO roles at firms like Infosys/EvalueServe, etc. By late 2000s, India had started to shift squarely to product w/ companies like InMobi / Exotel paving the way https://t.co/64fJ90GSTf 8/n And now India is very SaaS focused, built and delivered on the cloud, and not just that, our enterprise solutions have... https://t.co/5hprhznDoo 9/n ...gone global from humble beginnings in Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, etc. E.g. - postman just raised a massive 300M round w/ huge developer adoption. Browserstack has seen fantastic growth, &amp; Freshworks hit 100M ARR last year (public sources): https://t.co/rKeL0NGMel 10/n By itself, India is now the 2nd largest public cloud buyer in APAC, ~50% of China &amp; growing faster. Vs China, the Indian buyer is hungrier &amp; doesn’t care for brand or roadmap (so, ideal for startups), is more top-line focused &amp; trying to get more process-driven to scale. https://t.co/7wkz2JahCk 11/n With a lot of headroom yet to grow - almost 90B of IT spend overall, much of it in devices and services that are bound to get eaten by software in coming years… https://t.co/oEFLvGvisc 12/n ...which is where, as you would expect, most of the growth is coming from (note: this is just the public cloud consumption data; pvt clouds may be multiples): https://t.co/gKqQttOVLC 13/n While India-to-US has been tried before successfully, India now has the potential to be the Enterprise / SaaS hub for local and SEA markets. Why? https://t.co/B9dM8BDTt2 14/n China enterprise cos are either h/w focused or serve local markets. Meanwhile, rest of SEA has strong cultural, language AND use-case alignment w/ India given history &amp; development stage (gig-based, migrant population, etc). Works in India? Can work there. 15/n and to support all this value creation, the key pieces are coming together nicely. Vast majority of founders now have prior startup experience -- this is where many of the smartest people are headed -- not banking, consulting, or Google/FB. https://t.co/ppAGVnVMED 16/n and governmental reforms across taxation, ease of doing business, payments, and updated bankruptcy codes are providing additional tailwinds and making it easier for founders to take more risks and fail gracefully: https://t.co/tMY9Y4xpNY 17/n Results? Large companies picking India as their 1st international market, while indian cos going global both in consumer &amp; enterprise - e.g. @lightspeedIndia portcos @innovaccer (US) &amp; @oyorooms (China, US, etc), &amp; @theDarwinbox &amp; @YellowMssngrAI getting inbounds frm SEA https://t.co/h2FjmD8nId 18/n Indian enterprise founders have tasted blood. They are hungry, experimental, and live/breathe tech. The next 10 years in India are going to be really exciting for enterprise founders!

In a panicked move, he named Dr Ronny Jackson as his Medical Advisor 6 days beforehand. Ronny gave him the fantasy physical last yr &amp; is under investigation. This feels very much like Trump is cornered 2 A real physical for someone in Trump’s condition would immediately trigger a referral to a neurological team to further evaluate his symptoms &amp; deterioration. Most likely, White House Doctor Sean Conley isn’t giving Trump a pass on his condition or glowing review like Ronny did 3 It is possible Trump wants Ronny to do another sham exam. There is also the possibility that Trump is in a jam &amp; wants Ronny there to control the results other doctors get. By looking to Ronny, it may be a sign Trump's doctors are not going to play along with the health charade 4 Dementia patients have an initial time period where they can work &amp; live a normal life. Trump’s enablers extended his time in an executive role far beyond any rational measure. Grifters gotta grift &amp; this family, so bereft of integrity, needs him as Pres to maximize their grift 5 Trump is in denial. He will never admit to Dementia. Even when he’s in a wheelchair &amp; can’t speak the Trumpsters will claim it’s something else. Dementia to Trump, would end his greatness. Ivanka &amp; the rest of them must know what’s happening, but if they act, they are at risk. 6 I suspect Dr Harold Bornstein saw it or gave him softened bad news like “they are just senior moments, stay active”. Doctors don’t like to destroy patients hopes. Knowing dementia moves slowly at first, they will tone down the alarm &amp; eventually give a referral to a neurologist 7 Normally the public would not be diagnosing Trump from afar. It’s usually a private matter- the patient lightens their load and withdraws from public life. What we have with Trump is a unique spectacle- a TV President in mid stage dementia with an active cover up taking place. 8 He’s not faking. His symptoms go way back. I saw it when he announced his run. They are obvious &amp; extreme now. Don’t worry he’s not getting off. He doesn’t have a legal guardian yet &amp; he committed all his crimes when he knew of a concept some people follow called right vs wrong 9 Dementia didn’t make Trump a narcissistic criminal &amp; traitor. He is a narcissistic criminal &amp; traitor who developed dementia. He will be held responsible &amp; won’t escape punishment. The evil in his soul is laid bare by dementia, while most sociopaths are better at concealing it 10 Trump’s dementia became much more obvious at the G7 in June 2018. This thread within a thread has a large amount of further detail. https://t.co/vGMjyE22kc 11 Trump's dementia, as expected, was even more pronounced in Paris this fall, where he mostly stayed in his room and made this wobbly walk from his limo. Balance issues will steadily worsen and lead to a wheelchair. https://t.co/3wEKi3dUqW 12 Trump has new recent symptoms of dementia. He’s not just slurring, he can’t form certain sounds at all and drops the entire syllable when speaking. Like this: https://t.co/gj2HFDGkXA 13 He is losing his memory now. He couldn’t remember Michael Cohen’s father-in-law’s name in one interview. Days later, in another interview he couldn’t remember what he said about the father-in-law. “I did have to read what I said. What did I say? I don’t know. What did I say?” 14 Trump is dominated by dementia now. We are also dominated by it. The majority of the news is really about Trump’s aberrant behavior. Stop and think about that. Here’s a fresh list of Trump’s obvious dementia symptoms: https://t.co/soqjMPkt2S 15 What is it? Frontotemporal Dementia has a few sub forms. I suspect his is PSP- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. It takes a neurological exam, workup, baseline, MRI &amp; time comparison to nail it down. Without getting in to Tau protein info, basically brain cells steadily die off. 16 The public will eventually learn the diagnosis. Once Trump is yanked from office, his lawyers may try to leverage it with home detention before trial, instead of the specially built prison/nursing home setup that he will live his remaining days in. He remains a security risk. 17 Trump is being propped up by: -A WH that has become a luxury assisted living center. -Enablers who want to extend their own positions &amp; priorities -Probably a drug cocktail like Memantine, Levodopa, Zoloft for memory movement &amp; mood. -The Adderall rumors are probably true too. 18 A message for the Media: You are missing a big one. The reporter that exposes the coverup of Trump's health issues will have a bombshell story. The drugs, the enablers, the near disasters. Even Ronny doing a venogram &amp; neck ultrasound after a slurring incident was glossed over 19 END Eventually Trump will become incapacitated. Clinically said, the prognosis is poor. There are zero dementia survivors on the planet. It steadily worsens w/ no remission. Drugs don't work. The outcome is set no matter what Ronny or anyone else does.

For starters, Metro is a widely considered by the general public NOT to be a reputable source (browse this reddit thread: https://t.co/UgENWy37zx). So who is this \"Jonathan Hicap”? Apparently someone who does NOT have connections with YouTube, if his tweets are anything to go by. This is him back when ‘FAKE LOVE’ was released: https://t.co/O2kBktj3gd This is incredibly sketchy—someone who has a direct line of contact with YouTube would not need to @ them on Twitter. In addition, his public email is a Gmail, which I can assure you from personal experience does not hold as much weight as one from an established institution. YouTube very rarely gives official statements, and especially never to a reporter from an outlet like Metro. So that’s already strike one. Yet, less than 24 hours later, he publishes an article “confirming” FL views by a “YouTube spoksperson.” Note that the first mention is plural, “reps for YouTube” and the second is singular, “THE spokesperson.” He also inconsistently put a space between a number and ‘million.’ https://t.co/L5052FA4OM These inconsistencies might seem minor, but they can actually function as cues to detect when someone is lying. Just compare that quote an actual one from a YT spokesperson; there is a glaringly stark difference between the sophistication of the language employed. https://t.co/8enoNhyoCk Literally all the articles confirming FL’s 24-hour views from that point on either cites the Metro article or casually throws out “officially” with no source. https://t.co/LHZk4LqrfV The only time I could find YT putting out an official confirmation for the first 24-hour views was for PSY’s ‘Gentleman’ back in 2013 when he shattered the previous record. The “next” time was in 2017 when Taylor‘s LWYMMD broke his record, but even that confirmation was sketchy. https://t.co/PT2XDgnHnA YT has NEVER released an official statement about the “biggest 24 hour debut of 20XX” or the “third largest debut of all time.” Jonah’s “confirmation” is inconsistent with any prior behavior of YT and nothing suggests that they would take the initiative to release such statements Quick interlude: I emailed him asking for evidence of his correspondence with YT and he has yet to respond. https://t.co/bRLtN6CGDR Continuing on, he also wrote the first article for B*’s 24-hour views almost three weeks after the MVs’ release, again with the same “YouTube spokesperson.” And he really exposes himself this time because he wrote two articles with different wording of the same quote “from YT.” https://t.co/dkV4oXLwbI He literally uses the same EXACT wording (“making it the biggest 24 hour debut of 2018”) as he did in the BTS article: https://t.co/2LTbr1bil8 He also added a bit at the end for shits and giggles about fun kpop stats. YouTube has never ever released such an obscure statement like this. LITERALLY. NEVER. EVER. EVER. https://t.co/tJaYNlNPMn Once again, all the subsequent articles about the record are based off of this article because the “YouTube spokesperson” apparently didn’t respond to anyone else’s inquiries. https://t.co/UpangGtESq On IG, Y* used screenshots from his sketchy article and the subsequent Billboard article quoting his article about the views. These are not legitimate. I could write an article right now about a YT spokesperson saying IDOL reached 5 billion views and it would be just as true. https://t.co/ZNLMktTF7g For a bonus, he also reported on Tw*ce’s first 24-hour views in which a YouTube rep uses the singular “I” to confirm the view count. No spokesperson of a huge multinational company would use “I” in an official statement. This guy just can’t quit. https://t.co/3ez3Zbt5B4 Compare once again the language used there and the language used in an actual statement: https://t.co/cefF0hTRdg I’m going to be real—I can’t believe no one caught this. You could smell this from a mile away. If this isn’t proof that ARMYs—and everyone, for that matter—need to practice caution when reading an article, I really don’t know what else is. We’ve all been lied to. In conclusion, what we can take away is that we still don’t know our FL first 24-hour views and Jonah Hicap’s “YouTube spokesperson” is as real as Bugs Bunny. Whether or not there are ulterior motives at play, I’ll let you decide.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"979171706639134720"},"id_str":"979171706639134720","name":"The Onion","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"14719"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"109"},"created_at":"Thu Mar 29 01:41:41 +0000 2018","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"8289"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"20"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"8577"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"23106"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"429"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1155"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.37039"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

Secondarily, the mean time of abortion was 22 weeks, which is in the second trimester, not the third. https://t.co/rGE0CI6b79 4/ Here is a link to the 2013 study: https://t.co/xToyeaMG9C https://t.co/c74dqkKjAy 5/ Then, today, @xan_desanctis, of @TheAtlantic, repeated Douthat’s false claim, linking to the same 2013 research paper. Notably, she lifts a quote from the paper's lit review that is *not* a description of the paper's findings. https://t.co/j45OuiVPDL https://t.co/cJPkqip5Li 6/ After I pointed out that the 2013 paper couldn't draw these conclusions bc abortions due 2 maternal health/fetal anomaly were EXCLUDED from the sample, the dregs of twitter put on their genius caps &amp; said, “Well the study says in the lit review that other research found that!” https://t.co/zG00RclI0c 7/ So, a few things: you should not copy and paste claims from a study’s lit review &amp; cite them as the source for those research findings b/c 1st: that’s not how citations work. 2nd: Lit reviews often contain errors &amp; misrepresentations of other research. 3rd: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄. 8/ But given this misrepresentation is especially pernicious, I decided to do a public service &amp; fact-check the citations. Plz note I was only able to do this b/c I have a subscription to academic data bases. The research is not available w/out one So, what did I find? . . . . 9/ The 2013 lit review’s representation of the previous research WAS flawed. Specifically, the claim that “data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment” is not supported by citations #5 OR #21. https://t.co/Ql150nmKJY 10/ Citation #5: This study examined abortion incidence, as well as ability to access abortions by region. The researchers also looked at prevalence of harassment at clinics. https://t.co/VBFCzXEIAw 11/ The researchers did NOT collect data on gestational age! Nor did they report data on *reasons* for seeking an abortion, such as fetal anomaly. This means that one cannot draw ANY conclusions about EITHER of these factors from this paper. https://t.co/6N104euRLZ 12/ So, again: don’t copy &amp; paste from lit reviews. 13/ Okay, on to the next cited study (ref #21): “Attitudes and Decision Making Among Women Seeking Abortions at One U.S. Clinic.” Do the results from THIS study support the claims about reasons for seeking \"later term\" abortions? Short answer: NO. https://t.co/hUi32Vc9FG 14/ This study looked at whether or not women had high/low confidence in their decision to have an abortion. This was the dependent variable. The independent variables included demographics (age/race, etc), as well as spiritual beliefs, having a supportive partner, etc. https://t.co/v42gCi2zWi 15/ The presence of fetal anomaly WAS included as a variable. However, again, this study was not investigating REASONS for obtaining an abortion. It was looking at the effect of the above variables on *confidence* in the decision. 16/ Nor was the effect of fetal anomaly *ever* investigated by *time* of abortion. There is *no* possible way to examine whether fetal anomaly or maternal health was a reason for seeking a second or third trimester abortion from the data in this study. 17/ So, overall, let's be clear: Regardless of what these two studies found, both Douthat &amp; DeSanctis misrepresented the original 2013 research they were citing. This was the paper that excluded maternal health/fetal anomaly from the study. *This* is the primary issue. https://t.co/Y3fcb4lIaT 18/ Second, neither of the studies cited in the 2013 paper found what the authors claimed they had found. I don’t want to excuse this error, but I will say this is VERY COMMON in academic research. 19/ Which is why your professors try SO HARD to teach you when you are a freshman in college to check PRIMARY SOURCES. This means: don’t copy &amp; paste claims from lit reviews. 20/ @DouthatNYT should delete his tweets &amp; the @nytimes should issue a statement that one of their columnists was spreading misinformation on the internet @TheAtlantic should tell @xan_desanctis to correct her article It shouldn't be on *readers* to fact-check journalistic orgs","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2155641480"},"id_str":"2155641480","name":"Mangy Jay","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"16097"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"4960"},"created_at":"Fri Oct 25 21:19:23 +0000 2013","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"63859"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"20"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1869"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7480"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"93"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"374"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.8959"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

But his most famous result is important and amazing. Let me tell you about it. (note: this is all from before my time, so I'm telling the simplified story) Well before Hawking, we understand the existence of black holes as a gravitational body. They are a solution to Einstein's General Relativity field equations; the unique solution for a point mass. But there was a problem: black holes are the unique solution, so there appears to be only one state of \"a black hole\" for a given mass (and spin and charge). That means that a black hole should have zero entropy. And that's a problem, because that means that you could reduce the entropy of the Universe by throwing a system with non-zero entropy into a black hole. And there's one law we don't want to break, its the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics: entropy always increases. So, you can say \"ok, we don't know how the entropy comes about, but let's just declare that black holes have entropy. Problem solved.\" (and we still don't know \"where\" the entropy of black holes is coming from). Hawking was part of formalizing this. But that introduces a new problem A system with non-zero entropy has a temperature. And things with temperature MUST radiate. But how does that work? After all, the notable property of black holes is their blackness: nothing escapes. So how can they radiate? Hawking figured out how to resolve this conflict. What he figured out how to do was calculate the quantum field theory near the edge of a black hole (right outside the event horizon). Far from a black hole, spacetime is \"flat\" and you can calculate the configuration of quantum fields that we think of as \"the vacuum\" (empty space). You can do the same thing for \"empty space\" near the edge of a black hole. However, what Hawking did was show that the \"empty space/vacuum\" configuration near the event horizon was *different* from the one far from the black hole. Moreover if you started with fields in the vacuum configuration near the black hole, far from the black hole, they'd look exactly like a thermally radiating system. That is, by bending spacetime, the black hole made the vacuum itself radiate away energy. The source of this energy is the black hole's mass, and eventually this process (Hawking radiation) would cause the black hole to evaporate. And there is still so much we don't understand about what all this means. We still don't really know where the entropy of a black hole is coming from. But Hawking made the connection explicit: there is a black hole entropy, it's proportional to the surface area, and it's enormous Further, Hawking did a calculation that mixes general relativity and quantum field theory. We often talk about these two theories as incompatible (and thus: string theory), but in limited cases you can calculate with both. Hawking did it. (There's another way to describe Hawking radiation as \"virtual particles near the horizon, one falls in, the other escapes.\" That's not even really morally incorrect, but its slightly more accurate to think of the vacuum changing.) Anyway, Hawking radiation allows one to show that the maximum entropy ANY volume can have is the entropy of a black hole contained in the volume. Since the entropy of a black hole is set by the surface area, this means the maximum entropy of a volume goes like the area. That's sort of nuts, because it means if I make a room 2x larger in each dimension, I can fit 2^3=8 times as much stuff, but only 2^2=4 times as much entropy (\"information\" loosely speaking). So somehow, the information in volume is encoded in the surface area of the volume. This is the \"holographic principle\" and I don't think we have a great idea of what it means about how our Universe is put together. Anyway, Hawking radiation is a fascinating thing. And it is the opening step in a really interesting area of physics that seems to be saying something very deep about how the Universe works. I'm not sure what. Hawking was a great scientist. The world might not have known of him had he never suffered from his illness, but they should have. Just wanted to talk a bit about his work. Hawking radiation wasn't the only thing he's done. But it's maybe his most famous (and the easiest for me to try to explain)","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"39005137"},"id_str":"39005137","name":"Matthew Buckley","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"5995"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"450"},"created_at":"Sun May 10 05:46:44 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"30140"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"20"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3313"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"10338"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"166"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"517"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.03385"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

A concerted effort to overturn an entire presidency leaves its inevitable bread crumbs that can be traced to its respective originators. 2. Most of you understand the origins of the Trump-Russia dossier originated by Christopher Steel under aegis of Glenn Simpson via FusionGPS and funded by DNC. I quote this reference thread only because it has a lot of other threads ensconced within it. https://t.co/MYB6bDPgma 3. @SharylAttkisson wrote today about a \"sensitive matter team\" which included James Comey and his chief of staff James Rybicki. That sensitive matter was most likely the Trump-Russia story/narrative. 4. Recently obtained emails by Justice department IG referred to the existence of this \"sensitive matter team\" These emails were turned over to Senate Homeland Sec Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, who wrote to FBI Director Chris Wray asking for identity of all members of this team 5. On Jan 6, 2017, Comey's chief of staff Rybicki emailed unidentified recipients: “[Director Comey] is coming to HQ briefly now for an update on the sensitive matter team.” https://t.co/enftMwGFHs 6. Later that day Comey briefed President-elect Trump on some of the salacious, unverified allegations in the Steele dossier. The next day, Comey outlined this briefing in an email to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI General Counsel James Baker and Chief of Staff Rybicki 7. Here is where things get really, really interesting, Comey wrote to the other 3 members of his cadre: \"I said there was something [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper wanted me to speak to [President Elect Trump] about alone or in a very small group,” 8. Comey continued “I then executed the session exactly as I had planned…I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook.” So, Comey is laying out what he said to Trump, describing how things went. 9. Of course, currently DNI clapper works at CNN, like Asha Rangappa, Josh Campbell to name a few. (Both take decidedly anti-Trump stances at CNN) A day later, Jan. 8, McCabe emailed Comey and Rybicki with the subject title: “Flood is coming.” Read it again: \"Flood is coming: 10. “CNN is close to going forward with the sensitive story,” McCabe wrote. “The trigger for them is they know the material was discussed in the [presidential] brief and presented in an attachment.” 11. Within an hour of “Flood is coming” email, McCabe emailed then-Deputy General Sally Yates and her top aide, Principal Deputy AG Matthew Axelrod, with the title “News.” “Just an FYI, and as expected, it seems CNN is close to running a story about the sensitive reporting.” 12. On Jan. 10, CNN published a story headlined, “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.” The same day, BuzzFeed News published the contents of the “Steele dossier.” 13. Of course James Clapper famously said to Congress he never discussed the Steele Trump-Russia Dossier with journalists. Then, in an abrupt volte-face acknowledged discussing it with CNN journalist Jake Tapper https://t.co/xc3FjwDeae 14. To recapitulate: Comey, McCabe, Clapper et al were a part of a \"sensitive matter team\". They leaked this story to CNN, who then published it. At the same time, buzzfeed published the Dossier in its entirety. Clapper would later go on to be employed by CNN. 15. If the impact of this story is not readily felt by you, I suggest you sit down, read #14 yet again then go back to #1 and re-read the whole thread before continuing further. It is absolutely astounding that Comey/McCabe et al hacked away at the very foundation of democracy 16. Rewind a little to Dec of 2016, @tracybeanz recently broke a story where she discovered that the Christopher Steele Trump Russia Dossier was buttressed by a memo riddled with inaccuracies published in Dec 2016, that was picked up by Crowdstrike. https://t.co/3ndRy15WY6 17. John McCain seemed to be pivotal in this stage of dissemination and propagation of the false narrative. The December 2016 memo started by taking about Michael Cohen being in Prague (which NEVER really happened) and then continued to propound multitudinous falsehoods. 18. What you have here is a concerted effort with active and contemporaneous co-operation between politicians, elements in the intelligence community and news media to subvert democracy and overthrow an entire presidency. This simply because the president was not to their liking 19. As things start to unravel and reveal themselves in their true putrid glory, we will see the news media go into confabulatory overdrive. To obfuscate, confabulate and discombobulate is their only endgame in pursuit of survival. Stay vigilant. https://t.co/xoRdlQEGik 20.

The biggest companies in the world are now launching cryptocurrencies. BOOM. 2/ I know, I know, “it’s not a cryptocurrency!!!” some will yell. Well, yes and no. Relative to PayPal or to the US dollar, Libra is very much a cryptocurrency. Relative to Bitcoin or ZCash or DAI, Libra is not all that crypto-y. 3/ Libra deserves nuanced analysis, it is neither “great” nor “horrendous.” This brings up an important point too often missing in discussions of crypto: digital assets and blockchains have *many* attributes, optimizing for certain ones can detract from others, and that’s okay. 4/ Lots of blockchain projects will be created and played with while the world rebuilds the financial system upon this new technology. Different assets will serve different markets, at different times, in different ways. 5/ Libra will serve the mass market, and be the single largest bridge toward decentralized finance that has ever been built. Prior to this, the largest bridge was Coinbase, which has played an integral role in crypto’s rise. 6/ The Good: Libra is built on an actual blockchain (based on HotStuff BFT, similar but not identical to, and compatible with, Cosmos’ Tendermint protocol). Much/most of the important components are open-source and can be built on in a permissionless way. 7/ Next, Libra made the (great) decision to NOT back itself solely with USD. This has profound implications. Libra can arguably become a medium-term replacement to any single government fiat currency. Libra is, arguably, superior/above the US Government dollar. 8/ To whomever bravely navigated Facebook into creating a currency above the US dollar, kudos to you. That took balls and probably a lot of work. It was the right decision. I was worried FB Coin would just be a lame proxy for US dollar, and it is not. 9/ Next, Libra has the potential (and current plan) to go from “a little decentralized” on day one, to “moderately decentralized” within a few years of launch. The plan is clearly to gradually decentralize with time. Good plan, we’ll see if they can actually do it. 10/ Finally, and let’s not minimize this one, Libra has a good chance of helping hundreds of millions of people avoid middlemen fees and increase their wealth and financial sovereignty *relative to the status quo banking system* Humanitarians rejoice. 11/ Now the bad: Libra is clearly not a “pure cryptocurrency.” Nobody should expect privacy by using it. Nobody should expect the true borderless standard of most cryptos. Libra will never be available in Iran due to sanctions, for example. 12/ Next: the governing consortium can explicitly block/prevent txs. You won’t find unstoppable finance here. Again, in this, traditional cryptos are far superior. But let’s be realistic, there’s no way FB could create an unstoppable coin (at least, not in its 1st phase…) 13/ Next: Libra achieves stability (a critical feature for most normies) by backing the coin with a basket of a) government fiat, and b) government debt (bonds). Personally, I want nothing to do with either of these “assets.” 14/ Over the long term, any currency based on fiat will fail relative to hard assets (Bitcoin, gold, etc.) Politicians debase currency as their modus operandi, and thus if Libra maintains fiat backing it tend toward zero long term. BTC and “real” cryptos will crush it long term. 15/ Over the short/medium term, this relative stability derived by fiat/bond backing will enable Libra to capture marketshare and onboard literally hundreds of millions of people. They will be moving partially away from banks, and partially toward true decentralized finance. 16/ Libra, because it is *kinda* a cryptocurrency will *kinda* run up against many of the legal/regulatory challenges that real cryptos and crypto companies do. FB has the resources (and hopefully the balls) to fight some of the battles. 17/ Libra may also become the whipping boy of cryptocurrency. As the politicians of the world get irate at having their fiat supremacy challenged, they will call on FB to answer for it. These struggles, playing out over the coming years, will be fascinating. 18/ Libra has a chance, if they are brave and tactical over many years, to ultimately move away from a fiat basket toward either a real basket (BTC, gold, etc), or possibly just becoming a hard asset on its own (requiring knowable supply with zero or low debasement). 19/ Ultimately, Libra’s relationship with those of us in crypto will be mixed. It will be a love/hate relationship, and that’s okay. Libra is challenging the status quo of fiat more than it challenges true crypto, and will pull millions toward sound-er money long term. 20/ Anything that causes normal people to consider new forms of money (apart from their default position of \"my nation, my currency\") is a good thing. Libra will crack open further global discussion about what money is, and that sunshine will hurt fiat, and help all sound monies.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"61417559"},"id_str":"61417559","name":"Erik Voorhees","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"346277"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3344"},"created_at":"Thu Jul 30 06:58:21 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"12725"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"20"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2940"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"15921"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"147"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"796"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.22435"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

[1] I was president of my GSA too, then organized LGBTQ youth on the early internet, then studied adolescent psych at Harvard. I've got something to say about high-school GSAs in America. 1/ A GSA serve three purposes: support, education, and activism. SUPPORT means it is a safe place to be yourself if you are LGBTQ. You can meet other LGBTQ kids and allies there, as well as safe adults. You can make friends who will love you for who you are. 2/ This is important because LGBTQ youth are at higher risk than their straight peers for drug abuse, sexual exploitation, and suicide [2] largely because they are far more likely to lose parental support before they have the maturity and resources to make it on their own. 3/ 40% of homeless youth in the US are LGBTQ. [3] Having accepting friends can be the difference between a place to stay and survival prostitution, and in dark moments is the difference between life and death. 4/ EDUCATION means teaching your fellow students who aren’t in the GSA - and let’s be real, usually your teachers and even counselors - what it is like to be a young LGBTQ person. 5/ People have weird ideas about this: they could think bi means you’re trying to have sex with everyone, or that gay means you are going to prey on children. You can lean on statistics and expert sources, but the most effective education is putting yourself out there. 6/ You have to allow yourself to be seen so that your entire being can make the point “I’m more like you than you realize. My life has value just like yours does.” And GSA kids do this in conversations, newspaper columns, and in-class speeches all the time. 7/ Sidebar: I’ve spent the last 10 years working in the tech industry, and I've been sent to “leadership narrative” classes where executive coaches explain the value of storytelling to create empathy and motivate change. Duh. I learned that lesson at 16 in the GSA! 8/ ACTIVISM, the most important purpose of the GSA. It’s not enough to console each other about the indignities or violences of being LGBTQ in high school, and it’s not enough to explain yourself to others and ask for their kindness. 9/ Activism means seizing the reins and changing things. Because when you are LGBTQ, changing things is a survival skill. 10/ The same tactics you use to convince the Winter Formal Committee to be inclusive of same-sex couples will serve you in adulthood when you have to convince your employer to extend benefits to your partner, or convince your corporation to adequately cover trans healthcare. 11/ You can organize for changes in your school and your community, and in doing so you can understand yourself in the context of other human struggles for civil rights and dignity. You find solidarity with other marginalize people whose struggles are the same but also different. 12/ You learn to organize across race and class to form stronger movements that include everyone. You learn that you get better results by pushing those most directly impacted to the front, and passing the mic to those whose voices we hear the least. 13/ I see this strategy in how the #ParklandStudents were able to be everywhere: in DC, at the Florida state house, at Rubio's town hall, in the NYTimes. They always passed the mic around and used their diverse personal stories to hammer the same point over and over again. 14/ Student activism in GSAs builds lifelong skills, but it’s also about survival because **activism is a way through trauma.** And here’s the thing: everyone I know who came out in their teenage years experienced trauma. 15/ I saw friends lose their homes and their families. I lost friends to suicide. I knew a girl who was raped in order to “cure” her of being gay. I knew a boy who was beaten, nearly to death, for holding hands with another boy. All before I was 20. 16/ The core teaching of GSAs is that in these moments of pain, when you feel powerless and beaten down by the brokenness of the world, you can do something. You can take your pain, your grief, and your rage, and you can roll it out into the world as change. 17/ When you take unfathomable losses you can’t undo what’s happened but you can fight on for your fallen friends, in their names, until you fix it for younger people. You can save someone else. And in saving them, you can save yourself. 18/ I see this in the #ParklandStudents and I understand what is fueling them, and because of that, I believe in them with all my heart. Those of us who are older can form up behind them with our resources and our networks, or get out of their way. 19/ From this 31 year old former student activist to @Emma4Change, @davidhogg111, @sarahchad_ and all their friends and classmates: ride on you beautiful survivors. Take your pain, roll it out into the world, and show us the way.

But here's why Northam referring to the \"20. and Odd Negroes\" of 1619 is so problematic: An historiographical thread. 1/ The idea that the first Africans in Virginia might have been indentured servants goes back a long ways. Oscar and Mary Handlin wrote an article about this in 1950. 2/ Part of what the Handlins were wrestling with was the early absence of laws about slavery and what constituted slave status. This is a problem for historians of Virginia and of the early English Caribbean as well. 3/ It's a chicken and egg problem: do laws enshrine practices that are already custom, or are laws aspirational, attempting to create the slaveholding world that wealthy Virginians wanted? 4/ So you can see why some historians took both the absence of positive law regarding enslaved people and the fact that a few Africans did become free and set up their own households and made arguments about fluidity of status in the very early part of the 1600s. 5/ Edmund Morgan did this to an extent too in his 1975 American Slavery, American Freedom. Drake, Raleigh, and others saw enslaved people in SPanish territories and maroons as potential allies. 6/ Then in the 1970s and 1980s there was a big (and justified) push to see agency for enslaved people. In VA this took the form of a lot of curiosity about those early free blacks. So Breen and Innes's book Myne Owne Ground, about the JOhnson, Driggus, Payne, &amp; other families... 7/ It's fascinating, the small cadre of interrelated free black families on the eastern shore. The problem is historians started to make these families typical. They weren't. They were Exceptional. 8/ There's a reason they settled on the eastern shore, well away from most of the great tobacco grandees around Jamestown. They were looking to get away. And, ultimately, their efforts were unsuccessful. 9/ The Johnsons eventually had to flee to Maryland. Emanuel Driggus might even have been reenslaved by the end of his life (mid-1670s) though the evidence is ambiguous. 10/ The narrative of early fluidity and of the free blacks of the eastern shore has combined into a popular narrative of English/white innocence abt slavery. The English didn't really know what they were doing. That slavery in this period was easily escapeable &amp; not a big deal. 11/ Of course there are plenty of historians (and plenty of historical evidence) countering that kind of position. Winthrop Jordan and his unthinking decision (1968). Mike Guasco's Slaves and Englishmen (2014) really destroys that mythology. 12/ Guasco showed that the English knew A LOT about slavery when they ventured into the Atlantic. They wanted enslaved people in Virginia, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. There was no assumption of indentured servitude for Africans in 1619 in VA. 13/ Though some Africans were able to come to private arrangements with slaveholders early on, those arrangements became less and less possible QUITE QUICKLY. 14/ John Coombs has done quite a bit of work on this, hopefully his book will be out soon. Another book on this Ibram Kendi's Stamped from the Beginning. 15/ While mid-twentieth-century historians were wrestling in good faith with the question of legal status of early Africans in the English Atlantic, there has been so much work done since then. The Africans-as-servants narrative is no longer tenable. 16/ The \"20. and Odd Negroes\" of 1619 were not intended to be servants. (See both Sluiter and Thornton on this in the WMQ.) 17/ When Northam said this morning that those people were servants, he was not engaging an earlier historiography. He was engaging a narrative of white innocence, of Virginian innocence, a narrative that slavery wasn't that bad. 18/ Northam joins a long line of people who want to maintain white innocence about race and slavery by equating slavery and indentured servitude. That's a bad idea, esp since this year white Virginians has an opportunity to honestly confront a pretty horrifying past. 19/ TL;DR: the Africans who arrived in Virginia in 1619 were not indentured servants. Saying they were deliberately effaces the long and violent history of slavery in Virginia and elsewhere. fin/","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"140665322"},"id_str":"140665322","name":"Doctor Historianess","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"6764"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1740"},"created_at":"Thu May 06 03:12:53 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"131606"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"20"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1935"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"8181"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"97"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"409"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.90319"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

The doors are swinging shut against the caravan organizers while the wall continues to go up. Now that the funding is in hand to deal with the surge of illegals at the border, Trump's already moving on to demanding fixes to the asylum system, which the Democrats have been exploiting. Before this over he'll have gotten them to cave on that, too. Once Trump is reelected in 2020, we'll get the implementation of e-verify for citizenship status to qualify for welfare benefits. You'll see MILLIONS self deport when the federal welfare $$$ gets cut off because they can't stay on the taxpayer's dime any more. But Trump's got to do this one step at a time, facing opposition the whole way. You can't even get some so-called Trump supporters to admit the wall's going up, of course they're going to feed you narratives about how Trump right now is LOSING THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE to Democrats. Mexico closing it's own border &amp; sending troops to keep the illegals from passing through? Not happening, you're being lied to. Guatemala &amp; others suddenly taking action to crack down on caravan organizers to keep that sweet, sweet US aid $ flowing from DC? It's an illusion! Trump just getting Pelosi to very publicly CAVE on the border funding after she promised a massive fight over the dueling R Senate/D House bills? This is actually a massive DEFEAT for Trump! Again I'm struck by the truth of why Wictor is never coming back to Twitter. Doom criers out there can spin any minor setback into a MAJOR CATASTROPHE THAT MEANS THE END OF THE REPUBLIC. They can even take a big Trump win &amp; with wave of their hands turn it into a embarrassing defeat. And they do this just to get YOUR ATTENTION, your clicks, your views. I'll ***never*** abuse my followers like that. Everybody calm down. Trump is winning &amp; he'll continue to win. /end LOL look how Politico described what just happened in this email news alert: \"Pelosi bows to McConnell\" If highly partisan Politico can see this for the huge defeat for Pelosi &amp; Democrats that it is, why can't people who **call themselves** \"Trump supporters\"? 🤔 https://t.co/ZVf0XSwPDA Pound sand, you loser.

The far Left 'moderate' wing of the Party led by Pelosi recognized they'd been completely outmaneuvered here and it was time to take the L &amp; move on. Meanwhile the far FAR Left extreme wing of the party, of which AOC is now the public face wants all or nothing on every issue. AOC wants Sherman's march through Georgia, burn everything down, leave nothing for the enemy! Pelosi just handed over the sword at Appomattox.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184141"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"291"},"texto":"When you're leaving a big company to interview at a startup, there are some hidden questions you might not know to ask. Not all startup jobs are created equal; without the right info, you could make a bad choice. Here are 4 questions you should ask in a startup interview loop: 1) How much money does the company have in the bank? OK, yes: this sounds super crass... an embarrassingly direct question. But it is also incredibly crucial, because without this info, you have no idea what kind of situation you are potentially walking into. You would never ask this question at a megacorp because, well, the answer is usually \"infinite money.\" The cash position of a public company is also usually freely available. Besides, you probably wouldn't be talking to someone who could give you a direct answer anyway! 🤑 But at a startup, everything is impacted by money. For example: * How free is the company to build towards its vision? * How likely is the leadership to make desperate/rash decisions? * Will you have access to the resources you need to do a good job? There are lots of less-gosh ways to ask this question, like: \"how strong is the company's financial position?\" And be prepared, the answer might sound more like \"here's what % of our Series B is still in the bank\" or \"here's how many more months of runway we have.\" These are ok! But by not asking, you have no idea what you are signing up for. And if a founder/senior member of the team isn't willing to give you *some sort of answer here*, that is a big red flag. They may be hiding something you won't find out about until you start work. 2) Tell me about a time the founders disagreed. What happened? In any startup with multiple founders (most of them!) the founder working relationship can make or break the company. If it is wonderful, the company may thrive whereas if it is toxic, nothing can save it. Notice the phrasing of the question. As a candidate, just like as an interviewer, you must practice behavioral interviewing. Don't ask \"how do the founders handle disagreement?\" Any smart person can answer that well: “They talk, hear each other's perspectives, and work it out!” Instead ask the question the behavioral way: \"Tell me about a time...\" This forces the answer to be specific and real. Founders always have some disagreement; if they own that and show they know how to handle it, it is a powerful positive signal about the company. Note: Be especially wary if you are interviewing with a founder and they repeatedly answer your specific questions about this by taking the topic back into the abstract. This could show that they are not transparent, not self-aware, deceitful, or all three. 3) What is the role of the company’s board of directors? I'll be honest. During the 16 years I worked at Microsoft, I am not sure I could have named anyone on the board. Bill Gates? The Netflix guy? 🤷🏼‍♂️ It just wasn't in any way germane to the day-to-day of working there. In a startup, however, the company's relationship with its board could have a huge impact on whether you want to work there. If you are talking to a founder or senior exec, look for words of alignment and respect. Not snark or 🙄 or \"ugh, the board, don't get me started.” If interviewing with a more junior employee, a great answer might well be \"No idea, I’ve only seen them in the office once.” A board that is out of the way operationally, helping behind-the-scenes but not interfering, is a good sign that there's a healthy relationship there. Fun story: I once interviewed for a senior job at a tech startup. I went with the CEO to meet the board for a last round of interviews. The first board member got me into a room and started with: \"Hi! FYI. you can't tell him, but we are firing the CEO.\" AWKWARD. Um, kthxbye. 🛫 4) Tell me about the changes you’ve experienced at the company over the last year. A big company is pretty much the same year after year. Working there in 2017 is the same as working there in 2018. The best startups, on the other hand, are growing, changing, strengthening. The single best way to predict the future is by analyzing the past. And so by asking your interviewer not \"where do you expect to be in a year\" but \"what have you experienced in the last year\", you get a window into what the actual the pace of growth is at the company. A great, thoughtful answer about the ways the company is growing is a huge plus. A positive is often: \"wow, I can't believe how much we've done/grown/changed/built when I think about it.\" A worrisome answer is \"honestly, it's about the same.\" When startups stagnate, they die. Hear the stories about what the last 12 months were like, and use that to gauge whether it would be an exciting place to spend your next few years. Companies that are thoughtfully growing employ people with a strong growth mindset, creating an amazing place to learn and build. Last thing: Don't be afraid to ask these things. 💪🏼 You have the right to ask direct questions in your interview. As a founder, I relish being able to share info about our company. If you get vague answers/hostility, especially from senior people, this is a bad sign. Run away! Startup interviews require you to probe differently than megacorp interviews. This is a good thing! What you learn will help you find the place that's a strong match for you. Be prepared to ask the right questions, and you'll be one step closer to landing your dream startup job.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14533639"},"id_str":"14533639","name":"Jensen Harris","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"7117"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"178"},"created_at":"Fri Apr 25 20:27:08 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"678"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"20"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2043"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"8995"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"102"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"450"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.1843"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector. Time for a thread The world is being shaped in large part by two long-time trends: first, our lives are increasingly dematerialized, consisting of consuming and generating information online, both at work and at home. Second, AI is getting ever smarter. These two trends overlap at the level of the algorithms that shape our digital content consumption. Opaque social media algorithms get to decide, to an ever-increasing extent, which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get Integrated over many years of exposure, the algorithmic curation of the information we consume gives the systems in charge considerable power over our lives, over who we become. By moving our lives to the digital realm, we become vulnerable to that which rules it -- AI algorithms If Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you’ll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your political beliefs and your worldview This is not quite news, as Facebook has been known to run since at least 2013 a series of experiments in which they were able to successfully control the moods and decisions of unwitting users by tuning their newsfeeds’ contents, as well as prediction user's future decisions In short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you’re looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop. A loop in which you observe the current state of your targets and keep tuning what information you feed them, until you start observing the opinions and behaviors you wanted to see A good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us This is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective Some of them have been used for a long time in advertising (e.g. positive/negative social reinforcement), but in a very weak, un-targeted form. From an information security perspective, you would call these \"vulnerabilities\": known exploits that can be used to take over a system. In the case of the human mind, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They’re in our DNA. They're our psychology. On a personal level, we have no practical way to defend ourselves against them. The human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume. Importantly, mass population control -- in particular political control -- arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don’t need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat. So, if mass population control is already possible today -- in theory -- why hasn’t the world ended yet? In short, I think it’s because we’re really bad at AI. But that may be about to change. You see, our technical capabilities are the bottleneck here. Until 2015, all ad targeting algorithms across the industry were running on mere logistic regression. In fact, that’s still true to a large extent today -- only the biggest players have switched to more advanced models. It is the reason why so many of the ads you see online seem desperately irrelevant. They aren't that sophisticated. Likewise, the social media bots used by hostile state actors to sway public opinion have little to no AI in them. They’re all extremely primitive. For now. AI has been making fast progress in recent years, and that progress is only beginning to get deployed in targeting algorithms and social media bots. Deep learning has only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks around 2016. Facebook has invested massively in it Who knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader in the field. What does that tell you? What do you use AI/RL for when your product is a newsfeed? We’re looking at a powerful entity that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of over two billion humans, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. Personally, it really scares me If you work in AI, please don't help them. Don't play their game. Don't participate in their research ecosystem.

There is no source close to President Trump disseminating his secret/real agenda via 8chan. Q employs the same tactics that Cult leaders use to control and manipulate their flock. This is true whether you BELIEVE Q or simply follow for the info. https://t.co/wFgSIBH1MQ 2) Regardless of whether YOU PERSONALLY have been sucked in, Q remains a DANGER because of how many HAVE become True Believers. There is a contingent of people who will follow and believe no matter what. Just this week Q pointed his faithful at @SebGorka and the MAGA Coalition. 3) To understand the danger of Q, you must first understand the mechanism by which it operates Q is both a complex and a simple Con The basic outline of a con. 1. Find a mark 2. Gain Trust 3. Exploit Trust The complexity of this con comes from the variety of people susceptible 4) Q found his marks by presenting the world with an interesting puzzle to solve. It catered to people who enjoy finding patterns. This was important because finding patterns would be very necessary when building trust later. How do you gain trust anonymously? 5) To gain trust quickly, you must exploit the human mind and hijack its reasoning centers. 1. Get the Brain's attention 2. Tell them to think for themselves 3. Drop vague clues about your secret knowledge 4. Wait for them to bring you the \"solved puzzle\" 5. Drop more clues 6) It is THE SAME technique used by a Psychic Psychics provide a framework in which a person can tell the Reader what they WANT to be true without realizing The brain places higher importance on \"Hits\" than \"Misses\" Q only has to get a few things right to achieve Oracle status 7) Qproofs are a running list of all the times \"Q has proven that he is real\" In reality they are a collection of the HITS over the lifetime of the con. You will notice there is no running total of all the MISSES Which brings us to another tactic used to control and manipulate 8) Disinformation is Necessary Once Trust has been established, this is the failsafe mechanism. In order to keep the con going, the leader must constantly give new insight to his followers. This requires new predictions and new insider knowledge. But what if he is wrong?? 9) Introducing the idea that the Leader must sometimes lie or mislead is a way to keep anyone within the flock from questioning the legitimacy of the string of predictions. A failed prediction was a distraction. Only the predictions that turn out to be true were real. 10) Programming I haven't glanced at the comments to this yet, but let me make a startling prediction. Trust me, I am psychic. \"All for a LARP\" #WWG1WGA A meme saying \"Q is the only cult that tells you to think for yourself\" \"Enjoy the Show\" \"Shill\" \"Fake MAGA\" 11) These are preprogrammed responses. The leader unites the faithful under banners of common understanding. Phrases and Buzzwords are used as triggers. While the leader tells everyone to \"Think for yourself\" they encourage followers to shut down and convert non-believers. 12) This strategy is ALMOST ALWAYS present within a con or cult. The mantra is \"We want everyone to think for themselves... but if you don't see the light, you are either too dumb to see it or WORSE an agent of evil.\" The con relies on the faithful confirming each others bias. 13) The Danger The danger in Q is not in the specific teaching or information being given out. It is in the devotion of the flock. Those that are in deep and fully believe will defend their belief to the Nth degree. It is physically painful to admit that you have been fooled. 14) We have seen many such believers(I'm certain there are some in the comments) lashing out at anyone that dares to tell them the truth about Q. This is not the behavior of an enlightened flock, but the actions of an angry cultist. The thought of being wrong is terrifying. 15) I myself am not terrified of being wrong. If Trump came out an hour from now and said, I have been working with Q from 8chan, I would say... what a weird way to get your message out... I was totally wrong. I don't fear being wrong, nor do I lash out at Q followers. 16) I have been systematically attacked for over a year by Q followers. IN EVERY CASE I have been on the defensive, not the offensive. I have been called a Shill, Fake MAGA, a Hillary Lover, a Paytriot, controlled opposition a moron, etc EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR 17) My biggest concern is this. All cons eventually fall apart. When gauging the fallout from a collapse, one must look at what the faithful believe. In this case, there are many that believe that Democrats who participated in SpyGate should face the death penalty. 18) What will those people do when the framework that told them that \"Their enemies would pay for their crimes\" falls apart. A certain percentage(not small) will be furious. Some of them may decide to take matters into their own hands. The end result is violence. 19) What will the Leader do to restore order as the con falls down around them? They will defend the Lie in any way they can. If this means destroying good people, OR EVEN TURNING ON THE PRESIDENT. They Will. MANY but not all will follow them to their own destruction. 20) The danger of Q lies in NOT KNOWING THE LEADERS INTENTIONS. The faithful MUST assume that his intentions are good, and the most devoted will do so blindly. IMO THE ONLY and EVENTUAL outcome of Q is division, destruction, and many good people being led astray. Thanks for Listening... For those of you that are mad at me... I trust that you can find the Block or Unfollow button. These are my thoughts and they haven't changed in more than a year.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184144"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"294"},"texto":"1) One of the most jaw-dropping discoveries I made while researching “The Autism Vaccine” took place in Austria. I was initially intrigued by the autism story when I realized that the first time aluminum had been used in a U.S. pediatric vaccine was 1932. https://t.co/LcHlyDAyss 2) This was less than a year before Donald Triplett—the first child ever diagnosed with autism—was born. Knowing scientific studies have pointed towards elevated levels of aluminum in children with autism, I began to research when this new ingredient was first added. https://t.co/ilQGoOUruR 3) The story of WHY it was added is fascinating, but WHEN it was added—1932—is important. Before that year, you will only find a rare mention of a few kids here &amp; there resembling the modern diagnosis of autism. https://t.co/8tesoP9k8Y 4) It was extremely rare before 1932—so rare that even the most prominent child psychiatrist in the country had never seen any children with it. In 1932, the decision was made to add aluminum to a vaccine because it seemed to make it work better. https://t.co/KBEFZeTrH2 5) Within a year or two, accounts of parents noticing aloneness in their children or obsession with repetitive patterns &amp; behaviors began to appear. https://t.co/e1mpfMfRvh 6) In Baltimore, a famous child psychiatrist named Leo Kanner began to see children—mostly boys—show up in his Baltimore clinic with a strange set of behaviors he had never even heard of before. https://t.co/jAcNQxTARP 7) In 1935, Kanner published a 500-page book on childhood psychiatry—the largest such book in the world. He mentioned nothing resembling autism. It's clear he'd never seen or heard of anything like the children who were now being brought to his clinic. https://t.co/PJyY40YeKJ https://t.co/ip96IhdPU8 8) This coincidence in time was enough to make me want to understand if there was a possible relationship between the addition of aluminum in 1932 &amp; the sudden appearance of children with autism. https://t.co/TA1kL7JXav 9) I explored this lead for quite a while &amp; became convinced they were related. It seemed unlikely that the one country in the world that made this change would begin to see autism within a year after having done so. https://t.co/EvG2RndvPy 10) I realized later the U.S wasn’t the only country to make this change. There was another, &amp; in fact, like the United States, they were struggling with a massive outbreak of diphtheria. https://t.co/S1AaJ4KcXE 11) This other country had begun to launch nationwide campaigns to have every child immunized—with the new aluminum-containing vaccine. https://t.co/wTdts7qRCd 12) The US was using a very nasty type of aluminum called potassium aluminum sulfate, sometimes called potash. Scientists in Denmark had experimented with something different—aluminum hydroxide &amp; noticed that this type of aluminum caused fewer granulomas, or nodules than potash. https://t.co/i58AylhKtB 13) In Austria, they noticed that aluminum hydroxide seemed to cause fewer problems so in their national campaign to immunize their children against diphtheria, they added aluminum hydroxide to their vaccines. https://t.co/0JivAYp08u 14) This would be the first time thousands of children would be injected with a metallic compound in recorded history. A few may have received mercury injections during experiments for congenital syphilis, but this was a nationwide campaign. https://t.co/YeI9yiODCY 15) If you don’t know the story, there was another child psychiatrist in Austria who began to see young patients show up at his clinic—their parents confused as to what had happened to their previously healthy children. https://t.co/1It9f6M5iI 16) Hans Asperger was at a loss to explain what was causing these children to experience strange neurological symptoms. He saw over 200 children—every one of them boys, &amp; they closely resembled the children Leo Kanner had seen in Baltimore. https://t.co/142V0NJuPt 17) It should strike anyone as remarkable that the two countries which launched nationwide diphtheria immunization campaigns in the 1930s using a new aluminum-containing shot were the very two countries where autism was first noticed &amp; documented. https://t.co/vBlIeodUZ4 18) Two countries began running nationwide immunization campaigns for their children, with a new vaccine that contained aluminum, &amp; within a year or so, those same two countries began to see the appearance of a new neurological disorder that would later be called autism. https://t.co/KwPFpa3JgC 19) The United States &amp; Austria—the two countries that used this new aluminum-containing vaccine in the 1930s, and the two countries where the case reports first describing autism appeared.

I do have a few things to say, but I doubt you'll like it. 1/ First: Give credit where credit is due. Liberals, progressives, the media, never-Trumpers on the right, and even some hardcore Trump supporters have been complaining that Trump hasn't visited deployed American Troops. Now he has. 2/ Was it a political stunt? Of course it was. Was it for his own self-aggrandizement? Surely you'd expect no less NOW? Was because he was shamed into going? No doubt. Was it the only way he could get a plane ride to Mar-a-Lago? I dunno. 3/ There are myriad reasons to criticize Trump. But attacking him for doing what you demanded he do is the kind of hypocrisy conservatives did to Obama and it's just as petty and small-minded coming from the left as it was from the right. 4/ Second: Operational Security. Trump's visit outed a covert special operations team. SEALs. Compromising their ability to carry out the mission and perhaps even putting their lives at even greater risk than they normally are. That's not Trump's fault. It's not. 5/ Not directly. I'd love to blame Trump, or his staff, or the photographers, or the press. But it's not their fault. They don't know any better. They should, but they don't. 6/ It's the US Military's fault, specifically the commanders on the ground. The Theater Commander. The base commander. The Special Operations Commander. The SEAL team leaders. THEY are the ones responsible for Operational Security. They're the experts. 7/ The press is in and out of US bases in theater on a daily basis, the enemy is watching all of the time, not just when the President happens to show up. Military members are supposed know and enforce OPSEC, their very lives depend on it. 8/ SPECOPS guys are supposed to be invisible, that's their job. But, instead of maintaining proper OPSEC, keeping a low profile, they're grabbed all their gear and posed for selfies and press pictures with Trump in front of the cameras. That's on the military. 9/ It's out in the open now and the military will have to deal with it. Either send these guys home or live (or die) with the increased risk and possible mission fail. They should have known better. They DO know better. They ALL know better. There's no excuse for this. 10/ That takes us to the 3rd and most important point: Pictures of military officers decked out in MAGA hats and waving Trump flags. This is a violation of military regulation, specifically DoD Directive 1344.10 \"Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces.\" 11/ Military personnel are allowed to participate in political activities OUTSIDE OF THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITIES. A member of the uniformed services can participate in lawful political activity as a private citizen. You may NOT do so in uniform, or in any official capacity. 12/ And as an officer, what you are expressly prohibited from doing is attempting to influence your subordinates' political views in any fashion whatsoever. That is abuse of power and prohibited by a variety of regulations and laws. 13/ It's not just that Air Force captain waving the Trump flag, it's the full bird colonel not ten feet away -- along with a dozen other senior officers -- who are not correcting her. 14/ These officers have compromised their ability to command. Subordinates who hold differing political views would have to suspect prejudicial treatment in such a command environment, which is specifically why this type of partisan behavior in uniform is strictly prohibited. 15/ And that's the thing, isn't it? That's the thing right there. These officers know better, or should. And these aren't separate items, one, two, and three. No, they're all part of a set piece. 16/ They say a fish rots from the head. That's what you're looking at here. Rot. From the top down. Poor leadership starting with the Commander-in-Chief, permeating the Officer and NCO ranks. Partisanship. Open bias in the ranks. Slack discipline. A lack of professionalism. 17/ No wonder they failed to maintain operational security. 18/ This is another indicator of rot, like those collisions at sea last year, or the departure of actual professionals from senior civilian positions -- and the mockery and belittling of the same by the Commander-in-Chief himself -- and the demands for purity in the ranks. 19/ This is how a military falls apart, how discipline decays, how the mission fails, how rot grows in the ranks, how leadership is replaced with amateurs and ineffectual fools, how military service become a haven for thugs instead of the profession of a nation's best. 20/ THIS is how a professional service becomes a tool of oppression and fascism under the camouflage of patriotism and national security. You're watching it happen. 21/21","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"41223126"},"id_str":"41223126","name":"Stonekettle","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"127590"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1353"},"created_at":"Tue May 19 22:02:20 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"98432"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"21"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3836"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"19474"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"183"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"927"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.23579"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It's really hard to see a black woman's work be misused over and over again by progressives/well meaning ppl https://t.co/TFn3KwEX08 So, Don Cheadle wearing a shirt that ways \"protect trans kids\" is amazing and I support the hell out of it, but it is not \"intersectionality\". That's not what that means. Within, I'd say, mostly white political spaces, it's very easy for people to confuse \"Intersectionality\" with \"inclusion\" or \"being considerate\" for other identities. It's also easy to think it's all about a combination of identities, but it's not exactly that. Firstly, I've made a really short and easy to understand video about this on my Youtube Channel. Check it out if you'd like to hear this explanation rather than read it. https://t.co/NMnoyr3WK2 Intersectionality was a term coined by a black woman named Kimberle Crenshaw, (who by the way is still alive @sandylocks ), in 1989. It's a term that she created in her paper she wrote for the Chicago Legal Forum. Full Text can be found here: https://t.co/rU9bAkvp5S To summarize what she meant when she defined intersectionality: It was about how black women were erased in conversations about discrimination because the feminist movement and the civil rights movement focused largely on its most privileged members. So feminism, at the time (and arguably still) focused largely on white women's experiences with sexism and the civil rights movement focused, at the time (and arguably still) focused on how black men experienced racism. So black women's experiences had to be measured against that Meaning that in several legal cases, explained in the document and my video, if a black woman's experiences with discrimination weren't paralleled to how black men experience racism and white women experience sexism, their cases were dismissed or thrown out. So you had cases where black women would sue a company for racial discrimination and then you'd have the judge say that it was impossible for that to be true, because they currently employed black people. The problem was, the black people were all men. And you'd have cases where they'd sue the company for being sexist, but they'd say that was impossible because they currently employed several women. The problem being, those women were all white. And then you'd have cases where black women sued on behalf of themselves and black men for racial discrimination and their experiences were dismissed because their experiences as a woman, don't negate their experiences as men. Black women were unable to represent their own. So the bones of intersectionality really has to do with the ways in which black women, specifically, have been ignored and dismissed because of the more mainstream view of what sexism and racism looks like. So, intersectionality is about viewing discrimination outside of the single axis view of discrimination where individuals are only impacted by singular forms of discrimination (white women by sexism, black men by racism). It's an acknowledgement that sometimes these things intersect. That sometimes it's racism and sexism, sometimes it's just racism and sometimes it's just sexism. But it's about opening up to the idea that it isn't just one of these things. It can frequently be more than one. Which is why people often think it's about multiple identities, but really it's about multiple types of discrimination that can frequently inform each other. For example, Women who are disabled are at a higher risk of sexual assault. When those women are black, that increases their risk of sexual assault. So in that situation, you have people who have multiple identities, that face discriminations that often inform each other. What Don Cheadle is doing here is called allyship. He is using his privilege as a cis man w/ access to an audience to spotlight transgender children. He is advocating for their protection and I think, within the scope of Hollywood, this is pretty radical and took a lot of guts. I think he should be celebrated for it. But please do not call this \"intersectional\", because it isn't. Him being a black man... and an adult isn't really inching near what we're discussing when we discuss intersectionality. Intersectionality CAN look like a person outside of one group advocating for another, but the optics of this aren't quite that. It's allyship and I think that should be celebrated without misusing the work of a black woman and a scholar. The meaning and use of Intersectionality has expanded beyond black women's experiences, but it will always be about understanding the ways in which multiple types of discrimination inform each other. As a black woman who is trans, and thus at a higher risk of violence, it's important to me and my understanding of the world. Let's not warp it into a feel good thing about a mixture of identities. Let's keep the definition and use consistent because it is important.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1706101310"},"id_str":"1706101310","name":"Kat Blaque","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"60048"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2936"},"created_at":"Wed Aug 28 02:11:23 +0000 2013","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"24895"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"21"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"11208"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"65107"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"534"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3100"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.06952"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

The Southwest loves making deities out of humans and the North is always there to help us demystify them. Thanks to Southwest media and intellectuals the hype goes on. The hype that has turned humans to deities did not start today in the Southwest, it started long ago when the word ‘risha’ a cushite/Semitic word was corrupted to Orisha and the meaning which was something saintly or divine was elevated to mean deity- funny! I am sure many do not know that Sango was named Olufiran, and was the offspring of a marriage between a Northern princess and the Alaafin of Oyo at the time. We all just know about the deity status because that is what interests us, no research nothing, deify and worship. And so it was till the times of Afonja, who became so headstrong and powerful to the point he believed, he challenge the authority of the Oba and aligned with Fulani warriors- Alimi and his men. Despite all warnings Afonja got carried away and lay all trust with the Fulani’s Afonja would leave no stone unturned destroyed the unity of the yorubas and thought he had established his own kingdom, he was elevated by praise singers but little did he know those who helped him rise were planning his own downfall and no one would be around to help him Afonja has weakened the hold of Oyo in the Southwest, so when the Fulani’s turned on him in ilorin, there was no saving grace for him, he had burned bridges for his own ego and personal pride and he suffered ultimately and his descendants would end up being serfs with his tenants Afonja lost Ilorin to Alimi and his bandwagon of Fulani warriors. The story hasn’t been different in my own life time and experience. The Southwest has always produces tin-gods whose greed and ego will never let them do the right thing at the right time Most yoruba people deify Awolowo and truth is, I don’t see him as being extraordinary, I see Awolowo, the same way I see modern politicians, opportunists who at best mask as saints with hypocrisy. The same Awolowo who stirred the waters that brought us into ethnic politics &amp; hate Awolowo, who was the sole reason for the first coup, would turn around &amp; work against a region which was as progressive as his and help starve millions of children to death under sanctuary of ‘all is fair and just in war’. A man who said ‘we can’t feed our enemies’ to brothers Yes, the Igbos are our brothers and if Awolowo was anything near a nationalist, he should have watched his actions and words during the Biafra war. But no, he spoke all sorts and later wanted to be president of the same country he helped decimate a region in it And later became bitter and cursed people because he never became president, how did Awo ever think he would be President? The problem with Southwesterners is that we play into the hands of the Fulani masters of the game and when used and dumped we get bitter The case of MKO abiola was no different, he invested in media and was almost a demigod. There are allegations that he helped bring military govts to power and the same military government was the end of him. The same Abacha he helped bring to power made him suffer till he died One would have though present day politicians would learn from Awolowo, Abiola, all who had godlike fame and were reputed to dine with gods but as usual, they were dealt with by the master strategists of the Fulani oligarchy Same thing is playing out now. Bola Tinubu is no different from Awolow and truth is, he may end up like him, bitter and vengeful. Like Afonja Tinubu has destroyed all the strongholds of the Yoruba in the southwest and all Yoruba institutions have been bastardized Whilst the Fulani oligarchy ensure their structure is intact and keep working on a cohesive structure for the North, Tinubu has destroyed reference for Yoruba institutions. He has had his minions attack a respected Yoruba general like Obasanjo on social media You will never see Northerner nor member of Arewa twitter speak ill of any of their generals but Tinubu has ensured that our Yoruba kids becomes the mannerless bunch on twitter cursing at Yoruba elders with dissenting voices. He has reduced elder leadership to rubbles The different Yoruba socio-cultural groups has been destroyed by same individual, not even the Afenifere that brought Tinubu to power has been spared. Even the OPC has been reduced to a ghost of itself, all thanks to the tin-god in Bourdillon Like Afonja, Tinubu is ready to burn all bridges for his Fulani friend. He is willing to sacrifice his own people as pawns all for his selfish ambition and shot at federal politics. The funny thing about this however is how Tinubu thinks the North will support him How Tinubu imagines that the North will allow a southwestern power house to take reins of this country amuses me. Tinubu unfortunately doesn’t realize that he is a greater threat to the Northern Oligarchy than any of us &amp; what protects him are those of us he is trying to destroy Tinubu has no idea that the reason why he hasn’t been destroyed politically is because of people like Obasanjo who know the game of these Northern Oligarchs &amp; plays it to the T. Come 2019, Tinubu is ready to burn all bridges for the sake of his own ‘Alimi’ or should I say Buhari Tinubu has launched offensive against all that can fight for the Yoruba people in the face of oppression, he is enjoying his new found fame in national politics but the day the rain that befell those before him will storm up, he will look around for soldiers and he will find none","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"157487202"},"id_str":"157487202","name":"Ayekooto","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"5518"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"4436"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 20 00:08:48 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"75382"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"21"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2322"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"2883"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"111"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"137"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.80521"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

Just the ten of us, with the communion of saints and angels. My predecessor at the parish had been writing about the practice in the parish bulletin for a few weeks prior to his transfer three Octobers ago. I think he was planning to celebrate ad orientem on occasion throughout Advent, maybe during the week. When I arrived in 2016, I hadn’t given thought to reviving the posture, but I was glad he was planting the seed in people’s minds and hearts. As Jesus related in Friday’s Gospel, “the seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how“ (Mark 4:27). That’s how the Church works. Since returning to Twitter, I started to encounter a refreshing species of Catholic: younger, intelligent, articulate, witty, and devout – “admirandum et imitandum” (to be admired and imitated). A few of the priests among them were promoting a movement they call the #Traddening. The Traddening, I would say, rebrands what Benedict XVI and others have advocated since Vatican II: a “reform of the reform” in Catholic spirituality, teaching, and morality by attending to elements of the sacred Liturgy that had remained always in theory, not often in practice. It’s about re-introducing disparate traditional elements, while allowing God thereby to generate an ethos of mystery that the current scenario seems to have obscured. Bishop Robert Barron frequently names that tune in six words: “Your life is not about you.” Those words run like a thread through all things Catholic, all things Christ—especially the Liturgy. At the root of Traddening is “tradition,“ from the Latin verb tradere, to hand over, to pass along. In his exposition of the central message of the faith, St. Paul declared, “I hand on to you what I myself received.” There’s no originality to Paul and his proclamation. For more detailed understanding of the Traddening, I commend you to such luminaries as Fr. Matt Fish of Washington and Archbishop Alexander Sample of Portland (OR). Priests here and there are implementing traditional liturgical measures, with appropriate instruction. It is no surprise to me that newer generations are responding more openly to the movement. I liken it to the experience of the Jews in last Sunday’s first reading from Nehemiah: newly hearing the Mosaic Law, suddenly, tearfully, they are moved – by what? Moved by its beauty, goodness, and truth, its orientation to unity through distinction. The Law – or rather, the Lord Himself – seizes them, and they are overcome for not having heard it before, perhaps wondering how they could conform themselves to it. Notice it’s not a series of ritual prescriptions, dietary or moral directives per se, but the quasi (?) liturgical revelation of them – the experience conveying the content. Today’s feast of the Presentation of the Lord seemed providentially appropriate for my first* celebration of Mass where Christ is the head and members together faced the rising sun, although by the compass I think we were looking south. *I’m lying: the very first time was a couple years ago in the company of nursing home residents. Some of them are still among us, while Others have fallen asleep. My instructions to them was brief but, I think, fitting. Nobody bat an eye or reported me. This morning I spoke of the light and life of the Infant King dawning on Simeon and Anna. While others would have been blinded by Him, they alone among the Temple occupants were wearing the proper glasses. They were properly oriented to Him. He was the Messiah promised who would, as Malachi said, purify and refine the sons of Levi (the priests among God’s people). “Pur” is Greek for fire. The light of revelation to the nations, the heat to burn away all that is not God. My personal takeaways, besides the Eucharist and Word in every validly celebrated Mass: gone is the sense of opposition, the pressure to perform. Head and Members together offering all prayers, work, joys, and sufferings to the eternal Father in the power of the Holy Spirit. Please God, my liturgical praxis for 15.5 years hasn’t been ill motivated or executed. Traddening principles and practices always appealed to me. I’ve been adopting them piecemeal and unobtrusively, as is suggested. They must become more than a fad or an affectation. A la Ezra, Nehemiah, and the repatriated Jews, newly exposed to the Law and to a doxological worshipping attitude: “Where have You been all my life?” Such a mindset can translate to Liturgy and all the rest, unto its purification. Ongoing thanks to @clericalpod, which has provided information and motivation toward this priest’s ars celebrandi. All to the glory of God and the sanctification of the human race; all to the purification of ecclesial attitudes reductive of the priest to a kind of mascot instead of a Father and Shepherd.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"355985089"},"id_str":"355985089","name":"Fr.

Staffers of Congress family members are also exempt from having to pay back student loans. 3. Members of Congress can retire at full pay after only one term. 4. Members of Congress have exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, under which ordinary citizens must live. For example, they are exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment. And as the latest example, they have exempted themselves from Healthcare Reform, in all of its aspects. We must not tolerate an elite class of such people, elected as public servants and then putting themselves above the law. I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent, or whatever. The self-serving must stop. Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon their states. It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention. IF??? Each person that receives this will forward it on to 20 people, in three days most people in The United States of America will have the message. Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution: \"Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States.\" President Trump is asking everyone to forward this message (text, email, tweet, FB) to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in the United States will have the message. This is an idea that should be passed around, regardless of political party. The TRUMP Rules: Congressional Reform Act of 2017 1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they're out of office. And, no more perks go with them. 2. Congress (past, present, &amp; future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. 3. Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as ALL Americans do. 4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. 5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. 6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people (i.e. NO MORE INSIDER TRADING!!!). 7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen/women. Congress made all these contracts by and for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor and privledge NOT a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators should serve their term(s), then go home and go back to work … not get all kinds of freebies. NO WONDER THEY’RE FIGHTING EVERYTHING HE TRIES! Pass it on!!!! Let's help TRUMP drain the swamp!! Just hold your finger down then hit forward and send it to everyone you know.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818414c"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"302"},"texto":"Thread: I’ve seen a ton of people in the last week - men and women - calling for access to weapons or martial arts training as a response to sexual violence. I get it. It’s an attractive thought. Arm the women so they can have a chance to ‘fight back’, right? Wrong. Here’s why. Firstly, weapons are unreliable as mechanisms to resist violence. What they’re likely to do more than anything is to escalate situations. Preservation of life is always our first instinct. Your rapist might not be planning to kill you, but weapons make it more likely they will. Secondly, people who advocate for the use of weapons do so with the ridiculous assumption that we’ll be able to use them with a clear head and, most importantly, accuracy. Even people trained in the use of weapons struggle with both these things. You want a woman who has been taken by surprise and is TERRIFIED she’s about to be killed to access the kind of laser focused calm needed to best her attacker? With a gun or similar that can be taken from her (because we’re dealing with close range here) and used against her?! Thirdly, even if women were able to do this and come out victorious, it comes with a cost. What you’re asking is for women to accept the possibility of becoming killers, because this is easier for you than accepting the need to address men’s violence. And sure, you can say that it’s me or the other guy. But I don’t want to live in a world where killing people is an acceptable response to violence. I don’t want women or teachers or retail workers or anyone at risk of violence to have to become killers. These arguments have all been made before, but I haven’t really heard much about this last one. Because fourthly, if you want women to carry weapons to protect themselves against danger, do you realise that we perceive potential danger *all the time*? How do we know when it’s time to pull out the gun? When the guy’s staring creepily at us on the tram? When we think he’s slipped something in our drink? When he may or may not be following us home? When the car he’s driving has passed two times already, or when it becomes three? The majority of people who call for women to be armed in response to the *worst* violence they can imagine (rape and murder, because if she’s dead they know she wasn’t lying) don’t believe that men’s violence against women is a problem. They think ‘rape culture’ is a myth. They often believe that women lie, that men are demonised and that feminism has gone too far. The only time they’re willing to confront the reality of violence’s presence in women’s lives is when they can frame a victim in their mind as an ‘innocent angel, taken too soon’. Trust me, they feel very differently about the girls and women who stumble out of hotel rooms and report being sexually assaulted by football players. They do not want to give guns to the girls their sons might rape after the prom. So we need to understand this call to arm women not just as ineffective public policy, but another shifting of the goalposts that keeps men in control of the narrative of men’s violence against women. Women should have guns - but only to kill the ‘real’ rapists, right? I just want to reiterate this point again: significant numbers of people don’t believe women when we report violence perpetrated against us. Especially when the perps are ‘good boys from good families’. Even if arming women to protect them from men’s violence DID work in the short term (as in, preserved her life over his), there is absolutely no way the people who take it upon themselves to decide who’s lying and who’s genuine would truly accept this. And the full brunt of this public retribution would hit marginalised women and WOC the hardest. Cyntoia Brown spent almost two decades in prison after she killed her rapist with a gun - the same weapon people want to give to women to ‘protect’ themselves from rape. In Australia, those most significantly and brutally targeted by sexual violence are Aboriginal women. They’re already at the highest risk of incarceration. You think the right wing gun lobbyist zealots here are going to support them killing their (white) rapists? And listen, I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t fantasised about carrying a flame thrower or a taser or even a gun around with me when confronted with yet another criminal, homicidal attack on a woman in this country. But I’m not a killer and I don’t want to become one. Shit, look at the FURY and OUTRAGE that I still get years after making the ‘kill all men’ joke. Can you imagine how these men would react if women actually started doing it? If women killed the men who were raping them, beating them, threatening them, following them? They would not abide. There’s really only one ethical, effective solution to counter men’s violence against women - and that’s to actually engage with the reality of it. Sexual homicides don’t arise out of the ether. They are rarer than most crimes against women, but they come out of the same bog. TL;DR - We cannot end men’s violence against women by creating and advocating for more violence. No society should rally more enthusiastically around the idea of murder than they do education. Women shouldn’t have to kill in order to live.

I haven't done a thread in a while. Buckle up. 2. In an article I wrote on 1/31/19, I detailed for all of you what I thought the mysterious OIG Summary report released by Horowitz on 1/29 meant. https://t.co/Sn74N8tqKA This report is VITALLY IMPORTANT. https://t.co/pc46NxzOul 3. To summarize, the OIG found that AS A RESULT of conduct (likely DIRECTION or ORDERS) from senior level FBI officials, a government contractor engaged in inherent governmental activities- conduct prohibited by the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulations). 4. The \"inherent governmental activity\" I found that made sense was \"The direction and control of intelligence and counterintelligence operations\". I then went on to describe the 702 abuse. Contractors and the FBI Counterintelligence Division were routinely violating procedure 5. You can read that article here, and please give credit to @themarketswork where it is due- he has done amazing and extensive work on this issue and many more: https://t.co/JkOOovNUVe 6. After unpacking all of that, as we get further down in the report, we see that there is also a PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST violation by the contractor. This further solidified Fusion GPS for me, because Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS (cont) 7. (cont) and because of Bruce Ohr's involvement in this FBI investigation, and because we had Jeff's reporting on his testimony, I surmised that her marriage to Bruce Ohr represented a massive personal conflict of interest. https://t.co/BzriwX9tYG 8. Then I kept digging, and a few days later I found something AMAZING in a court transcript. The transcript was from a case involving FusionGPS. They took their bank to court to try to prevent the HPSCI from subpoenaing their bank records. 9. As part of their defense, they argued the subpoena was too expansive, and that if the government wanted records relating to Steele and the dossier, they would provide JUST THOSE and shouldn't have to provide 2 years worth of financial transactions and records. 10. They argued that would be catastrophic for their business, as all of their clients would be revealed. It would also reveal what JOURNALISTS are on their payroll. Inside of the transcript and in response to that argument I found a STUNNING STATEMENT. https://t.co/uQpYg9sPkx 11. You can read my article about this here: https://t.co/gjag4gq2uW https://t.co/XpjvqNSWMs 12. The government attorney states: \"In addition, the committee is seeking to determine whether there are any connections between Fusion and the intelligence community, which is part of what this information would be designed to obtain\" WOW. 13. So now we know that as early as October of 2017, the HPSCI suspected that FusionGPS had a paid relationship with the IC. This finding further solidified the OIG summary report referencing FUSION GPS. 14. And yesterday we got the final confirmation. In John Solomon's piece from yesterday, he uses VERY specific wording when speaking about Nellie Ohr, and the fact that she too handed her husband a thumb drive with information on Trump/Russia: https://t.co/72PeIRjlkM 15. Jeff had reported this previously (https://t.co/MlQcrjEaDr) however @jsolomonReports uses this language: (cont) https://t.co/HUnlC9HFWf 16. \"And now we learn, from testimony that is still being kept secret from the public, that Ohr admitted to Congress last year that he also took Russia information that his wife, Nellie, assembled against Trump on a computer drive and delivered that to the FBI in 2016...\" (cont) 17. (cont) \" — a revelation that has raised fresh concerns in Congress about a possible conflict of interest.\" It seems to me that the OIG has already found and determined that conflict of interest in his ongoing work into the FISA abuse AND THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OP as a WHOLE 18. It is also making me wonder if FusionGPS wasn't being paid by the government TO COMMISSION the dossier, WHILE ALSO being paid by Clinton via Perkins Coie, and ALSO PAYING JOURNALISTS to write pieces to bolster their work. IN ADDITION 19. I posit that the CIA and Brennan will be making an entrance here in short order, given Nellie's previous relationship with the organization. Brennan went to Reid, Reid went to Congress and Comey. Making sense now? 20. IT IS ALL COMING OUT and I am CONFIDENT there will be accountability. This escapade is a complete TRAVESTY to America, and all of these politicians and corrupt tyrants who attempted to destroy our country will face justice and have sunlight blasted on their misdeeds. 21. If you would like a video report, here it is: https://t.co/q6kH7t69Sd. Please share this thread if you find this work valuable. Slowly but surely.

The NSC's role to staff the President &amp; coordinate the interagency on foreign policy—it is NOT the job of the NSC to map and target domestic political opponents or collude with outside allies to do so. 18/ Scandalous revelations from the Trump White House are so common we become numb to them &amp; often so bananas that folks almost laugh them off. But this is no laughing matter. 19/ The potential weaponization of the NSC to go after domestic opponents represents another dangerous shattering of democratic norms under Trump. 20/ I know there is a lot of outrage fatigue and a dizzying volume and velocity of crazy news these days.

When not writing paeans to southern traditionalism, they saw it as the basis of a coming conservative majority. A short thread: https://t.co/wOk6bhE8jv So, did the NR-style conservatives see southern segregationist Dems as conservatives or allies? Yes, I think they did. Which senators were receiving and subscribing to National Review? In 1960, 7 conservative Congressman and Senators subscribed to NR, two liberals, and two Southerners whose ACA ratings were lower due to party loyalty. https://t.co/hll4Jtz0BM The NR publisher, Bill Rusher saw the most conservative half of the House and Senate as the best audience for the magazine. This included almost all Republicans and “all of the best Democrats, notably the Southerners” incl Eastland, Stennis, Talmadge and Russell. https://t.co/d1yvfsd0aE Strom Thurmond, in his Democratic days, didn't want to miss an issue. https://t.co/vxHsWRFKcb In fact, in 1957 NR ran an interview with Richard Russell (D-Ga.) on why he opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. “All human history teaches us that problems of this nature must be solved by evolution and not by revolution,” he said, striking a consciously conservative tone. Conservative activists and ideologues harbored the dream of breaking free from Eastern liberal influence in the GOP by forging a Midwestern-Southern coalition, making formal the conservative alliance of the 1930s. For instance, this argument by conservative William Bradford Huie in the American Mercury in 1951. \"The Northern Democrats hate the South; they are all elected South-haters; while the Northern Republicans...have turned to Southerners as allies against the collectivist threat.\" https://t.co/kgr2BwZn4A Or Isabel Patterson who argued in 1955 in National Review the New Deal \"Reconstruction\" of the North had broken the historic ties between the South and the Democratic Party. Conservative Democrats might ally with hypothetical dissident Republicans she suggested. This meant NR supported Southern Senators like Harry Byrd. But it also meant winning southern presidential votes (since the national Democratic Party tended liberal) and winning Southern Democratic voters to a newly lily-white Southern GOP. NR's \"chief ideologue,\" Frank Meyer saw Southern Democrats as a key part of the conservative coalition (first 2 photos). Bill Rusher (3rd photo) thought Goldwater running a suicidal campaign was worth it to make a bid for southern whites and therefore shift the GOP right. https://t.co/A490vGsPZR Politically, National Review's favorite candidate Barry Goldwater, who \"hunted where the ducks were,\" was key to making the GOP attractive to southern whites. His anti-labor and, especially, his pro-states' rights views were most attractive alongside his strident anti-communism. https://t.co/wTfqgjv1y8 National Review's editor William F. Buckley asked his friend James J. Kilpatrick, an open segregationist, to report on Goldwater's support in the South in 1963, stressing if \"in good conscience\" he could, non-racial issues. Kilpatrick did. https://t.co/t55BwjRa64 The non-racist basis to Goldwater's southern support is a myth that even contemporary conservatives like Buckley wanted to believe for their own sake. Here Bill Rusher describes southern white support for Goldwater. https://t.co/U3Qe7GHa6L His argument is quite familiar: it's the Democrats with the racist history, it's the backcountry southern Dems who are racist. Southern *Republicans* are constitutionalists and conservatives. They're suburban and educated, not redneck racists. This was already conventional wisdom, that the Southern strategy was a legitimate vote-winning move and that the whites they were winning were not the real racists, as this memo by a Republican pol that Rusher drew from shows. https://t.co/ohrObRnvuo In part it's by conflating upper south support for Ike in the 1950s with deep south support for Goldwater in 1964. But the language of class does a lot of work here: the middle class can't be racist, just the poor. It's an argument NR reversed when talking about liberal cities. It's possible to find instances of people like William F. Buckley criticizing George Wallace. There's a famous Firing Line episode. And, yes, conservative intellectuals were motivated by many more issues than simply racism. But as this thread shows and as I write here, the editors at NR were willfully naive about their own and their supporters racist attitudes and eager to interpret and whitewash segregationist voters and principled conservatives. https://t.co/9mFTLXqzr1. Lastly, I've seen a trend lately where people say \"x couldn't be a conservative, they were a Democrat.\" Not only is this partisan blindness, but it totally flattens history, projecting back a modern understanding of partisan identity and right and left to the past. John Eastland was not a progressive by any understanding of the word. Conservatives insistence on interpreting left/right as about the size of government and assuming progressive/conservative maps easily onto this is a mistake, as I try and unravel here https://t.co/UseCIrIRDC.

Come along if you like. https://t.co/t97aWSje4s 2. It's a rare day that a tweet like this doesn't show up on my TL. This one showed up this morning. Different animals, different places, all one story: save the endangered &lt;focus victim&gt;. 3. There are a few species which are endangered specifically by increasing temperatures, but only a few. The polar bear is one charismatic example. The Florida panther's threat is not temperature related. It's plain ol' habitat destruction, the always and forever big one. 4. We know a few things about extinction. For one thing, we know it's a one way trip. They don't come back. For another thing, we know that it is currently running at about 1000 x the historic rate. For every one species we would have lost in a functioning ecosystem, we lose 1000 4. The way life works is, for every possible place to live and source of food, at least one creature will evolve to live in that place and eat that food from that source. We call that a \"niche.\" When the last weed patch of one certain type is paved over, some species goes extinct 5. Certain special, large, glorious animals become extinct because humans patiently, steadily, kill every last one. That's what happened to the Passenger Pigeon, which used to darken the skies for hours at a time. Imagine watching a flock of birds that blocked the sun, 6. Flying overhead for an hour, blocking the sun the whole time. Imagine the life our fathers saw, and took from us. Now imagine all the life we see, that we are taking from our children and all other humans forever and ever Amen. 7. There are many people today who strongly believe that it is morally wrong to kill an animal and eat it. 8. I have literally never heard one single person take the stand that it is morally wrong to drive the cars that kill millions upon millions of animals and leave their rotting corpses dotted up and down the highways and byways. \"I like my car.\" \"Cars are useful.\" \"We have to...\" 9. If you're old, like I am, you may remember when a road trip on a summer night would leave your windshield nearly opaque with the corpses of bugs. It doesn't happen like that any more. Even the bugs are dying off. They are the foundation of the food chain. 10. Everything either eats bugs, or eats things that eat bugs, or eats things that bugs pollinate. I'm not saying that sweeping billions upon billions of bugs out of the air, smashed on millions upon millions of windshields, made them die off. We invented poisons just for that. 11. But all those billions of smashed bug windshield paint were abruptly, like never before in all of time, extracted from the ecosystem, their ecological purpose unfulfilled. Their bodies didn't even fall to the ground to be eaten. Nothing exists alone. There is only one whole. 11. I was in a conversation with some friends the other day about the usefulness of possums. Possums eat ticks. Possums are probably the number one spring roadkill species. They're slow. When frightened they stop. ❌ 12. We talk quite a bit about global warming, the process by which thermal energy is continually captured by carbon compounds in the atmosphere, particularly CO² and methane. Many people - all the good ones - are concerned, and worry about adding more carbon. 13. There are numerous discussions and plans for reducing the emissions of industrial carbon in the atmosphere. No real action, you understand. Emissions go up every year, especially in the US and China, but... Talk. Chin music. It's the first step. 14. Are you one of the people who retweets pleas to save the Florida Panther, or the Keys Deer, or the Red Wolf, or the Orangutan? Cutting carbon emissions is guaranteed to not help. Weeping for the creature is guaranteed to not help. 15. Almost for sure, solar panel farms and wind power farms are guaranteed to make it worse. Whole chunks of ecosystem will be modified to suit the needs of solar panels and wind turbines, and whatever lived in the unmodified ecosystem will, by definition, not live in the new one 16. Building enough lithium batteries to power a fleet of cars and trucks to replace the current fossil fueled fleet will destroy whole new ecosystems that have so far survived petroleum extraction and refining, survived the paving over of millions of acres of once living soil. 17. Either we care about the rest of life or we don't. Either we need a certain minimum of other life to maintain an Earth that can support us or we don't. But pretending that worrying about \"global warming\" and \"carbon\" will reduce or alleviate the extinction event we have made 18. is, at the very most generous, not realistic. The day there are no more road-killed possums in Missouri will be the day there are no more possums in Missouri. And since we starved all the songbirds that used to eat the ticks, when we killed off all the bugs they also ate, 19 and the ticks are getting nature's revenge on oh-so-clever humanity, maybe we oughta keep the possums, at least. Our industrial lives are killing our only planet. And it's not \"where we live,\" it's our bodies too. Ourselves. And it's making us crazy. 20. I am asking the world to me and think the unthinkable. Park all the cars. Park all the planes. Create a society we can walk to. Prior to 200 years ago it's the only kind there had ever been. We weren't warming the globe or driving it into extinction. Now we are. --jeff out","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"1252520990"},"id_str":"1252520990","name":"Jeff McFadden","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"12426"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"7510"},"created_at":"Fri Mar 08 19:14:12 +0000 2013","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"89255"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"22"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"211"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"451"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"10"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"20"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.83975"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

What could we have done without the backing of @MAVINRECORDS and the great talents at #Caspertainment? Appreciate U Casper! The AIG said in his speech that not everyone is 100% healthy &amp; we can not say that based on that, we should End everyone’s life. In as much as this is true, we MUST appreciate that we can not treat the dead, neither can the sick approach a hospital renowned for killing patients. To intellectually understand the simplified campaign in its original construct as an idealistic movement, we must explore various studies (i.e. JonathanHaidt’s “Righteous Minds”), our moral sentiments are strongly related to feelings of empathy in the face of harm and unfairness. Thus, it is easier to mobilize against injustice than for Justice. This is typical in Nigeria. If we have started the campaign with #ReformPoliceNG nobody will take us seriously. The same way no one understood the meaning or essence of restructuring till tomorrow. It is vague. We have grown accustomed to enthusiastically fighting the bad (or perceived bad in most cases) for instance Police killings (EndSARS) instead of Police Reforms. We are more willing to fight Hunger &amp; Poverty instead of fighting for the kind of Growth &amp; Development that makes Food &amp; sustainable livelihoods plentiful. So when we focus so much about fighting the bad we lose sight of what constitute the Good &amp; how to unleash it. #WhyEndSARS Sometimes switching from the “bad” to the corresponding “good” is simply a matter of semantics: to fight against racism is to fight for nondiscrimination. So by #EndSARS we’re inadvertently demanding the effective, immediate &amp; holistic PoliceReform, while ending the impunity. So we are in no way attacking the bad to create the good but simply doing good to force the bad to change. This was why we have refused to politicize the advocacy of weaponization se it against any Govt, political party or individual. We have also shunned shenanigans &amp; propaganda Our focus was on setting a pace and creating a template that would sustainably cure other ailments in our respective institutions. The bad is often caused by the absence of the good. The good likewise refer to a Capable State, the ideal, which is not an utopian state of mind. A bureaucracy that can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activity, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all. #WhyEndSARS So we have the attention of the authorities (Executive, Legislative and Judiciary) and most importantly the Police hierarchy and the dialogue has commenced. This is the second official dialogue as it coincides with the agreement on Security Sector Reforms at Interior @abellodam https://t.co/AhFULBYDtF It is the absence of a capable state that causes corruption (the inability to prevent public officials, often in collusion with other members of society, from subverting decision-making for private gain), as well as poverty and backwardness. Some might argue that reducing corruption entails the creation of a capable state; the good is created out of the fight against the bad. But this is a fallacy. Teachers and nurses often do not show up for work, but that does not mean that performance would improve much if they did. Policemen may stop asking for bribes, but that will not make them any better at catching criminals and preventing crime. Curtailing side-payments does not imply the ability to manage concession contracts or collect taxes. Those that are in NASS believe a new Bill may be the answer but is it always about more legislation? Aside from prosecuting some bad apples, measures to fight corruption typically involve reforming procurement rules, public financial management systems, and anti-corruption legislation. The underlying assumption is that the new rules, unlike the previous rules, will be enforced. That has not been Uganda’s experience. In 2009, under pressure from the aid community, the government enacted what was billed at the time as the best anti-corruption legislation in the world; and yet all corruption indicators have continued to worsen. Uganda is not an exception, same is happening in Nigeria since 2015 change of Government, with an anti corruption themed political party. So this is just to paint a picture of the multilayered and dynamic angles through which we need to channel our energies to ensure we are not fixated in the approach to building our nation. It will require a lot of inputs from the public and not just those in the system. The next Police Recruitment will be monitored surgically. We need enlightened hands and good heads on the right shoulders forthwith. No more political recommendations and back door hires. Nigeria belongs to all of us. #WhyEndSARS #LetsKeepTalking We are now focusing our energy on #ReformPoliceNG (Doing the Good...shining our Light instead of fighting the bad. We now have the attention of each and every entity that matters. It is time to build &amp; not further tear down). @citizen_gavel https://t.co/4Cw9QmBZzQ","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14879097"},"id_str":"14879097","name":"SEGA L'éveilleur®🚨","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"177609"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"28411"},"created_at":"Fri May 23 08:03:32 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"366999"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"22"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"711"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1095"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"7"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"32"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"50"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.96259"},"all_hashtags":["InternationalYouthDay","SafeSpaces4Youth","WhyEndSARS","Caspertainment","ReformPoliceNG","EndSARS","LetsKeepTalking"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184152"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"308"},"texto":"Things I have learned about the general public whilst working at the library: 1. A huge number of people under 20 can't read face clocks, having grown up with only digital one. 2. Many people don't know how to spell \"library.\" It's in our email address. This causes problems 3. A disturbing number of young people don't actually know how book-lending at the library works. They assume it costs money! Teach your children about libraries! 4. Crime and thriller are basically the same thing in many cases. In fact, we have doubles of books because of that. 5. People use hidden codes like asterisks to mark which books they've read. Please don't do that! The system will let you know if you've already borrowed something! Just ask. 6. If an automatic door breaks, people will walk into it instead of reading the sign at face height. 7. Libraries are a godsend for blind and deaf people and not just for audiobooks. They can come for help with filling out forms and getting directions. 8. Some elderly people go through books at a TERRIFYING rate. They are to be feared and respected. 9. Some people are so afraid of computers that they will come to you with a query and then become upset if you offer to look it up on the computer instead of in a book. 10. Some people have never, ever used a telephone. Especially older women. Their husband did it for them. 11. The DWP fuck over everyone but especially the most vulnerable and I haven't met a single library worker who hasn't helped struggling library users with food or phone calls or even a cup of tea when it's cold and they can't afford heating. 12. The Jobcentre regularly lie to people and like to tell them they can get services at libraries that simply do not exist. We will try our very best to help you get what you should have been given at the Jobcentre. 13. Most banks assume that everyone has an email now. In fact, some people have trouble proving that they exist at all without one. 14. Library folk are good folk. We do this because we are passionate about it. We have to be. 15. Libraries aren't quiet anymore. They're community hubs now. They may have quiet study areas but most libraries are bustling with activity. Between kids' classes, singing and memory groups for those with Dementia, craft sessions and noisy office equipment, don't expect silence 16. Libraries remain the only place where you can spend hours in a publicly-accessible building without being expected to spend money. Parents come to entertain their children for free on wet days. People in poverty come for a warm place to sit. Libraries are a haven. 17. Some people will go their entire lives only reading 2-3 authors but still have enough material to read a book every month. (See also: Danielle Steel, James Patterson, Clive Cussler, etc.) 18. A library lives and dies by the staff on the counter. You can have the best funding, all of the books and tech in the world but you'll only get footfall if your staff go above and beyond. Sometimes even that doesn't work, though and it's frustrating. 19. We're funded based on footfall. I've seen staff cry because we lost a youth group to a private hall that has fancier facilities like a cafe. We need all the footfall we can get. 20. Staff are hitting their heads against walls volunteering to create events, classes and groups only to have them shot down because local councils don't understand social media or want to charge for it. I can't overemphasise just how much unpaid work staff do. 21. Most of the facilities are only working because staff pay out of pocket to get things working. My manager bought a new laminator when we couldn't afford one. She buys in colouring materials for kids. We sometimes bring in our own stationery. We even but lightbulbs in. 22. Authors don't like to visit little libraries because they don't get paid. Bookstores often pay. 23. The \"sexy librarian\" trope has actually done a LOT of harm and has caused countless incidences of sexual assault by men who can't tell the difference between porn and reality. 24. Old ladies keep libraries in business. Old ladies who read are the best. Old ladies who can tell you exactly which page features the most gruesome murder scene are the very best. 25. Library staff ALWAYS want to know what you thought of the book. We want to know what to recommend to others! 26. I'm not supposed to have favourite library users but I do: I love library couples, who bicker over each others' reading tastes or share books and then argue about the themes. I also love the autistic kids with special interests. I will crawl over hot coals to get you a book about the specific type of train you are interested in, tiny child. I will listen to you tell me about it in great detail. I will try to remember for the next time you come in. 27. The single best moment, for me, is when a library user graduates from Young Adult to Adult and suddenly the entire library is open to them! They can read anything! No more tiny teen section! All of the classics! Sci fi! Horror! They often get overwhelmed. 28. And finally, because I've spammed you long enough and because my typos are mounting up, remember this: Library staff can overcome many challenges but Book Gods help you if you deprive us of caffeine. You don't want to see what happens then.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"20466483"},"id_str":"20466483","name":"Secret Library Gorgon 🐍","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"13285"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"964"},"created_at":"Mon Feb 09 20:57:19 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"79908"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"22"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"46112"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"308029"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2096"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"14001"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.03485"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Anger"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}

First off, congratulations! It's a really great environment to learn and make friends! Since I've been answering the same qs for many, here's a thread of tips: I'm heading to #defcon @defcon and @DianaInitiative only this year because I'm finalizing a keynote and working on a super secret thing for Saturday. I don't have the capacity to also go to #BlackHat2018 and #BSidesLV so will sadly be missing those :( With that said though, @BSidesLV is one of my favs and I've never been to Black hat. I've been to #defcon for 10 years straight. Even missed family reunions to go! 1 What is there to do at defcon? While most of my time is dedicated to our hak5 booth in the vendor hall, there are also talks, villages, parties, contests, meetups, etc. There's a get together for anything and everything: LGBTQ, furries, women, kids, zip codes, etc. Most of these can be found via the defcon website. I highly recommend taking some time to look at the schedule of events and picking a few each day. Leave yourself time to relax and recoup from the non-stop house music, loud casino machines, people, and smoke. Personally, I like to spend my free time making new friends, meeting other women in the industry, checking out the lock picking and wifi villages and wandering. Between interviews and my shooting schedule 🤣 there's also a new @EthicsVillage this year! Tips for packing: expect a video on this in a bit on my personal channel, https://t.co/zM2ut01S5w -water -snacks -good walking shoes -deodorant/antiperspirant -lots of cash for your ticket and the vendor room -a phone charger -usb cables -sunglasses -sunscreen (eco-friendly!) -+ Hacker stuff, if legally permitted to carry across state borders and/or on a plane: -your lockpicks -ham radio (I'm bringing mine!) -portable soldering gun -multi tool -spare cables -etc You can make instant friends with someone if you're there when they're in need of a tool. Stuff you don't necessarily need to bring unless you're entering a contest, taking a class, or doing a ctf: -your laptop Seriously. I never bring mine because it takes up too much space and it weighs too much. #badgelife is a thing and can get expensive! Bring spare batteries for your shinies! https://t.co/RMHWxkyWSx Now let's talk safety and security at #defcon #BlackHat2018 #BSidesLV ! I have a background in hospitality administration. Some things the hotels / restaurants should know, but may not have been trained correctly on: -when you check into your hotel, the front desk should give you a room key and WRITE DOWN your room #. They should NOT say your room number out loud. If they do, ask them to give you a new room and not say it out loud. This is in case of eavesdropping. -do not leave valuables in your room. Bring a comfortable carry all bag to walk around the con with. You'll thank me when you buy something in the vendor hall and they don't have shopping bags.. (Hak5 does offer shopping bags this year!) -check and double check your hotel and restaurant bills. It's really easy for someone to charge something to your room or table, especially if they know your name. Much worse if they know your room #. It's also easy for a restaurant or hotel to double charge. Casinos have rules for a reason, please follow them, especially in light of the tragedy at Mandalay Bay. -masks on the casino floor are not permitted. -underage drinking is not permitted -weapoms are not permitted Etc etc. Don't give the hotel/casino reason to have bias. Personal safety: Be aware of the people around you. The only time I have been victimized at a con was in the presence of someone I thought was a good aquaintance. If you don't feel safe, report, gather evidence, do whatever you need to do to feel safe. Read the code of conduct. Awareness: when unlocking your phone, hide your pin/phrase/gesture, whatever. Always keep your phone on your person. Not just from badies at the con, but for theft as well. Have a buddy system so y'all stick together 24/7. Have a code word or something that tells your friend that you feel unsafe and wanna leave. This is the same thing women do at clubs! And ladies, if you're in an awkward situation and want to leave without being harassed or followed, I'll gladly be your bff that just happened to be there at the right moment and omg we need to catch up right now because I have something important to tell you. Never accept open beverages. It's not rude. It's mandatory. Be aware of your surroundings when heading back to your room at the end of the night. Use that buddy system. Here's a recent post from @thedarktangent re the code of conduct: https://t.co/xkJoJ4LDnK Remember, cons are what you make of them. If you go in positively, positivity comes back to you. I truly believe this! I have been going to defcon for 10 years for a reason. I've met friends who I later invited to my wedding. I've learned more than I could imagine. I ❤️ it.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14203895"},"id_str":"14203895","name":"Shannon Morse","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"52134"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"800"},"created_at":"Sun Mar 23 22:09:11 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"41432"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"22"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"79"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"529"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"4"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"24"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.20839"},"all_hashtags":["defcon","BlackHat2018","BSidesLV","badgelife"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"4"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184154"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"310"},"texto":"THREAD: What does today's news that Manafort's attorneys briefed Trump's attorneys about what he told Mueller after he agreed to cooperate tell us? 1/ Today @nytimes reported that Manafort's lawyer repeatedly briefed Trump's lawyers about Manafort's discussions with Mueller *after* Manafort had already begun to cooperate. This arrangement is extremely unusual and highly questionable. https://t.co/tA5ohrGTtI 2/ Before a defendant pleads guilty, his interests typically align with other people who are under investigation. In this investigation, before Manafort pleaded guilty, his interests were roughly aligned with Trump's because both of them are under investigation. 3/ Once Manafort pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, his interests shifted. Typically cooperators / flippers are viewed as part of the prosecution team. They are trying to help the prosecution by providing information and potential testimony. 4/ It is common for attorneys representing subjects of an investigation to enter into what is called a \"joint defense agreement.\" That is a way that lawyers for different people under investigation agree to exchange information and keep that information privileged. 5/ That agreement works because of something called the \"common interest\" doctrine, which says that when two people have a common interest in a legal matter, they can exchange information about that matter and keep it privileged. 6/ Those agreements are routine in complex white collar criminal cases, and I often enter into those agreements with other attorneys when I represent people under investigation. (And when I was a federal prosecutor, white collar defense attorneys usually had those agreements.) 7/ A common provision of those agreements, whether they're written or not, is that the person is required to notify everyone else that is part of the agreement if their client agrees to cooperate with the government, because that ends the common interest. 8/ Once someone flips, as Manafort did, his interests are against everyone else under investigation because the prosecutors will require him to cooperate against everyone else and tell them everything he knows. So communications from other subjects to him aren't privileged. 9/ In this case, after Manafort flipped, Mueller's team rightfully believed that their conversations with him wouldn't be shared with other people under investigation. Manafort's decision to do so was highly deceptive and undermined Mueller's investigation. 10/ By reporting to Trump what Mueller was asking about, Manafort was hurting Mueller, not helping him--even though he agreed to assist Mueller under the agreement. By any standard, what Manafort and his attorney did was deceptive and highly improper. 11/ Earlier today during our recording of the #OnTopic podcast, @JoyceWhiteVance said she would view communications with Trump's team as a breach of the agreement. (The episode will be out tomorrow--Wednesday.) I agree. But as I told her, I would go further if I was Mueller. 12/ Because Manafort had agreed to cooperate with Mueller, his attorney's communications with Trump's team were no longer privileged because they do not share a common interest. Mueller should seek to discover the communications between Manafort's attorney and Trump's attorneys. 13/ That would be very tricky to do, because those attorneys would resist, and putting them in this situation could disqualify them from representing their clients because they may have disclosed client confidences, which means their clients might have a claim against them. 14/ The mere threat of taking this action would usually dissuade any lawyer from continuing to engage in this activity. But it's already happened. So what can be done now? While the attorneys did something highly unusual and likely unethical, it's generally not a crime. 15/ On its own, this could just be considered highly questionable judgment. But if this is part of a pattern of activity, you could imagine this being part of a larger obstruction of justice case being made by Mueller. It is another active attempt to undermine his investigation. 16/ I have participated in many investigations, both when I was a federal prosecutor and now as a defense attorney, and I've never heard of something like this happening. If true, Trump's attorneys are willing to take huge risks because they think they can get away with it. 17/ Some of you are asking, in responses to this thread, how they can get away with doing this. For one thing, it's very possible that none of them wrote down the conversations they had with each other, and all of them would resist efforts to discover what they told each other. 18/ If Mueller pursued them, it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt exactly what they said. Trump and his allies could bring political pressure and call Mueller's tactics aggressive, which they would be--they would be a response to highly aggressive tactics. 19/ Trump could always pardon his attorneys, although that could come at a political cost. So what comes of this? Mueller's team could detail all of this to the judge who will sentence Manafort. She is obligated to consider the \"history and characteristics\" of Manafort. 20/ She is also obligated to consider the \"nature and circumstances\" of his offense. Mueller could also try to find out what the attorneys told each other--merely trying to do that would have consequences. He could also include this activity as part of this obstruction case. 21/ Given DOJ guidance that a sitting president can't be indicted, any conclusion that Trump obstructed justice would likely not take the form of an indictment. But the efforts to obstruct the investigation via Manafort could be part of Mueller's conclusion on the topic. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"759481842814726144"},"id_str":"759481842814726144","name":"Renato Mariotti","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"203570"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1014"},"created_at":"Sat Jul 30 20:12:36 +0000 2016","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"24216"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"22"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"9981"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"40761"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"454"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1853"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.32504"},"all_hashtags":["OnTopic"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Disgust","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

A Key Swing State Voter Registration Files DHS and The States Say They Weren’t Touched By Russia! Then Who Touched Them. Pennsylvania Voter Registration Files Our Study The Most Important Finding We Have Made! This is the largest data analysis we have ever done. We took Six Complete Pennsylvania Voter Registration Files and Compared them over more than a One Year Period!! Each Data Set has over 8.5 Million Registered Voters. Each Voter’s record contains 153 data fields. That’s over 50 Million records, and nearly 8 BILLION pieces of data. To compare any Two Time Frames we had to be able to Crunch 17 Million Records!! In order to do this we had to Rent High Speed Online Computers. We worked on this data virtually non stop for three months!! Rather than importing this data into a database and running simple statistical queries, we uploaded it onto a high speed cloud computer and wrote scripts. Dozens of scripts. At first we didn't know what to look for. So we just probed the data. We counted the voters in each county, for each data set, by party. Then we started noticing odd things. Duplicate records. Voter records changing in ways that didn't make any sense at all. We wrote more scripts, based on what we found. Looking for duplicate and anomalous data within each data set. Looking for changes in voter data between data sets. We wrote dozens of scripts. Pulled out over a million lines of data for closer examination. The more we looked the less it made sense. This entailed months of work - writing scripts then rewriting them so they would run more efficiently. Moving data up to the cloud and downloading results. Examining the data and talking about what it all means and what to look at next. We are still running additional queries. This Report Highlights Our Findings To Date. A Database is an organized collection of data. A Database does not have a mind of its own. A Database merely displays the information within it. What we are about to Disclose are Changes to the Pennsylvania Registration Database That Makes No Sense. These Changes were not done by the Database. These Changes Were Done Through Changes to Data that were then inserted into the Database!! In our previous thread we discussed the laws pertaining to this data. No voter's data record can be changed without that voter knowing. In most cases the voter must make the change. If a change is made by the state, a voter MUST be notified. Over and over we found changes that voters were completely unaware of. From Stories of 39 States Voter Registration Databases being Targeted By Russia to the more recent stories that it was 21 States Both DHS and the States Have Told US Repeatedly That The Voter Registration Files Weren’t Touched. They Were Safe. We Don’t Believe That This is True! We Don’t Think You Will Either After Reading This. Why Are They Feeding Us This Dialogue? Who Manipulated This Data? How Did They Manipulate This Data? How Did This Affect the Election? Let's take a closer look at what happened. Get Ready to Jump Down the Rabbit Hole!

Once upon a time HRC was running for President and we are all unimaginably naive. @Comey got a funny feeling and opened tightly compartmentalized criminal and counterintelligence investigations on The Big Bad Donald. Put on your rose colored glasses for this story, because it's hopelessly optimistic and sappy and you may feel a little like crying. So a little bird like @NSAGov or @GCHQ or @ACICgovau perched on Old Man Comey's shoulder and said \"Trump's a Traitor\" and Comey said hmmm.... And he did what the very best lawmen do. He gathered the toughest, smartest, most secretest, experienced old investigators and prosecutors and he said \"Find everything. Leak Nothing. And tell me if there's a traitor. And DO IT BY THE BOOK\" I will make sure you are protected. And through the insane summer of 2016; Wikileaks hurricanes of the Fall; the WTF shitstorm of stupid Weiner's dickpics cum laptopappalooza. Through Facebook suxing Putin's dix; through the AG having a secret meeting with B Clinton on the tarmac, COMEY PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION And come October, 2016, COMEY F'N TOLD TRUMP, OBAMA AND THE GANG OF EIGHT - Russians are trying to throw the election, and Trump's camp is working with them. AND MUTHRFXN McConnell said tufshit. And Trump said (sdasrkeu0?). And COMEY PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION And us little piggies watched in ABJECT HORROR the night of the election as Florida and Pennsylvania went the wrong way and Evil Trump was elected. And the McConnel/Gorsuch abortion worked. And Paul \"Sellout\" Ryan was 3rd in line to POTUS. AND COMEY PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION. And Drumpf called Comey to the White House and demanded loyalty. And Comey promised loyalty to the law. AND WROTE IT ALL DOWN. AND PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION. And Stupid Drumpf fires Sally Yates for warning the White House that \"General\" Flynn was a fxn Russian Spy. And Jeff Sessions is asked by Senators Franken (we miss him!) and Leahy if he had any contact with the Russians and HE LIES LIKE THE TOADY POS HE IS, and is then confirmed Curtains close. Something happens. We can't see. What is it @TrueFactsStated @lauferlaw @ManchuCandidate @marykerry @SaysDana @ChiefCovfefe @LouiseMensch @MaddogSpicy @PNC16basses @ThomasS4217 ? SESSIONS RECUSES FROM RU PROBE, COMEY HAS PROTECTED IT. HOW? Curtains still closed... Trump demands Comey's firing; Rosenstein says \"Whatev, I'll write 10 memos, IT'LL MAKE ME DEPUTY AG IN CHARGE OF RU PROBE.\" Comey fired AHAHAHAHA Introducing Robert Mueller, Special Counsel. Curtains open. @marykerry @t_pletch @LuluLemew Intermission: If you don't follow me, you can't read the rest of the story, so you should. You should follow my band, too, @dirkandthetruth . Cuz they WILL perp walk DumJr. So here we are. Comey was fired by Trump. Who laughed with the filthy russians in OUR WHITE HOUSE. F them all. https://t.co/QWqZLzPrXN And Rosenstein was put in charge of the Trump Russia probe. And he appointed Special Counsel Mueller. THE ABSOLUTE LAST PERSON TRUMP WOULD WANT IN THAT JOB. https://t.co/7Tv8f58Ph5. Mueller KNOWS WHO TRUMP IS ALREADY. AND MEGOLIVECH. AND COMEY HAS PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION THE WHOLE WAY. AND MUELLER IS IN CHARGE NOW. AND THIS MAY BE THE BIGGEST TROLL OVER TROLLED ON ANYONE AND TRUMP IS THE DUMBEST CRIMINAL ALIVE. And my god us little piggies suffer terribly under disinformation, and despair porn, and a WH full of lies and traitors, and we try to see the light and stay on the path but its hard and the night is full of terror. BUT COMEY AND ROD ROSENSTEIN HAVE PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION And as an aside HOLY SHIZZLE I GOT RETWEETED BY THE @TheRickWilson. See @matt9875 it's all worth it now. https://t.co/Ymc75PCGWB Dammit @Maddog_Spicy I miss tagged you. What up @maddogpac skipped you too. Stupid twitter broke my thread, so apologies if the next few look like repeats: And so, kids, it's the FIRST DAY OF SPRING, and SC Mueller has put it all down on paper, put a bow on it, and put it on Mr. Barr's desk. AND BARR WRITES A LETTER TO CONGRESS AND SAYS \"IM FOLLOWING THE LAW AND STUFF\" And COMEY, RR, SCM AND BARR PROTECTED THE INVESTIGATION And OMG, Barr says to Congress, I'll give you the executive summary THIS WEEKEND, and I'll release the letter to the public, and I AGREE WITH ROBERT \"IRON TRIANGLE\" MUELLER'S RECOMMENDATIONS, and ITS ABOUT TO GET REAL HOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. And us little piggies can ignore the despair porn and the confused/bought off press and KNOW that great lawmen (and women) have done everything to PROTECT AND COMPLETE the investigation. And we can all live happily ever after in a land where the RULE OF LAW is the only king. Sleep tight. Next week is going to be fantastic.

This shows she is a high-value asset for Tehran &amp; holds many secrets. https://t.co/4mXYbl4meu 2) \"... Marzieh Hashemi, born Melanie Franklin of New Orleans, was arrested after arriving at St. Louis Lambert Int'l Airport on Sunday. The broadcaster, citing her family, said Hashemi was taken into FBI custody and brought to the Washington area.\" https://t.co/9LIMmNPXWQ 3) \"U.S. Federal law allows the government to arrest and detain a witness if it can prove that their testimony is material to a criminal proceeding and that it cannot guarantee their presence through a subpoena.\" https://t.co/D0MTkWzRBB 4) \"At the request of the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued the order, the first official U.S. confirmation of reports of the arrest of Marzieh Hashemi, an anchor for Iran’s English-language Press TV satellite channel.\" https://t.co/bsomejPU1E 5) “For me, embracing Islam is directly in relation to Islamic revolution of Iran and the characteristic of Imam Khomeini,” Hashemi told ESTEBSAR, an Iranian English state-run website on February 14, 2015. https://t.co/0F1Hqh4Jgw 6) “As a fanatic supporter of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, she defended his presidency and justified his regime’s crackdown on the Iranian people who took to the streets in 2009 to protest against rigged elections results.” https://t.co/vZbpQDoqgf 7) This is Hashemi being ridiculous: “I witnessed demonstrations that were demanding security forces to actually crack down. They were saying give us, you know, we want security,” Hashemi told National Public Radio on July 4, 2009. https://t.co/KSESvMhA8n 8) According to the Fars news agency, run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hashemi received numerous promotions in the regime’s state-run media after producing her so-called documentary against the 2009 uprising in Iran. https://t.co/ABAgvAOAeC 9) After first denying the murder of #Iran’s 2009 uprising icon Neda Agha Soltan, the regime went on to blame the CIA, a foreign country &amp; even the protesters themselves. Finally, Hashemi claimed the opposition PMOI/MEK murdered her. Soltan was shot &amp; killed by the IRGC Basji. https://t.co/lEsF2a5KK3 10) When the #Iran lobby group @NIACouncil follows up on Hashemi’s arrest, there is no longer any doubt she is an operative of Tehran's mullahs. https://t.co/ExdxAsW4pq 11) Iranians have launched a hashtag expressing their feelings about NIAC: #Shut_Up_NIAC https://t.co/vUh0gb6AXR 12) Former Iranian intelligence chief Ali Fallahian explains how #Iran's regime dispatches so-called reporters &amp; journalists abroad to gather information for the regime's Ministry of Intelligence &amp; Security (MOIS). Hashemi is a perfect example. https://t.co/Iexa6aSuiB 13) In 2012, the EU imposed sanctions against the head of #Iran’s state-broadcasting network (IRIB) for playing a “key role in serious human rights violations.” As a result, the leading satellite platform Eutelsat removed Press TV from its satellite. https://t.co/hTsqtTgZxe 14) In 2003, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned IRIB and its then-director Ezatollah Zarghami for trampling dissents. The result was taking Press TV off the air in North America from the Galaxy 19 satellite broadcaster. https://t.co/hX2o9nz69u 15) Spain also banned Press TV’s Spanish channel Hispan and ordered it to be taken off air from the Hotbird satellite. https://t.co/mGiokt73Jj 16) In September 2010, India banned Press TV for intentional measures in provoking ethnic tensions. A report aired by Press TV inflamed Muslim anger. 17) “Indian forces killed 14 protesters and wounded scores of others Monday in confrontations across Kashmir fueled in part by a report that a Quran (Koran) was desecrated in the United States.” https://t.co/qvuHhQhabi 18) “[The protesters in Kashmir] were inflamed by reports on the Iranian state-run channel Press TV that the Quran was desecrated over the weekend in the United States.” 19) The UK government-approved Office of Communications, Ofcom, also removed Press TV from Sky in January 2012 &amp; slapped a £100,000 fine against it. https://t.co/2MVFZdJPeG 20) “Ofcom said the state broadcaster's English language outlet had breached several broadcasting license rules over editorial control of the channel.” https://t.co/7eaP8i3eR6 21) The fine came after the network broadcast an interview with an imprisoned journalist, which Ofcom said had been conducted under duress. 22) Conclusion? Yours to make. I believe Marzieh Hashemi is a high-value asset for #Iran’s regime &amp; the mullahs are terrified she will reveal unwanted secrets that will be damning for Tehran. https://t.co/DXu14nwie7","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2554131522"},"id_str":"2554131522","name":"Heshmat Alavi","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"34907"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"241"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 08 07:41:33 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"52003"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"22"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"863"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1181"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"2"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"39"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"54"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.34255"},"all_hashtags":["Iran","Shut_Up_NIAC"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

The “Dossier” Fusion GPS is a commercial research/strategic intelligence firm based in D.C. co-founded in 2011 by Glenn Simpson, former reporter for Roll Call and Wall Street Journal. The dossier is the geometric center for the circle of filth. 2. Isn't it most peculiar that deputy AG Rod Rosenstein refused to answer if the FBI paid for the dossier? “I believe I know the answer, but the Intelligence Committee is the appropriate committee…” https://t.co/LrWlzAgG9r 3. If you don't know what I am talking about and would like to, carve out time to explore the complexities of this winding maze of depravity and treason. Be forewarned, its not for the mentally languid. https://t.co/YPvW8fggdl 4. Fusion GPS has been active in American politics from it very inception: Back in 2102 Dems hired Fusion for “opposition research” against Mitt Romney. Mother Jones published an article against one of his PAC contributors, Frank VanderSloot. https://t.co/F1EPZtjiAZ 5. You know I kept scratching my head: where else had I heard about Mother Jones and Fusion GPS? It tore me up. Aha! I remembered: Christoper Steele who would be hired by Fusion GPS many years later to publish Trump-Russia Dossier passed his findings to Mother Jones October 2016 6. You really think that it is mere coincidence that Fusion GPS and Mother Jones’ paths seem to fortuitously cross at the “right moment” ? This association bugged me till I went back to all my previous tweets. Here it is: https://t.co/nVytEfGSGr 7. 17 Democrats on House Judiciary Committee sent a letter, July 2017 to Justice Department demanding answers as to why agency dismissed money laundering case earlier involving Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya who met with Donald Trump Jr during last year's campaign 8. Almost everybody heard about this instance. The Department agreed to settle this $230 million case for less than $6 million and no admission of wrongdoing. https://t.co/3OuRR8O7Zu 9. Digging a little further: the company at the heart of this issue, Prevezon, whose sole shareholder was Russian Denis Katsyv, whose father is Petr Katsyv, vice president of Russia's state-run rail monopoly. 10. Turns out Katsyv’s lawyer was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was not licensed to practice in the US. So, Katsyv hired the law firm of BakerHostetler to represent Prevezon; BakerHostetler hired FUSION GPS in 2014 to provide research help for the litigation….. 11. Yes, its not a typo, a Russian hired Fusion GPS.....Do you think that it is a mere coincidence that the lawyer of the company that hired Fusion GPS in 2014 ended up meeting with Donald Trump Jr during the 2016 campaign? https://t.co/lwF8S7jgzh 12. On July 27, 2017, Fusion GPS accused White House of trying to \"smear\" it for investigating the president's alleged ties to Russia. This is not a banal statement, but strategy, call out the people you are smearing as being ones who are persecuting you. https://t.co/8wUexvz0r6 13. I know because they did it again, today, Dec 13, 2017. Fusion’s lawyer admitted they hired Nellie Ohr, but complained .... 14. “Now, I don’t have proof as to how Fox News got that information or how Washington Examiner got the information from the bank, but I’m pretty confident that they didn't get it from Fusion” https://t.co/h1Gi2Yep7G 15. Isn't it priceless, Fusion GPS is the metastatic cancer that is slowly destroying the country from within, spreading lies, falsehoods and systematic disinformation, but somehow they argue that they are the victims here. Where else do we see “victimhood politics”? 16. If you hold the Dossier/Fusion GPS as the focal point of your attention, I suspect you will be way ahead of the average individual, a lot of things will reveal themselves very clearly in the near future. https://t.co/NiLgVhYMst 17. McCabe, Strzok, Ohr, Page are all now becoming key individuals curiously connected with the Dossier. Where does Comey fit it? https://t.co/XxxyzQhLjR 18. Bruce Ohr’s Wife, Nellie Ohr was paid by Fusion GPS all through summer of 2016, Bruce was also in contact with Christopher Steele.https://t.co/Xk9XyaESv7 19. Then Today we learned that Nellie Ohr registered a Ham radio a month after DNC/Hillary retained Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump. Why does a middle aged woman suddenly need to register a HAM radio? Unless that helps her communicate undetected? 20. The Dossier and Fusion GPS are inextricably connected to the concerted plan to influence American politics and to try to prevent Trump’s presidency. https://t.co/0iAaIw5rOV 21. Shifty Adam Schiff, an unctuous peddler of lies is still pushing the Trump Russia connection, why does he look increasing sweaty though? Why has the whole Imran Awan-Debbie Wasserman case gone silent? 22. Do you really think that all of what has been going on over the last few years went on without the knowledge of then president Obama and his intelligence people? 23.

This thread sheds light. https://t.co/kCqTqZLIyh 4) This is one example from Mashhad, NE #Iran. While the regime broadcasts old footage of rallies &amp; blurs the trees, this is the real, on-the-ground footage of this city's \"massive, million man march\" marking the 40th anniversary of the 1979 revolution. https://t.co/WT0ewsun59 5) And another ridiculous example from #Iran Authorities bring a \"Bugs Bunny\" character to the rally marking the 40th anniversary of the 1979 revolution.

However, he goes the distance to justify the regime’s efforts against “terror attacks.” https://t.co/QaTSYTDeCm 17) #Iran’s regime has a history of staging “terror attacks” to justify future crackdown. “How Iran signals future waves of crackdown, terror attacks” https://t.co/i1LP3bbyDU https://t.co/w9g0X2fZXn 18) Here’s another example: “How Iran's Mullahs Welcome The ISIS Attack” https://t.co/3kifauMABi https://t.co/e4Dvw5nhLh 19) @ThomasErdbrink claims of “progress made since the revolution,” yet he never mentions of the atrocities brought upon #Iran, the Middle East and beyond because of the mullahs’ regime. https://t.co/y4qMqxTpsK 20) “Look at the inequality in America, look at the Yellow Vests in France, across the world everybody is unhappy.

Just this week @BBCTwo get told by an Arab the Jews are the target &amp; #BBC covers it up. Elsewhere @RashidaTlaib distorts history. All to hide the real cause of the conflict - Arab violence against Jews. During the Second Intifada - media &amp; politicians were adamant total desperation was the reason Arab terrorists killed Jews in suicide attacks. Yet the 2 bombers at Mike's Place were British , how were they more desperate that you or I? Let us look closer at these excuses- https://t.co/BRVdr1Pbzd 2019 &amp; Israeli civilians are murdered as 100s of rockets are fired at Israel. This as violent riots on Gaza's border are painted as peaceful by the media. The excuse? Gaza is a pressure cooker. Logically, if you remove the pressure the killing stops. So let's check that shall we? https://t.co/4TEjd4qH9w It is February 7 2019. Ori Ansbacher is raped &amp; murdered. Full details of the brutal killing are withheld. The terrorist explicitly said he entered Israel with a knife to kill a Jew. The BBC didn't make up excuses - or mistranslate - they didn't even bother to report it. https://t.co/gNbOW8iJKm In October 2015 - the 'knife intifada' was in full swing. We were told then that the reason Arabs were murdering innocent Jews was because the ‘status quo’ on the Temple Mount was being threatened. If that is true - then let us step back a year. https://t.co/6zwGVcuSc2 It is 2014. The status quo on the Temple Mount is not being threatened. There's an attack by a 16-year-old terrorist who stabs Jews at a supermarket in Mishor Adumim. Western media say it was because of frustration from the Gaza conflict. If this is true, let us go further back. https://t.co/qNNVx7tudr March 2004. There's no seige on Gaza. No pressure cooker. 2 Gaza terrorists kill 10 Israelis in Ashdod. The reason? Gaza is occupied. So Israel withdrew from Gaza, dismantled settlements &amp; what happened? They received Hamas rockets in return - but anyway, let us look further back https://t.co/uMzgGGRYZJ Oct 2000, Gaza conflicts are a decade away. Vadim Nurzhitz &amp; Yossi Avrahami ‘had their eyes gouged out &amp; were disembowelled’ by an Arab lynch mob. The given excuse for the violence of the second Intifada was Ariel Sharon's foot on Temple Mount. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/6d1bskaFtM Sept 1999. Ariel Sharon's foot has not yet gone to Temple Mount. Sharon Steinmetz &amp; Yehiel Finfeter were stabbed. The Arab said he murdered them 'because they were Jews', the media had none of it. They blamed the stagnation of the peace process. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/Cyt04c6Pw4 It's late 1993 and the stagnation of the peace process is yet to be seen. 'Hope' is now the keyword. Yigal Vaknin was stabbed to death in an orchard. Hamas took responsibility. Media and politicians said they just did it to stop the peace process. If true, let us go further back. https://t.co/SSLin2NaOf March 1989. The Oslo Peace Process has not begun. An Arab worker in Tel Aviv stabs Israeli civilians on the Jewish holiday of Purim. Western press blame frustration at the occupation &amp; settlements for the violence of the first Intifada. If that is the case let us go further back. https://t.co/HuFBspOhq6 It is March 9, 1978. A decade before the intifada. Terrorists hijack a bus carrying families on an outing. 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children, were killed. The excuse? Terrorists killed the Jews to stop peace talks with Egypt. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/8JWbKVnyiZ It is 1966. There is no 'occupation' and no settlements. The Arabs massacre Jews on trains, buses &amp; attack Jewish farmers. Western media placed the blame for the violence on frustration at the refugees created during the War of 1948. If that is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/imYr8yIhrm December 2nd 1947. There are no refugees, no occupation. Israel doesn't exist. It is 3 days after @UN voted for Partition. Arabs riot in Jerusalem. 8 Jews are killed. Western media says this is just an Arab reaction to partition. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/lEecmimTdC Nov 1941. No refugees, occupation, Israel or partition. Arab leader Haj Amin al-Husseini meets Hitler. He helped form Muslim Waffen SS units and prevent 10000s of Jews escaping. Western media don't make excuses for this, they just ignore it. Which means we must look further back https://t.co/E88IfMOoqx It is April 1936. The start of the Arab revolt. By the end of the first week, 17 Jews were murdered. Media place the blame for the violence on opposition to Jewish immigration that was caused by Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. If this is the case, let us go further back. https://t.co/aFghguVVUJ August 1929. There is no partition, no Israel &amp; no refugees. Abraham Mizrachi is stabbed to death - within days- there are massacres of Jews in Jerusalem Hebron &amp; Tzfat. The excuse? The threat Arabs felt a Jewish presence brought. If this is the case, let us go even further back https://t.co/zT3MoLWebS It is 1920. There is no partition, no Israel, no refugees &amp;,little immigration. The Neba Musa festival. Jerusalem Riots had Arabs murdering Jews again. This time the excuse was disappointment at the non-fulfilment of independence. If this is the case, let's go even further back. https://t.co/BhKMPBXv4h 1910. We have left British Palestine, because it does not yet exist. There's no promise of independence, no Balfour &amp; no Mandate. Ariel Sharon's foot has not yet been born. We are in Shiraz for a massacre of Jews. The excuse? A blood libel. Let us look further back https://t.co/DTSv7wtQyc We travel before the modern Zionist movement began. To the Ottoman Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. The British are flooded with request from Jews to protect them. There are pogroms in Jerusalem in 1870 &amp; 1895 and in Jaffa in 1876. The excuse long forgotten. Let us look further back. https://t.co/EWGqBcoJXz It is 1834. Six years before the murder of innocent Jews in the Damascus blood libel. A pogrom occurs in Tzfat. Jews are killed and raped and homes and synagogues are destroyed. Other pogroms take place in the ME. In places like Aleppo, Beirut, Cairo, Mansura &amp; Alexandria https://t.co/DLidTkrJ8Z Before partition, before Israel, before settlements, before refugees, before Sharon, before the ‘wall’, before Hamas, before Balfour &amp; before Zionism. In the beginning there was an Arab with a knife and he murdered a Jew simply because he was a Jew.

Today's fiasco at the extremist Federal Court of Appeal shows how cultural Marxism has invaded the highest courts in Canada. It's not justice anymore; it's politics. Let me ask some very simple questions. Here's the full ruling: https://t.co/edxZMIRm7v 2. As you can see, several of the plaintiffs claim to represent \"all members\" of their Indian band. Do you think they actually canvassed \"all members\" of their bands? Or any of them? It's racist to assume all members of an Indian band agree with the chief and oppose oilsands. https://t.co/e6NSvK93Vx 3. There are 600 Indian bands in Canada. Most are tiny, like the Coldwater Band. They have 344 people on reserve, far from Vancouver. That's 70 families. I'm sure they're nice people. But it's undemocratic to give them a national veto as happened today. https://t.co/QZ6OGmPIYc https://t.co/p4bhkHgVpT 4. Look who else is suing. The Raincoast Conservation Foundation &amp; the Living Oceans Society. Both issue @CanRevAgency charitable tax receipts. Political activity is illegal under the Income Tax Act, but @gmbutts and @JustinTrudeau suspended all CRA audits for eco extremists. 5. But they're not just charities conducting illegal politics. They're foreign agents, too. For example, both cash cheques from the San Francisco-based anti-oilsands extremist foundation called the Tides Foundation: https://t.co/t5t037mCwB 6. On that same list you'll find World Wildlife Fund, where @gmbutts was prez; Sierra Club, where Zoe Caron, chief of staff to @SohiAmarjeet was prez; and Pembina, where @MarloRaynolds, chief of staff to @cathmckenna was prez. Trudeau's whole team was on the same foreign payroll. 7. So Justin Trudeau's own principal secretary, and the chiefs of staff to the energy and environment ministers, were all on the payroll of the same US anti-oil lobby group that just sunk the Trans Mountain pipeline. This is a great victory that they have worked for, for years. 8. Here's Gerald Butts, Trudeau's chaperone, mentor and strategist, a few years back saying he is against all oil pipelines. Not because of any particular route. He just opposes oil pipelines, and the entire oil economy: https://t.co/DNrYPOes7C 9. It wasn't just the Tides Foundation. Dozens of U.S. and European foundations poured money into Canada to attack our oilsands and pipelines. Here's the 2008 campaign plan by the New York-based @RockBrosFund. Look at their Canadian front groups: https://t.co/Sq2GDO4Hbm https://t.co/HoghCciceT 10. Leaf through that document, verified by @Pembina as authentic. Gerald Butts, Marlo Raynolds, Zoe Caron -- Trudeau's senior staff -- were on the @RockBrosFund payroll with the mission of destroying Canadian oil. Do you think they stopped their crusade when they came to power? 11. When I ran https://t.co/rnRunfG26N, we filed complaints with @CanRevAgency about this illegal conduct -- breaking the Income Tax Act. All of Trudeau's crooked allies were audited, and several were on the verge of losing their tax status: https://t.co/d1G76jvR4a 12. It was patently obvious Trudeau's friends were cheating the system. Read one of our meticulously researched complaints for yourself here: https://t.co/BtMV5uKMUB 13. When Trudeau took over, he installed people from these law-breaking organizations into his highest offices. Then he ordered the professional, civil servants, the non-partisan auditors at @CanRevAgency, to stop enforcing the law against his friends: https://t.co/WUowPgTn7j 14. Are you shocked that I would use words like \"cheat\" and \"corrupt\"? Don't be. Trudeau is the first sitting prime minister to be convicted of breaking the law. He illegally took a free, $100,000+ gift, and then tried to cover it up. https://t.co/lIKWbuees2 15. I forgot to point out perhaps the nuttiest part of the ruling: block the pipeline, because there are some killer whales in the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. See paragraph 68: https://t.co/edxZMIRm7v https://t.co/rY1NDlAxym 16. According to the Port of Vancouver, 3,160 ships come and go each year, an that's climbing steadily. They're not a problem, apparently. But ONE MORE SHIP PER DAY -- which is what the pipeline would add -- is an ecological crisis. Port stats: https://t.co/wyXgNNZuff 17. Why are thousands of leaky, rusty Chinese ships carrying their imports to Vancouver considered whale friendly; but state of the art, double-hulled tankers are not? Well, because Trudeau's lobbyists don't care about Chinese ships or OPEC oil -- they only lobby against Canada. 18. But look at that wording again: the pipeline is being blocked because of the threat to \"Aboriginal culture uses\" of killer whales. What does that mean? What is a \"cultural use\" of a killer whale, that only Aboriginal people can do? They can't hunt them. It's made up. https://t.co/DL9sosgvhe 19. So these three extremist judges say 3,160 Chinese freighters are fine, but one Canadian oil tanker a day is a threat; they say Aboriginals, including those hundreds of miles inland, have special \"cultural uses\" for whales. They're very concerned. But what about B.C.'s sewage? 20. Like the super-gross city of Montreal, Victoria dumps its raw sewage into the ocean. Where those precious killer whales are. Every day, Victoria treats the sea like a garbage dump. But that's OK, you see. That doesn't interfere with \"cultural use\": https://t.co/u5dxGTsow1 21. Last point: well over $100,000,000 has flooded in to Canadian politics from foreign anti-oil lobbyists, including into the 2015 election, through \"third party\" campaign groups. Some even registered with @ElectionsCan_E with their US mailing addresses! https://t.co/E9oPOzfpTj 22. Most of it has gone to the NGOs that @gmbutts coordinated. And: total silence from the Media Party. Not one word. Compare that to the freak-out that CBC had when the NRA merely looked at Canada -- didn't spend a dime, just looked: https://t.co/927FjfUvK0 23. Whenever Harper or a Conservative would meet a Republican, it was front page news, \"US-style politics!\" Whenever Trudeau or Butts would meet a Democrat -- or even have senior Democrats running and funding their campaign -- it was just called impressive and worldly by the CBC.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"20878297"},"id_str":"20878297","name":"Ezra Levant 🍁","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"175943"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1475"},"created_at":"Sat Feb 14 23:17:06 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"122025"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"23"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3661"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5356"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"159"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"233"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.25816"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

He is a CIA whistleblower who created \"The Hammer\"(HAMR). There has been much reporting, mainstream and otherwise, about Dennis. I have also covered his story in detail on my channel for the past several years. He first went public via a real estate tycoon named Tim Blixeth. The conversation that he had with Sheriff Joe Arpaio was recorded and then originally released through soundcloud by \"The American Report\". Link to their uploads: https://t.co/D6KN29HuQr Please listen to the audio above and also please listen to these videos that I have done on Dennis Montgomery: https://t.co/PH7AcfU6xM and https://t.co/NuR2GG5jlq Montgomery tells a story of completely rogue intelligence agencies spying on every American under the guise of security. Montgomery says he was instructed directly by Brennan and Clapper to penetrate and spy on private corporations and American citizens (cont) (cont) even replacing voter information in Florida. It was also revealed via Montgomery that President Trump (along with MANY others) were being illegally spied upon as far back as 2012 and earlier. There has been MUCH written about him, both positive and negative (cont) (cont) in the years since he has come forward. Dennis Montgomery filed DOZENS of whistleblower complaints over the years, and NONE of them were acknowledged. He says he just wanted to get the information about the illegality out so that something could be done about it. He was ignored by Obama. Many have attacked his credibility and written hit pieces on him. You can find the NY Times doing that here: https://t.co/5kZBNqghG7 I will leave it up to you to do some more due diligence on Mr. Montgomery and come to your own conclusions. What can not be ignored is that he was, in fact, in the positions he claimed he was in. And this was more clear when in December of 2015 he met with the FBI under an immunity agreement, and handed over all of the information he had that proved his claims to the FBI and Jim Comey He met specifically with James Baker, and he was actually questioned about this when Baker went in front of the House committee. Please see Meadows questions: (bulk of information of page 100) )https://t.co/FofZt8getr https://t.co/xzf9xRy0KY Motgomery has alleged publicly, via his former attorney Larry Klayman, that the CIA and Brennan and Clapper were electronically spying on Supreme Court judges, and even FISA court judges and members of congress. This shouldn't come as a surprise to you, as this has been admitted. https://t.co/eHqYjfSL7g So, after all of this, imagine my surprise when several months ago I received an email from Dennis Montgomery, who I had been covering for years. I made the rules very clear- do not send me ANY information that is classified or holds any classification whatsoever, He has been sending me links to articles, and some stories of some of the things he was tasked with doing while a contractor with the CIA. Sarah Carter and John Solomon briefly covered his story and then it sort of just fizzled away. They appeared on Hannity to talk about it https://t.co/3v2RncLRX6 As an open source journalist, I don't work with sources. When I get correspondence, I usually respectfully decline, and forward the source along to other reporters I trust. I did that with Dennis, but he continued to email me. I kept reading. Tonight, he sent me a story that I really wanted to share with everyone. I am just going to throw it up here. I can not confirm it with open source data, and he did not share any hard proof with me. I want to be open and transparent about that. I can only say this- the Obama administration CERTAINLY was not scandal free. And for all of the outrage the media directs at President Trump for calling the Fake News the enemy of the people? What I am about to share with you was directed at the media FROM the Obama admin. Here are two print screens of an email I received that I am sharing unedited other than to redact email addresses. This email is from Dennis Montgomery, the man who designed \"The Hammer\". I got permission from him to share this with all of you: https://t.co/VoShYpNxOm For those who didn't read that, Montgomery sent me an email that said \"We breached the NYT network servers in FBI/CIA/NSA domestic surveillance programs I worked in more than once collecting information on their management and employees including reporters...\" (cont) ...\"I produced reporters notes and rough drafts ofthe reporters work prior to them releasing their main story to the FBI as part of my immunity agreement. This information was verified by the FBI. The FBI confirmed the data I produced on August 2015, and I testified..\"(cont) (cont) \"to this during my December 2015 meeting with the DOJ and FBI when I was under oath during my video taped interview at the DC FBI headquarters, which I received immunity for\"... Again, this is coming straight from Dennis Montgomery, but I felt it important enough to share with all of you. I am an open source journalist.

We are partnering with national, regional and local communities and organizations who believe that these fundamental rights are not negotiable and are willing to protect them. On Friday July 12th, 2019, Lights for Liberty: A Vigil to End Human Detention Camps, will bring thousands of Americans out to detention camps across the country, into the streets and into their own front yards, to protest the inhumane conditions faced by refugees. Across this country, we have witnessed acts against people fleeing persecution many of us thought we would never see in modern times. At Trump’s human detention camps, teen mothers and babies are held outdoors in “dog pounds.” We have witnessed the sick and elderly confined to “icebox” rooms for weeks at a time. Unbelievably, children as young as 4 months are taken from their parents, medicine is confiscated, &amp; medical care withheld, and LGBTQ and disabled individuals are held in solitary confinement. \"The Trump administration’s immigration policies and detention camps meet the United Nations' definition of genocide and crimes against humanity. Congress is refusing to stop the president and his policies. We cannot allow these atrocities to be perpetrated in our name.\" (quote @ECMcLaughlin) Perhaps most terrifying, refugees are beginning to be moved onto military grounds, where there will be a complete lack of oversight from the media, lawyers, &amp; human rights monitors. Many of us thought we would never see anything like this in modern times. “Now is the time for every person to stand up and say, ‘We will not accept this!’ No more hesitating. No more denial. No more fear. We need to be bold, and loud, and unrelenting. That’s the only way we can stop this,” said @KristinMinkDC. Lights for Liberty seeks to create this event in solidarity and allyship with communities most impacted by the abuse of our immigration system. We seek to work in solidarity with grassroots organizations both new and historic, those who are well-funded and on shoe-string budget. We are moved to mobilize with anyone: moms, dads, and people of moral conscience who cannot stand to see families and communities destroyed. Simply put, our country is at a tipping point. EVENT DETAILS: On July 12th, Lights for Liberty will shine a light on the horrific abuses of the Trump administration in human detention camps. People will begin arriving at 7pm local time at locations around the nation. At five main locations, legislators, activists, and organizers will speak until 9pm. At 9 pm local time, at every detention camp (there are 200+ and at least one in every state), and in cities, towns, and homes around America, a silent sea of candles will light up the nation. El Paso, TX, where migrants are being housed in outdoor conditions under a bridge with no running water for months at a time, is the anticipated site of the main Lights for Liberty vigil. Legislators, activists, organizers, &amp; members of impacted communities are expected to speak. Other key events are planned in: Homestead, FL, at a migrant child detention facility that has caused mass abuse and neglect; San Diego, near the point of entry site from Tijuana; in New York City, at Foley Square, where hundreds of migrants are processed through detention a day; and in Washington, DC, in front of the Capitol building, to demand action from Congress to end human detention and impeach the President. Details of exact vigil locations will be announced in the coming days. We welcome all individuals and organizations who support an end to human detention camps to participate in a main or local event. Please email us at contact@lightsforliberty.org if you or your organization is interested in sponsoring or supporting an event in your area. These events are being funded entirely out of the pockets of our organizing team. We have no sponsors and will not be asking for any financial contribution for these events. We will invite the public to directly contribute to organizations supporting migrant refugees on our donations page of our website. This moment has the opportunity to be a turning point in our nation’s history, a moment in which we bring these camps out of the shadows, stop America’s rapid slide into unspeakable horror, and demand that our country stand up for the values it strives to uphold. We invite you to stand beside us on the right side of history on July 12th. For more information please visit our website: https://t.co/hROv6uvKF7 And in the interim, from now until the end of this administration and its horrific policies, we invite you to light a candle in our window to keep vigil for all those still held in Trump's detention camps, and all those persecuted, marginalized and harmed by this administration.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"335060282"},"id_str":"335060282","name":"Elizabeth C.

The Rand Corp. describes the extremely effective Firehose of Falsehoods propaganda method: a rapid, continuous barrage of outrageous falsehoods. https://t.co/1Jg5CvgrJC 1/ Trump, who adopted the method from Putin, is a natural at this. From the researchers: “Don’t expect to counter the firehose of falsehood with a squirt gun of truth.”(p.9) Playing whack-a-lie will wear you out. Trump can reel off several lies in a minute. 2/ On the other hand, researching and refuting each lie can take hours. Simple lies are easy to tell. Complex truths are harder and don't fit well into sound bites. This is partly why the Rand Corp. researchers conclude that countering lies with the truth isn’t effective. 3/ Instead of trying to refute each lie, the researchers suggest preparing the population to expect lies, which we’ve now done. Trump's supporters know he lies and don't care. Trump’s critics also know he lies. After Trump exonerated himself, someone in my town put this out: https://t.co/cFNooCRi5v 4/ Instead of meticulously refuting each lie (which will wear you out &amp; Trump supporters know it's a lie) the researchers suggest countering the effect of the lies. Example: if the goal of the lies is to undermine public desire to vote, find ways to boost support for voting. 5/ Thus the solution is to “find ways to help put raincoats on those at whom the firehose of falsehood is being directed.”(P.10) I think we apply the same principle—counter the effect—to what we might call Trump’s Firehose of Outrageousness. https://t.co/1Jg5CvgrJC 6/ Trump calls the press the Enemy of the People. https://t.co/jYLO8gdKXb He's systematically dismantling the fed. government. He directed the AG to investigate whether there was corruption in the FBI/ Mueller investigation, and the AG did his bidding. https://t.co/KnUD6n67V7 7/ He tells his border agents to ignore judges. https://t.co/FWrjXk3imr He says elections are rigged. This all takes a toll on people. So we have to counter the effect. Trump is trying to create a crisis at the border. People are countering this by volunteering to help. . . 8/ (I went last summer) @RAICESTEXAS has received an outpouring of volunteers and donations. Trump’s larger goal is to undermine democratic institutions. Trump and his supporters don’t like democracy. (There've always been Americans who don’t.) Someone told me👇 https://t.co/QEB2XDZXGO 9/ (highlight in tweet was mine from a search) Trump knows how to undermine democracy. He learned it from Putin: Get enough citizens to lose confidence in democratic institutions. When that happens, the democratic institutions crumble. Ziblatt and Levitsky explain here👇 https://t.co/OyZhliChEl 10/ Clint Watts (former U.S. intelligence analyst) explains that the goal of Russian propaganda (which Trump uses) is to undermine democracy by getting people “to lose confidence in democratic institutions. . .\" https://t.co/LewKueyqVo 11/ Each time Trump does something outrageous, he accomplishes 4 things: (1) He keeps his base excited. (2) He enrages his critics. (3) He batters democratic institutions, and (4) He fulfills his campaign promise, which was to protect his followers from their “enemies.” 12/ Their enemies are the Democrats👇 loosely defined to mean anyone who doesn’t support Trump. Notice that when Trump does something outrageous, he creates a self-fulfilling loop: The more outraged his critics get, and the more euphoric his followers feel. Win-win for Trump. https://t.co/IrIDtc3DqO 13/ The more outraged his critics feel, the more they wear out and lose confidence in democracy. Win for Trump. This brings us to the Outrage Dilemma: How do we respond? We can’t normalize outrageousness. But too much outrage👇constant 5-star alarms—feeds the beast. https://t.co/BXCi15C3Qu 14/ Angry outrage with people lashing out at Trump supporters helps confirms this👇for Trump supporters. Another win for Trump. Overdoing angry outrage also persuades liberals that there is no more hope, it’s all over. Another win for Trump. It seems to me we need a balance. 15/ Dear People Who Underestimate Trump: It's clear to me the Firehose of Outrageousness is brilliant: the nature of it creates a win-win cycle for him by undermining democracy and increasing polarization. Maybe it isn't hard, maybe he's a natural, but he's good at it. 16/ Back to the dilemma: We must educate people about what Trump is doing. But some educators go too far. Instead of educating people about the dangers, they persuade people that it's done, Trump succeeded, it's all over. This is doing Putin's (and Trump's) work for them. 17/ So there must be a balance. Educate people without discouraging them. This is a sincere resister👇 He could also be a Putin bot. That's a problem. Our democracy is in trouble. That means right now it is fragile. What we do (or don't do) can make a big difference. https://t.co/6mDfaZxVuO 18/ This is my long-time follower👇(who had a good reason, aside from politics, to feel down yesterday). Why did he fall into this particular funk? Because of a whisper campaign that Trump won’t leave willingly, which causes people to lose hope &amp; feel despair. Win for Putin. https://t.co/cbnU5q5Txo 19/ For a solution, I think we take our cue from the Rand Corp research on how to counter the Firehose of Falsehoods. We find a way to counter the effects. Trump’s goal is to destroy democracy, so we counter his Firehose of Outrageousness by strengthening democracy. 20/ How? Volunteer, register voters, put a sign on your lawn, support publications that do good investigative journalism, get organized for 2020. I’ve assembled some ideas and put them here: https://t.co/Er6v4syFQS If you have other ideas, let me know and I’ll add them. end/ I accidentally let the image off Tweet 14.

Their stories were dismissed by prosecutors, who cut Epstein a lenient deal. His victims have never had a voice, until now. Part 1 of #PerversionofJustice: https://t.co/Rdg8AkvaDO \"I don't think anyone has been told the truth about what Jeffrey Epstein did,\" said Michelle Licata, now 30. \"He ruined my life and a lot of girls' lives. People need to know what he did and why he wasn't prosecuted so it never happens again.\" https://t.co/RCWvKdqYGX What he did, according to interviews with victims and police, was lure girls, aged 13 to 16, to his mansion for a \"massage.\" He would molest them, paying extra for oral sex and intercourse, and offering more money to bring him new girls, like an underage sex pyramid scheme. https://t.co/cVAjM5zGDn The evidence police collected to support the victims' stories was impressive. \"We had victims who didn't know each other, never met each other and they all basically told the same story.\" Epstein could have spent life in prison, but he only served a little more than a year in jail. Why? A secret deal was struck — an extraordinary plea arrangement — with help from future Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta. https://t.co/OFzvjGZJm0 Documents show Acosta, then a federal prosecutor, didn't just buckle under pressure from Epstein's lawyers; he and other prosecutors worked *with* them to contain the case — even as the FBI was uncovering evidence of a wider sex trafficking operation. The secretive deal allowed Epstein to quietly plead guilty to two felony prostitution charges. He admitted to committing only one offense against one underage girl, who was labeled a prostitute, even though she was just 14. \"She was was taken advantage of twice — first by Epstein, and then by the criminal justice system that labeled a 14-year-old girl as a prostitute,\" said the girl's lawyer. The pact Epstein negotiated with federal prosecutors was sealed so that no one — not even his victims — could know the full scope of his crimes. Court records, letters and emails show that the deal was negotiated, signed and executed behind victims' backs. Two police officers were willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein. They said they felt pressured by the state attorney to drop the investigation and downgrade it to a misdemeanor. https://t.co/u5nd8mTabV But they continued their work, finding evidence that supported the girls' allegations: Phone calls and messages like, \"Tanya can't come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice,\" and naked photographs of girls in Epstein's closet. https://t.co/AtE7BY9lHE \"I always hoped that the plea would be thrown out and that these teenage girls, who were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, would get to finally shed that label and see him go to prison where he belongs,\" said one detective. That detective died in May. #PerversionofJustice Part 2: https://t.co/x8K1CTnypW On the morning of his sentencing, none of Epstein's victims were in the courtroom — and that was by design. The victims couldn't voice their objections or possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the plea agreement altogether. One victim, Courtney Wild, who was 14 when she met Epstein, is suing the federal government, alleging that prosecutors kept victims in the dark as part of a conspiracy to give Epstein one of the most lenient deals for a serial child sex abuser in history. https://t.co/p9odz1Jm0K Once behind bars, #JeffreyEpstein didn't go to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida. He didn’t even spend much time in his cell. He was allowed to leave for work release six days a week. His year of \"house arrest\" included trips to New York and the Virgin Islands. Part 3 of #PerversionofJustice: https://t.co/lsynvA1rPr Today, ongoing litigation could reveal more about #JeffreyEpstein's crimes and who was involved. A lawsuit is set for trial Dec. 4 in Palm Beach County. As with every case involving Epstein, this one could further embarrass his once-impressive roster of A-list friends and associations, which included Bill Clinton, President Trump and Prince Andrew. A guide to Epstein's inner circle: https://t.co/E8dgNLZcy5 Several women who went to Epstein's home as underage girls are scheduled to testify against him for the first time. \"These guys will get it in the end because us girls are not gonna sit here and just let this keep happening.\" https://t.co/EeRNSOPblx .@jkbjournalist analyzed thousands of court records, lawsuits, witness depositions and FBI documents, filing motions in federal court and submitting FOIA requests. She and @EmilyMichot tracked down more than 60 women who say they were victims. https://t.co/QiUXGRm8y7 If you value investigative reporting like this, SUBSCRIBE, so our journalists can continue this important work. #ReadLocal https://t.co/gBBq49ylNu","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14085040"},"id_str":"14085040","name":"Miami Herald","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"434191"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"957"},"created_at":"Wed Mar 05 21:04:05 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"190335"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"23"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"102919"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"153535"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"4"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4475"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"6675"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.41602"},"all_hashtags":["MeToo","PerversionofJustice","JeffreyEpstein","ReadLocal"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184162"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"324"},"texto":"1. A few thoughts on Trump's dinner in honor of evangelicals, which I'll be discussing with @RickSmithShow later. Key context to consider is that fascism is concerned with defining who belongs to \"the nation\" or \"the people,\" and who doesn't. Internal enemies (Others) are needed. 2. This dovetails neatly with the way in which fundamentalist believers police who does and does not count as a member of their religious confession. This is critical to understanding the Christian Right's politics of \"religious freedom\": https://t.co/eyUgHlIICH 3. Indeed, as I have written elsewhere, \"Fundamentalism is authoritarianism in microcosm, or on the margins. Fascism is essentially fundamentalism in power.\" The vast majority of white evangelicals are authoritarian and fundamentalist. https://t.co/qZhVTc2QmK #EmptyThePews 4. One thing we can take away from the remarks Trump made while \"honoring\" radical evangelicals last night is that he still speaks their language very poorly, but their support for him has never been about him being one of them. It's about power, control, advancing their agenda. 4-a. From a religious studies perspective, this absolutely does not make them \"fake Christians,\" and that framing is an unhelpful, usually defensive, deflection that detracts from formulating effective responses to Christofascism. https://t.co/weB1ftcusX #Exvangelical #Resist 5. Here is the transcript of the remarks Trump made last night. He names a number of the guests, all hardline evangelicals (including token minorities like Ben Carson) who have shilled for him. This is part of a pattern. https://t.co/n7cYs70rCG #TuesdayThoughts #EmptyThePews 6. While previous presidential administrations have made efforts (to varying degrees) to reach out to religious leaders inclusively, Trump gives conservative, mostly white evangelicals an unprecedented degree of access that is exclusive. As his base, to him, they are the nation. 7. Here's an example of this pattern. Remember Trump's Middle East trip? Guess what \"news\" organization got exclusive access to him to cover it? Why, none other than the Christian Broadcasting Network of Pat Robertson infamy! https://t.co/OaIEo4vvxl #EmptyThePews #Resist 8. Thus, when Trump speaks of \"religious liberty,\" he is speaking of giving evangelicals free rein, including to discriminate against others. That's also their definition of \"religious freedom.\" Others don't count. This is Christofascism, and it is in power. #EmptyThePews https://t.co/9DCLURdczW 8-a. Conservative Catholics are also on board with this agenda, of course. They pursue the same politics, but Trump has been especially cozy with evangelicals. 9. You can call conservative evangelicals out as hypocritical, if you want. But that accomplishes little more than preaching to the choir, so to speak. Hypocrisy, such as we've seen in Catholic abuse coverups, is integral to authoritarian systems. https://t.co/cA3NdhkGct 10. Christofascists are not going to be won over. I thus see the most effective means of opposing them as follows. The end goal must be to get them out of power. The means to that end, apart from the ballot box, is to delegitimize them in the eyes of the wider American public. 11. This means working to reframe our national conversation on religion, particularly about evangelicalism. We must get the press to at least quote ex-evangelicals, scholars, researchers who argue that today's evangelicalism (and any fundamentalism) is incompatible with democracy 12. This is a hard sell in a country whose chattering classes exhibit a knee-jerk impulse to be deferential to any large (and well-heeled) Christian group. Researchers like @brucewilson and @FredClarkson who have been warning us about dominionism for years have faced ridicule. 13. We have, however, made some progress in changing public discourse on religion. A good part of that progress comes from the few evangelicals of conscience, and particularly from ex-evangelicals (or exvangelicals, or exvies), who have begun to be heard: https://t.co/zhn9wyWGNK 14. Journalists like @PaulHRosenberg, @ninaburleigh, @sarahposner, @SarahBurris, @NotoriousTIB, and others have begun to consider the #Exvangelical community to be stakeholders in discussions of evangelicalism. And that is critical to effectively opposing Christofascism. 15. #Exvangelical hashtag campaigns, like #ChurchToo (started by @hannahpaasch and @emilyjoypoetry) and #EmptyThePews (which I started) have gotten news coverage. That's a good sign. We need more of it. https://t.co/xO5oAYHfCB 16. The #Exvangelical community is also working to hold more offline events, such as an upcoming roundtable and public discussion in Tampa, FL. Join us there on September 8 if you can make it! National media will covere the event. Exvie novelist @JosiahMHesse will be present. https://t.co/qQh8TtklxH 16-a. We needed crowdfunding to pull off the Tampa roundtable, The Exvangelical Community: Paths, Projects, Prospects, and you all came through. Thank you for that! https://t.co/Oz2YAJMzxU 17. If you want to help us change the national conversation around evangelicalism and toxic Christianity in ways that will help to delegitimize the Christian Right, one of the best things everyone can do is simply to listen to and promote #Exvangelical voices. 18. Suggestions for exvies to follow #OnHere: @ToriGlass, @brchastain, @cindy_w_brandt, @anaisbelieve, @jonjones, @theKevinGarcia_, @charlotteirene8, @dwell_in_tents, @Lorisadventure, @Lily_Warrior, @KEBrightbill, @julieingersoll, @WheelerWorkshop, @gloriousbeth, @SbethCaplin 19. To get back to the WH dinner honoring evangelicals for their contributions to American society, a response that came from the #Exvangelical community was precisely highlight #EvangelicalContributions... in a way that is highly unflattering to evangelicals. Read the hashtag. 19-a. I did a writeup on the hashtag #EvangelicalContributions, featuring some of my favorite tweets, that you can read here: https://t.co/f1BECFELRm #Exvangelical #EmptyThePews #TuesdayThoughts #Resist 20.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184163"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"325"},"texto":"(THREAD) BREAKING: In a stunning development in the Trump-Russia investigation, former top Trump aide Sam Nunberg says he will defy a Mueller subpoena, thereby risking incarceration. I discuss the context and implications of this development here. Hope you'll read on and share. https://t.co/IYubC1NeUe 1/ Nunberg has become a well-known figure in the Trump-Russia saga due to him acknowledging that he's intentionally lied to the media in the past—requiring journalists to issue caveats whenever they cite him—and saying Don Jr. told his dad about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. 2/ The importance of this second point can't be overstated—as Nunberg is the second top Trump aide (with Bannon) to publicly express certainty Don Jr. told his dad of the campaign's secret meeting with Kremlin agents at Trump Tower on or around the time it happened. This matters. 3/ If Trump knew of the Trump Tower meeting with Kremlin agents at the time it happened, Trump may be responsible for a series of federal offenses relating to how he worked to cover up the nature of the meeting afterward and his knowledge of Russian ambitions/actions post-June. 4/ More importantly, Sam Nunberg just said on MSNBC that he believes \"Trump may have done something [illegal]\" during the presidential campaign, but he doesn't know what yet. He bases his opinion on interactions with the Trump campaign after he and Roger Stone were fired from it. 5/ Nunberg met with Mueller a week ago, and it's clearly that meeting that led to Mueller issuing a subpoena for any and all emails between Nunberg and certain Trump aides—basically, any Trump-Russia figure you could think of, including the president himself—since November 2015. 6/ Nunberg told MSNBC his meeting with Mueller focused on whether he (Nunberg) heard discussions of Trump Tower Moscow plans during the presidential campaign, and/or whether he saw any signs that Trump was developing U.S.-Russia policy on the basis of his ongoing business deals. 7/ During the course of his interview with MSNBC, Nunberg revealed that he did think that Trump was constantly aware throughout the presidential campaign of how his policies could affect his business—as he didn't expect to win. I and others have been saying this for many months. 8/ Nunberg also said Mueller wants him to testify for a grand jury Friday to incriminate Trump advisor/confidant Roger Stone, who I wrote days ago—see below—can now be indicted at a time of Mueller's choosing for lying to Congress. Looks like I was correct.https://t.co/IcT6bxWAxJ 9/ Nunberg is a Stone mentee, and his reasons for not wanting to cooperate with Mueller's subpoena are clearly pretextual—meaning, he's suddenly realized that while he can *say* what he wants to Mueller, his *emails* may, if he's compelled to produce them, tell a different story. 10/ Why do I say his excuses are pretextual? A week ago he told MSNBC the Mueller probe *isn't* a \"witch hunt,\" and now that he's being asked to produce his correspondence on the question, he suddenly says that it *is* a \"witch hunt.\" So clearly he has something he wants to hide. 11/ Why else do I say his excuses are pretextual? Because he's disregarding his attorney's advice. (He says his lawyer is likely to \"fire\" him.) Why else? Because his main reason for not complying—he says—is *it'd take too long to find all the emails requested*. Yes, seriously. 12/ Why else do I say Nunberg is refusing to produce documents for clandestine reasons? Because he's not just objecting to producing emails that could hurt Stone or be professionally embarrassing—he's *also* saying him having to produce emails to the president is \"over the line.\" 13/ So Nunberg is worried about his emails to Stone, and also, apparently, worried about his emails to and from Donald Trump—a man he now admits he believes \"did something wrong [illegal]\" during the 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps his emails reflect that knowledge or belief? 14/ There's more—and it's also stunning. Nunberg has perhaps inadvertently given us a view into exactly *what* he thinks Trump may have done wrong, as he told MSNBC repeatedly (and he brought this up voluntarily) that it'd be \"fine\" if Trump wanted Russia to release Clinton dirt. 15/ To be clear, it would *not* be fine. It would likely be Conspiracy to Commit Computer Crimes or Aiding and Abetting Computer Crimes or some sort of Bribery charge if Trump communicated directly or indirectly with the Russians about releasing their *stolen* Clinton materials. 16/ Take all Nunberg said and a scenario emerges: Nunberg said Trump knew of the June 2016 meeting because subsequent correspondence with the president or someone else confirmed to Nunberg that Trump knew of it and—after—tried to secretly facilitate Russia releasing Clinton dirt. 17/ Nunberg, in this view, is refusing to comply not just because he doesn't want to hurt Stone—though that may be so—or because complying with the subpoena could hurt him (though that may be so), but because he thinks his emails may lead toward the discovery of some larger plot. 18/ In his interview with MSNBC, Nunberg took the disconcerting tack of implying that he will be, he hopes, just \"the first\" of many former Trump aides to decide that the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and they shouldn't comply with it. That is dangerous, lawless rhetoric. 19/ Yet Nunberg is unsophisticated enough that he \"doesn't think [Mueller] will do anything\" if he refuses to comply with a federal subpoena (spoiler—he will) and publicly says Carter Page colluded with the Russians—see below—so who knows what his deal is. https://t.co/XQ0dp8e50g 20/ The upshot: Nunberg will produce these emails or be held in Contempt and go to jail. He has no valid legal defense against production and—with each word he says—underscores why Mueller wants this evidence: because it *could* reveal a smoking gun. Per—it seems—*Nunberg*. {end} PS/ No one thread can capture how strange these events are. For instance, at one point Nunberg tells MSNBC his proof no one is tampering with him is that he looked at \"no emails\" before deciding not to comply with Mueller's subpoena. Minutes later, he says \"I reviewed my emails.\" PS2/ I've represented enough defendants to recognize BS intended to cover a crime, so it was clear to me days after we learned of the June '16 Trump Tower meeting—where top Trump aides met Kremlin agents—that Trump knew of it. Do Nunberg's emails prove it? https://t.co/iPxobfFsCM PS3/ Was excited to hear John Harwood (NBC) use the phrase \"collusion in plain sight\" to describe Trump's public remarks encouraging Russia to release Clinton dirt. The \"collusion in plain sight\" theory (quid pro quo by private/public statements) is one I put forward a year ago.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"3223426134"},"id_str":"3223426134","name":"Seth Abramson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"676351"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"38"},"created_at":"Fri May 22 16:19:26 +0000 2015","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"53065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"24"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"10531"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"35251"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"439"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1469"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"2.25011"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

Or, 42 to survive it. YOU DO NOT GET TO LIFT ANYONE'S WORK. but you ESPECIALLY do not get to fucking steal how I language my fucking survival. and call it your own. Wooooo I am fucking shaking. Today, someone DM'd me asking for my contact info on someone else's behalf. I assumed this was for a reading. Damn. Was I wrong. Instead, I received some bizarre email from a \"young, up and coming poet\" talkin about \"I paraphrased a stanza from your poem\" \"Your original stanza reads, \"Hell-spangled girl / spitting teeth into the sink, / I'd trace the broken / landscape of my body / &amp; find God / within myself.\" . . . \"...My paraphrased stanza read \"Ramshackle / girl spitting teeth / in the sink. I trace the / foreign topography of / my body, find God / in my skin.\" Unfortunately, over time, the origin of the stanza slipped my mind and in compiling my manuscript and submitting the poem\" \"while not copied word for word, I did lift that image from you and paraphrased too closely for comfort. I hope you can understand it was not my intention to pass your work off as my own and I am deeply ashamed of this mistake. blud as an entirety really spoke to me...\" \"...In paraphrasing you, I had hoped to put our poems into conversation with each other and go on to explore new terrain opened up for me by your work. I am deeply ashamed of the mistake I made and hope you can accept my sincerest apologies.\" Bitch, I DON'T. Here's why: (from an interview in The Rumpus) \"I think “Gun Metal” is probably the best representation of my collection as a whole It starts with the image of “Ramshackle / girl spitting teeth / in the sink” Oh, and here's another reason why: https://t.co/n9YmD8IBYi My poem (written in 2011) which appeared in blud (Copper Canyon, 2018) : https://t.co/6VhEs7Q84T This part: \"Unfortunately, over time, the origin of the stanza slipped my mind...I forgot to give you credit for the original metaphor.\" MY BOOK WASN'T EVEN A YR OLD. Slipped your mind? and I can only guess that either the Pushcart peeps clocked the line snag or someone read that shit on Rumpus, because there's this cancelation: https://t.co/sBD3kpLBVb https://t.co/El7ThA5bXv I put so much work into blud &amp; couldn't tour w/ it. My mother is extremely ill. She's stalked me my entire life. When she learned my new last name, she Googled me, def not expecting to find the poems describing her abuses. It tipped her over. She got worse. Went on a rampage... Wrote bizarre 1-star reviews of every book she could find online. Pretended to be my paternal uncle on FB, shaming me for what I've written about my \"poor, Christ-loving mother\" (not knowing said uncle's locked up for 30 yrs) When I called her out, threatening to post court documents (I've been in the system since I was 3 mos. old) she called CPS on me. My kids were pulled out of class &amp; questioned by authorities because \"the claims were jus so outrageous we had to check in on them\" I was under investigation for 90 days. Though cleared, it was fucking triggering. She literally accused me of doing shit SHE had done to ME as a child She knew that would fuck w/ me. It did. &amp; I haven't written in 16 months. My poetry saves my life, but is also dangerous for me. blud was a necessary purge. I love the book. I love all the people I carried into it - my ancestors within the text, my friends, my family, chosen &amp; birthed. but that bitch's response to it sent me deep into a PTSD hole, &amp; I've not found my way out of it yet. So when some tricky little \"up and coming\" poet rolls up on my life &amp; tries to put it on, all I can say is, CLOWN, THIS WILL NOT BE COMFORTABLE. I'm just barely figuring out how to navigate it. Goddamn, don't gank my shit. I don't come from clean hands. YOU DO NOT. WANT. THIS. Who are we, if not our words? Who are we if we are not allowed to tell our own stories? I survived my own vanishing. I arrive in my art. That is where I map my forgiveness, my sorrow, my joys. Let it be mine. Don't change a single word of it. I need to come back to this, because that tattoo of hers is more than just a line. I was the youngest patient in the US to get braces back in the 80s. My orthodontist was stunned that I'd lost all my baby teeth. I was seven. My dad helped me lose those teeth, Ailey. Here's a line I never put in a poem: the tooth fairy doesn't come for teeth knocked down your throat.

Schiff is telling any camera he can get in front of there are 'mountains' of evidence for Russia collusion &amp; crimes by Trump. People are being told we all need to be VERY VERY AFRAID of what Schiff is doing, his endless, never ending investigation of the President from the House. Notice these are the same people who told you to be VERY VERY AFRAID of what Mueller was gonna deliver against Trump. Notice how these people you have been listening to have *effortlessly* segued from \"LOOK OUT HERE COMES MUELLER!\" to \"LOOK OUT HERE COMES SCHIFF!\" Oh for God's sake. Let me explain yet again the REAL CONCRETE DIFFERENCES between the 2 year long Mueller Special Counsel investigation and the dog and pony political theater Schiff is planning to do for the forseeable future: 1) Mueller is an ACTUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, a prosecutor with real legal powers to investigate and bring criminal charges. He led a team real *law enforcement investigators* and prosecutors who were allowed very broad discretion to search wherever they wanted to look. 2) Schiff is a POLITICIAN sitting on a political committee in the US Congress. He is NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT and has no criminal/law investigative capability. At best he can subpoena people to come testify, but he can only REFER people to the DOJ for prosecution. *Real law enforcement investigators with real powers just spent two years furiously digging high and low looking for ANYTHING they could use to throw Trump out of the White House. There was collateral damage, sadly but the MAIN thing is they came up EMPTY against Trump. Schiff is just blowing smoke here. He's got a shit hand. He's bluffing as hard as he can, and that's all it is: a bluff. When he writes reports from his committee &amp; sends it up to the DOJ insisting people be indicted, who's he gonna be sending those reports to? BILL BARR. So let's NOT be very afraid of Schiff waving his empty hand around for 2 years, pointing repeatedly at it, claiming it contains 'real evidence!'. You think Trump won't troll this guy endlessly? This reminds me of the ending of \"Phantom of the Opera\" https://t.co/mdwUvIyeYB \"STAND BACK YOU FOOLS, I HAVE THE EVIDENCE AGAINST TRUMP RIGHT HERE! BACK OFF!!\" https://t.co/ewXqVfYbJw \"I'M NOT KIDDING! DON'T MAKE ME USE THIS! DON'T MAKE ME PRODUCE THIS VITAL KEY EVIDENCE THAT WILL DESTROY YOUR PRECIOUS TRUMP AT LAST!

OH *GOD* THAT HURT!\" THE END https://t.co/kJXtPGjSN3 So when the usual doom criers do their usual doom crying, obsessively reporting EVERY DAY Schiff's threats, his promises of future DEVASTATING REVELATIONS against Trump, remember: people are trying to get you all worked up about a guy WILDLY GESTURING AT THIS OWN EMPTY HAND. And any reports and referrals that he would actually make against anybody, he'd bee handing them to....Attorney General Bill Barr. Who I suspect would not look very kindly on Schiff wasting his time by sending referrals that don't have any real evidence behind them. Asking what we need to 'do' about Schiff is like asking what we need to 'do' about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We don't need to DO anything except get out of their way and let them talk. People looking for constant OUTRAGE on here will always find *something* to be outraged about. OMG SCHIFF SAID THIS TODAY ABOUT TRUMP! Great! Some bloggers will spend the next 2 years getting worked up EVERY DAY about Schiff's latest wild pointing at his own clenched fist. To me that's like the people who watch Bill Kristol's Twitter so they can rush out their outraged response to whatever Never Trump stupidity he said today. Have they not noticed how increasingly irrelevant Kristol is? WHO CARES what he tweeted today? I don't. As Democrats descend into sheer lunacy and wild hand waving BS, along with Never Trump's increasingly irrelevance, there are more important things to focus on. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"39076082"},"id_str":"39076082","name":"Brian Cates","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"132334"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1"},"created_at":"Sun May 10 17:00:12 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"431831"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"24"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2301"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"8254"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"96"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"344"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"3.93663"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

Freeman was a publisher and land developer, and was the father of modern-day Bellevue, WA. https://t.co/ngaNhn7TUm 4) Beginning in about 1910, Freeman -- a GOP legislator and indeed one of the state's most powerful Republicans -- began a campaign aimed at driving Japanese immigrants from the state, and Japanese fishermen from U.S. waters. It reached a fever pitch in 1919. https://t.co/tbGfFk8dxk 5) Albert Johnson, who hailed from the relative backwater of Hoquiam, was a protege of Freeman's, and the two had a voluminous correspondence, which can be found in the Freeman archives at the University of Washington. I've read through these letters and many others. 6) Johnson, like Freeman, believed in the eugenics propaganda that was one of the popular subjects of the time. In particular, both had read \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White Supremacy\" and believed they were acting to prevent its predictions. https://t.co/sD3qzh26QL 7) This was a common thing among Washington Republicans, who made great hay agitating against Japanese immigration during this period. Various officeholders, especially rural legislators, found that piously talking about saving American civilization went over well with voters. 8) Gov. Louis F. Hart, a Republican, campaigned for his ultimately successful re-election on a promise to outlaw the leasing of any property by the Issei. https://t.co/aQKEk9lAPu 9) One of Hart's 1920 GOP primary opponents, John Stringer, took it a step further: “It is our duty to take every acre of land on Puget Sound away from the Japs and place it in the hands of our ex-soldiers.” 10) When the legislature convened early in 1921, a flood of anti-Japanese bills awaited. The first proposal would have made it mandatory to post American citizens as guards at any Japanese-owned hotel. Another called for an official investigation of the Japanese immigrants. 11) All these faltered in the legislative process. But the centerpiece bill—a land law that forbade ownership of land by all “aliens ineligible for citizenship,” and making it a criminal offense to sell or lease land to any such alien—flew through both houses unimpeded. 12) Flush with political victory, Miller Freeman had the final say on the matter. In an article addressed to the Japanese community, he minced no words: “The people of this country never invited you here. You came into this country of your own responsibility ... 13) \" .... large numbers after our citizens supposed that Japanese immigration had been suppressed. You came notwithstanding you knew you were not welcome. You have created an abnormal situation in our midst for which you are to blame.\" 14) In 1924, Albert Johnson, then chair of the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee, introduced a bill that would limit immigration to a 2 percent quota for each nationality, but prohibiting the admission of any “aliens ineligible for citizenship” -- i.e., Asians. 15) This was predicated in large part on a 1922 Supreme Court ruling, Ozawa v. United States, which ruled that people from Asian nations could be excluded from citizenship and naturalization. https://t.co/ErVSG2q2Br https://t.co/kfYnDAtpbN 16) Johnson's racial attitudes were well known. He was the head of 'The Eugenics Research Association', a group which opposed interracial marriage and supported forced sterilization of the mentally disabled. https://t.co/wRb1JC9kew 17) He believed in other components of eugenics, including its anti-Semitism. In support of his 1919 proposal to suspend immigration he included a quote from a State Department Official referring to Jewish people as \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\" 18) Johnson's measure handily passed the House, but was amended in the Senate to allow for a quota from Japan. However, at the last moment, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge weighed in, claiming that a warning from the Japanese ambassador constituted a \"threat.\" The House version won. https://t.co/z0JTKywvLa 19) In Japan, the public had been closely watching the passage of the alien land laws with mounting outrage. And when news of the passage of the Asian Exclusion Act was announced, mass protests broke out in Tokyo and other cities. https://t.co/0YBfuKELTg 20) As Pearl Buck would later observe, the then-nascent movement for American-style democracy, which had been slowly gaining momentum in Japan, was effectively wiped out overnight. The military authoritarians who would control the nation for the next 20 years gained mastery. 21) Of course, one of the cornerstones of their rule was a bellicose anti-Americanism that would finally reach fruition in late 1941. https://t.co/hvb21qA4nF 22) Moreover, the groundwork laid by the success of the nativist campaign led to one of the nation's great historical atrocities -- namely, the incarceration of 110,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. https://t.co/nqpVZh3z9l 23) All along the Pacific Coast, many of the men leading this campaign -- beginning in 1910, and continuing all the way up through 1942, when congressional hearings on the coast featured public testimony demanding removal of the Japanese -- were Republicans like Miller Freeman. https://t.co/SyDejEhYDX 24) One final note: The campaign described above in Washington state was replicated elsewhere on the Coast; both California and Oregon passed Alien Land Laws, and their congressional delegations joined in support of the Johnson-Reed Act. As always, both Rs and Ds participated.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2602262088"},"id_str":"2602262088","name":"David Neiwert","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"29160"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2153"},"created_at":"Thu Jul 03 21:31:24 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"8065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"24"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"330"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1797"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"14"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"75"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.03036"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

Ya know, checking the Twitter; reminding Babyfingers he's going to die in prison; comparing the Vice President to a greasy loofah. The usual. Then up popped an ominous Twitter notice. The Hoarse was on lockdown. 2/ https://t.co/9aCciSLHkP \"Ehrmagod, but noooees!\" I said to myself \"I'm not cut out for Twitter prison. Someone will slip me the jailhouse shank emoji!\" I was terrified. A whole season of \"Oz\" flashed before my eyes. So, I hastily filed a desperate appeal... but then the bars slammed shut. 3/ https://t.co/9Uih3Pc6wf Hearing those Twitcatraz doors slam shut changes a man though. In Twison, they've got a saying. \"You can do the time or the time can do you.\" That's stone cold truth right there. So, I set about to screw my courage to the sticking place and make the best of it. 4/ By a long five minutes into my sentence, I had come all the way around... That's willpower right there. Mental toughness. \"I bet it's just like Shawshank Redemption.\" I convinced myself \"Yes, it will be just like that. I bet I'll get to meet Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman!\" 5/ https://t.co/CMh4WKUftF Oh, the mind can talk itself into anything when facing the inconceivable - like 12 hrs off Twitter. As it turns out, Twison is NOTHING like Shawshank Redemption. And I now SERIOUSLY regret crawling through a half-mile sewer pipe just to get into character. That was unwise. 6/ https://t.co/9bJ3TdEQI9 I mean, there's no one to talk to. You get your notifications but can't reply. It's like one of those nightmares where you want to post a screaming .gif but no one can see it. So, I had to find diversions. Things to do. I mean, I had an entire half-day to kill. 7/ First, I ambled off into the woods to enjoy nature where I stumbled upon this sad testament to man's cruelty to both the environment and VWs. 8/ https://t.co/Gn1dqyDDLh After a few hours of elbow grease and a few YouTube videos, I had her fully restored. I named her Virginia Woolf. Cuz, ya know, VW... and I'm all literary and sh**. Alas, I still had 7 hrs left. Such is the speed of my handiwork. I'm a renaissance horse. What can I say? 9/ https://t.co/stRYUPyD8r So, I ate a sandwich and busted out the ol' easel. Not one to shy from ambitious projects, I drew this full-scale reproduction of Picasso's Guernica using only a single miniature golf pencil. It now hangs in a local museum. Children weep when beholding its powerful beauty. 10/ https://t.co/keqYpzKyfj ...but then I was out of time-killers and had no choice but to tuck back into Twitter to see see why I had been banned in the first place. I mean, Twitter Jail is a serious matter. I must have gotten dinged for a doozy, no? 11/ Yeah, not so much. A couple weeks ago, someone posted an innocuous comment about people who lean up against subway poles... 12/ https://t.co/WV8lwt15mG I responded with a movie reference from the 1990 classic \"The Grifters\". 13/ https://t.co/V2lgUFNXzE In the movie, the mobster tells Anjelica Huston that if you beat someone with a sack of oranges, they bruise up but don't suffer any real injuries. Now, mind you, this is a rather absurd premise. But, hey, it's a movie. Apparently, the Twitter mods never saw it. 14/ https://t.co/EystGy5y8J The next guy down the thread saw it though... I mean, it's not like a movie that was nominated for four Academy Awards was a sleeper. Where's your culture, Twitter?! 15/ https://t.co/FZZqcPSOdq Let's just ignore the fact that it was a movie line directed in jest. Apparently, Twitter thinks I was proposing actual violence directed at a vague audience of \"people who lean on subway poles\". Yes, that's it. Ya got me. I was trying to incite citrus-wielding vigilantes. 16/ https://t.co/NWnNWvIN5i Because that makes perfect sense. If there's one tactic that would definitely work on a super-crowded downtown 4 train in Manhattan, it's elbowing your way in with a pillowcase full of oranges hoping to work up enough fruit-speed for a good orange-beatin'. Dumba**es. 17/ https://t.co/BKfFoE7snO So, just to recap, Twitter put me on lockdown under the premise that I was some bad actor looking to fire up the vitamin C-heavy equivalent of Antifa. Fruit Warriors. Yes, that's quite logical. p.s. they actually have an orange-throwing festival in Italy but I digress 18/ https://t.co/u3au8jcNFh Now, mind you, while Twitter drew a hard line when it comes to fruit violence, the actual head of the f***ing KKK was free to post sh** so racist today that it got picked up in the media.

Twitter. 23/ https://t.co/LK70mPlhLn Twitter's arbitrary enforcement of vague terms of service for regular users is just plain poor.

This may take a while and I know how busy you must be but let's start with substance then move to process. Shall we? 1/ https://t.co/SUwGMdH43t On substance, I think you know the answer. And if you listened to the one person who is your colleague and who actually knows the border (and is from your party), you would understand why the dynamics of border security are fluid and require a layered, not static, response. 2/ That would be Will Hurd so just read this first. https://t.co/Wz0kLrBBA6 If viewing better than reading, how about this: https://t.co/bckDsvHkQh 3/ So, why would anyone who lives, works or actually spent a career (I think you know my bio by now. . . ) in homeland security and border management not favor a wall? The alternatives -- man/women power, technology, barriers (yes, lest you forget, the Obama Administration built nearly 800 miles of barriers, drones, dogs, etc. -- are so much better. See unlike a war zone (I'll defer to you on that), a port of entry must permit flow. It is how we function as a market economy. So us \"experts\" think about it in terms of how do we better \"secure flow\" 5/ build a wall. So let's take your example of the fentanyl arrest. Think about it: it was stopped because it wasn't a wall. It was intelligence, man/women power, technology and DOGS that led to the arrest. That's how it should work; it's not a sign that there is a better 6/ alternative with a static solution. So I suspect you get this but I\"m happy to explain. On process, though, you are the congressman. And you know that your job is to weigh priorities with funding. 7/ So let's assume you have 100 pennies to spend across competing priorities. And so let's say you want ALL of them to be spent on border enforcement (not sure how your constituencies would feel about that). 8/ How would you spend them? No one, not even CBP until last few months, ever even thought a wall made sense because it would take years (tell me how that solves a crisis, but as you know there isn't one), require eminent domain (your Texas colleagues have thoughts on that), and 9/ would pull from the dynamic security that does work. So that us \"experts\" oppose the wall is just an unbecoming comment. Us experts include your Republican colleagues and those of us who have worked border issues in government. And, again, CBP. 10/ Anyway, I feel silly writing this. You know this and if you don't happy to continue the conversation but one final thing. . . about that mansplaining thing. 11/ I wasn't going to re-engage it. I don't want to be know as the \"expert\" who accused you of mansplaining any more than you want to be known for an SNL skit. It's not why we do what we do; it's personal and I took to heart what you said in response to the SNL skit. Civility. 12/ And as a graduate of Harvard, your odd mentions of it in every tweet to me (this is the first time I have mentioned it) suggests its a dig. I'm sorry you feel that way about what you may or may not have learned here. We try to teach responsible bipartisan leadership. 13/ Some of us have spent a career in and out of government, or media, or private sector, and the academy (she is me). But I would take your interest in my opinions more seriously if they didn't include such odd personal attacks. 14/ It's not becoming of your position. I wish you best as you assess this and your role. And you engage with women and men whom you disagree with in a much less personal manner. I believe the facts, history, economics and policy are against building a wall. You don't. 15/ Support your point with facts, history, economics and policy. Not with mocking a woman. Because, well, she is me. And you will lose that one. 16/16 Hi. So I'm back online and thanks for all these responses. I was rushed when I wrote this so I think I'm allowed to continue because in the responses it occurred to me that the basic tenets of security were relatively new to folks and I\"ll try to arm you all with what I know 17/ to help in this debate. So back to substance. Earlier I mentioned how we want fluid responses to support the (sometimes competing) goal of \"secure flow.\" It's how we think about movement in our homeland. (I'll leave the moral and legal issues about a wall to others). 18/ But there is also a second tenet for how we think about complex security challenges: layered security. The basic goal here is to ensure that you don't build a system around, what we call, a \"single point of failure.\" 19/ A \"single point of failure\" is to be avoided at all costs because if it is penetrated, then the whole system goes down. 9/11 and cockpit doors; Sony hack and a single system administrator; BP oil spill and a blowout preventer. So, ideally we build systems that have multiple 20/ barriers so that the access point is either avoided (i.e. you can't get into a system through cyber attack because the system is layered and bifurcated) or difficult to access (i.e. lock the cockpit door, but have multiple security layers before entry to plane.) 21/ So, on substance, the \"wall\" defeats those two primary tenets of protecting a complex system: balancing security with flow (the border and points of entry) and avoiding the single point of failure (the wall can be overcome by a ladder or tunnel). 22/ It's just a way to think about the substantive arguments about real security. Moral debates are important; legal ones as well. But it's important that critics of the wall also have the tools to explain why we aren't \"soft\" on security, but actually take it quite seriously. 23/ Ok, I think I may have violated some unwritten rule of twitter and threads, but my objection to the wall (even assuming I could get it for free and in a day, which I can't) are not just \"that's not who we are\" or \"immigrants are good for America.\" 24/ I'm not known for being soft on security, border or otherwise. And so in the realm of policy options, the wall fails every standard that we have learned in homeland security for the last 20 years. Now, I say good night. 25/25","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"21461359"},"id_str":"21461359","name":"Juliette Kayyem","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"124578"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"674"},"created_at":"Sat Feb 21 03:46:53 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"25715"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"28033"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"228340"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1121"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"9134"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.33065"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

Yesterday, @15poundstogo asked an interesting question of @ProfMJCleveland: https://t.co/4qQogOFVZq This was something I had completely forgotten about. Let’s go through some background. 2. Back in 2017, Comey had testified, and a NY Times article had reinforced, that James Comey made the decision to announce that the FBI would not be charging Clinton in the email case (cont) 3. (cont) , in part because of “Russian intelligence” in the form of emails between the DNC/DOJ and Open Society that proved Lynch was attempting to stifle the case. https://t.co/XmM2rdJuKO https://t.co/kynAFg8mKt 4. In this “Russian Intelligence Memo” (Comey states he never saw an email, just intelligence) it states that there was an email between DWS and Leonard Bernardo of Open Society which read that Lynch had been in touch with Renteria (a senior Clinton campaign staffer) (cont) 5. (cont) and told her she wouldn’t let the investigation into Clinton “go too far”. https://t.co/63czX3RU3z https://t.co/Ju5l6CGY8T 6. Timeline: James Comey receives “intelligence” from a “source” in March of 2016: https://t.co/gmMtc7QZIv https://t.co/uCYXEY29ZB 7. The DNC announced that it had been “hacked” by the “Russians” the week of 6/15/16 and relies on information from it’s “cybersecurity firm” Crowdstrike: https://t.co/a7yKNvJlzE https://t.co/owGLHW5dK4 8. The story makes its way into the MSM in May of 2017. This may all be repeating old and tired news for you. I am about to add a really interesting piece here. This is where the lightbulb went off for me. Enter one @MichaelRCaputo 9. On May 22, 2018, Caputo did a spree of interviews that threw me for a massive loop. He began talking about informants who were approaching him throughout the campaign. This one in particular really grabbed my attention. 10. Caputo says that in the first week of May, 2016 he was approached by an intermediary, a former government official, who told him they had Clinton related emails at that government organization and they wanted to get to the Trump campaign https://t.co/Fe92x0Hkd7 11. He states that this conversation occurred on May 6th, and would continue for several days. He states that this intermediary is willing to go on the record about these interactions and the facts behind them. He states that staff members of “the agency” (cont) 12. (cont) (which he can not name) said they had Clinton related emails which at the time he believes to be the deleted emails. 13. After Caputo leaves the campaign in June, the intermediary returns AGAIN, wanting to provide the information. Caputo does not want to take posession of these emails, and so he declines to work with the intermediary. 14. When this story broke, there was a big back and forth, with the contractor denying and walking back information- that is a sub story we wont get into here. 15. The real kicker comes at the end of the interview with Cavuto. Caputo states, that at the time, the intermediary spoke about the content of some of the emails, and that one of them dealt with a Swedish waiver on Iran that was given at the time $26m was delivered to the CF. 16. Caputo was STUNNED when that information was released in a wikileaks Podesta drop in Late October. 17. Caputo states he went back to the HPSCI to clarify answers he had already given to the committee about Russians approaching him with emails, and that he shared the details of these encounters with Mueller, the HPSCI, Huber, etc. to no avail- no one wanted to touch it. 18. I spoke with Michael Caputo yesterday to hammer down some details of this story and he informed me that his attorney, Dennis Vacco, who is a former US Attorney for the Western District of NY and former NY AG shared the details of this with Durham yesterday. 19. Why is this important? Because it lends further confirmation to the fact that the US IC was IN POSSESSION of the “hacked” emails taken from the DNC and Podesta as early as March of 2016. 20. It brings further confirmation to the fact that Comey was in possession of the ACTUAL emails and NOT a “Russian” intelligence document- meaning he likely knew back then what the \"hack\" really was. 21. It lends further confirmation that the US IC KNEW that these “hacked” documents would be released, and that a cover of “Russian interference and hacking” was placed on this leak to further perpetuate the narrative. 22. It insinuates that Comey knew and had in his posession at least some of the DNC emails before their publication, and I will leave the rest of the possible speculation to you. So to answer the original question? YES. Mueller SHOULD have investigated this. 23. To watch the video I did at the time explaining the story and lending more detail, please watch: https://t.co/hnS9U7gTou I want to add to this - I am aware that the last dated email is May 25, 2016. However, this is too compelling to deny the fact that there is a possibility that the IC knew these emails were being taken the entire time, and since it WAS NOT a hack, couldn’t close the leak. Of course, this is speculation on my part, but the corroboration between the stories is so compelling (as I said) that I’m willing to rethink the timeline. I think we have to be willing to rethink k established narratives and timelines. For that reason, my thread will stand","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"24822993"},"id_str":"24822993","name":"Tracybeanz","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"124551"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"981"},"created_at":"Tue Mar 17 02:27:13 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"36331"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"5286"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"13454"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"211"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"538"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.27635"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

I served in the Army. I was trained as an infantryman. A grunt. That’s about as nuts-and-bolts as it gets in the military. (THREAD) https://t.co/GFX5sF0LLY Infantry training is ongoing. Infantry units train constantly. All the time. It’s always something. To the point of being monotonous. If we weren’t at the firing range, we were doing hands-on tactical training. If not tactical, then classroom prep. Always. Something. Thousands of hours of training and learning how to kill other people. I am a trained killer. That’s what an infantryman does. They kill. Other soldiers will laugh this off. “Okay, killer.” But they know I’m right. Deep down, that’s your purpose as an infantryman: to kill. It starts early. Basic training is psychological. You’re supposed to get comfortable with killing. You’re prepared to face this reality. In my barracks at basic training, there was a giant mural of a skull-and-crossbones on the floor. Our official nickname: “Death Dealers”. We were taught call-and-response chants. Ex: “What makes the grass grow?” “Blood, blood, blood makes the grass grow!” So many drills have the cry “Kill!” in them. I’m surprised we weren’t required to shout it after eating a meal. Hell, we probably were. I’m not here to tell you military training is bad. I am not a pacifist. Evil threats exist, and violence--as a last resort--is sometimes required. Someone has to kill. But that power has been frequently been abused by our government and held unaccountable in day-to-day life. Because someone has to kill and the killing falls to the military, psychological training like that makes killing easier. But regardless of where you happen to fall on this method of training, we need to take better accountability of it in the civilian world. Thousands of hours of learning how to kill other human beings. Day after day, month after month, year after year. Rewiring of the brain. It becomes second nature. Your body becomes fluent in the language of killing. I’m a flaming liberal. I’m a gun owner but don’t collect them. My idea of “fun” is singing karaoke in a tiara, not a day shooting guns. But there is no doubt in my mind that, if needed, I could kill other human beings efficiently. Tactically. Without hesitation. That's training. I haven’t worn a uniform in almost seven years, but it would be like riding a bike. It’s ingrained. I doubt it’ll ever go away. That’s the point of military training: muscle memory, acting without hesitation, resorting to a part of your brain on autopilot. In April 2009, Homeland Security released a report warning of the recruitment of veterans by radical groups: https://t.co/Lahh8xZgrn https://t.co/B5w5bZBcJd White supremacy tied to military training was noted as a catalyst for a heightened national security risk, which is basically what we’ve seen come to fruition a decade later: https://t.co/mdEB59eVA3 Predictably, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano was derided as disrespecting the troops. She was forced to issue several apologies. Never mind that Napolitano had only ever demonstrated the utmost respect for our folks in uniform. Never mind that a 2008 FBI report identified 203 military veterans in white supremacist terrorist groups: https://t.co/wwaNe9t6D8 https://t.co/1tAS90V9Vo Never mind Charlottesville and the mix of military vets among the little boys playing soldier: https://t.co/kFDqERjGkc Never mind that a Marine killed JFK or that an Army infantryman was behind the Oklahoma City Bombing or the numerous instances of war veterans committing violent crimes using their training. Example: U.S. Army Rangers robbing a bank. https://t.co/Vft4mNumAu Or the higher rate of violence against women (in this case: IPV) among Active Duty military and veterans versus civilians: https://t.co/TcSoFGHDJ7 Or that the higher rate of IPV in the military is linked to PTSD and traumatic brain injuries: https://t.co/9ei4CHp0DA Or—and this is important—the well-established relationship between mass shootings and violence against women. A great piece on that subject by Rebeca Traister can be found here: https://t.co/TRdgM1iMc2 https://t.co/QfusLscxTV Surely, that link between violence against women and subsequent mass shootings must count as evidence of terrorism. This is how the FBI defines domestic terrorism: https://t.co/mFOgrDWyB1 https://t.co/uACnt7uPhd Not sure why a mass shooting inspired by hatred of women doesn’t qualify as terrorism… unless, maybe, we don’t respect women as people? Not exactly the most comfortable truth in the national discourse. White men are seeing a loss of power, feel victimized, have that irrational entitlement radicalized through white supremacist propaganda, and commit acts of terrorism. But because they’re white and not shouting “Allahu Akbar”, they’re dismissed as \"nuts\", or more charitably: “nice guys gone wrong.” To admit to “terrorism” by ordinary white men would require asking deeper questions of ourselves, especially those of us in power, i.e. White House. To admit to “terrorism” by military veterans would require a vast reworking of our systems of recruitment, training, and mental health. Instead, we grant an access of powerful weaponry to those most trained to use it and most likely to do so in brutal acts of terrorism. An irony of all this is that though we fall back solely on the excuse of “mental health” to wave away acts of terrorism by white men, we neither 1) attempt to comprehensively address mental health in our country nor 2) effectively restrict access to weapons due to it. /thread","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"15907183"},"id_str":"15907183","name":"Charlotte Clymer🏳️‍🌈","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"219647"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3773"},"created_at":"Tue Aug 19 18:00:06 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"131321"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"15359"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"77932"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"614"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3117"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.16713"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818416c"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"334"},"texto":"Attorney General Barr has deliberately misrepresented key aspects of Mueller’s report and decisions in the investigation, which has helped further the president’s false narrative about the investigation. After receiving Mueller’s report, Barr wrote and released a letter on March 24 describing Barr’s own decision not to indict the president for obstruction of justice. That letter selectively quotes and summarizes points in Mueller’s report in misleading ways. Mueller’s report says he chose not to decide whether Trump broke the law because there’s an official DoJ opinion that indicting a sitting president is unconstitutional, and because of concerns about impacting the president’s ability to govern and pre-empting possible impeachment. Barr’s letter doesn’t mention those issues when explaining why Mueller chose not to make a prosecutorial decision. He instead selectively quotes Mueller in a way that makes it sound—falsely—as if Mueller’s decision stemmed from legal/factual issues specific to Trump’s actions. But, in fact, Mueller finds considerable evidence that several of Trump’s actions detailed in the report meet the elements of obstruction, and Mueller’s constitutional and prudential issues with indicting a sitting president would preclude indictment regardless of what he found. In noting why Barr thought the president’s intent in impeding the investigation was insufficient to establish obstruction, Barr selectively quotes Mueller to make it sound as if his analysis was much closer to Barr’s analysis than it actually was: Barr quotes Mueller saying the evidence didn’t establish that Trump was personally involved in crimes related to Russian election interference, and Barr then claims that Mueller found that fact relevant to whether the president had the intent to obstruct justice. But Mueller’s quote is taken from a section in which he describes other improper motives Trump could have had and notes: “The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.” None of that is in Barr’s letter. As a result of Barr’s March 24 letter, the public and Congress were misled. Mueller himself notes this in a March 27 letter to Barr, saying that Barr’s letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.” Mueller: “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.” To “alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen,” Mueller urged the release of the report’s introductions and executive summaries, which he had told Barr “accurately summarize [Mueller’s] Office’s work and conclusions.” Barr declined; he allowed the confusion to fester and only released the materials three weeks later with the full redacted report. In the interim, Barr testified before a House committee and was misleading about his knowledge of Mueller’s concerns: Barr was asked about reports “that members of [Mueller’s] team are frustrated…with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?” Barr absurdly replied: “No, I don’t…I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.” Yet Mueller had directly raised those concerns to Barr, and Barr says he “suspect[s]” they “probably” wanted more materials put out, as if Mueller hadn’t directly told him that. In subsequent statements and testimony, Barr used further misrepresentations to help build the president’s false narrative that the investigation was unjustified. Barr notes that Mueller did not “find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.” He then declares that Mueller found “no collusion” and implies falsely that the investigation was baseless. But whether there’s enough evidence for a conviction of a specific crime which Mueller thought was appropriate to charge is a different and much higher standard than whether the people whom Mueller investigated had done anything worthy of investigation. In truth, Mueller’s report describes concerning contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and people in or connected to the Russian government. For instance, Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner took a meeting with a Russian lawyer whom Trump Jr. had been told worked for the Russian government and would provide documents to “incriminate Hillary,” as part of the Russian government’s “support for Mr. Trump.” It’s wrong to suggest that the fact that Mueller did not choose to indict anyone for this means there wasn’t a basis to investigate whether it amounted to a crime or “collusion,” or whether it was in fact part of Russia’s efforts to help Trump’s candidacy. Barr says the White House “fully cooperated” with the investigation and that Mueller “never sought” or “pushed” to get more from the president, but the report says Mueller unsuccessfully sought an interview with the president for over a year. The report says the president’s counsel was told that interviewing him was “vital” to Mueller’s investigation and that it would be in the interest of the public and the presidency. Still Trump refused. The president instead gave written answers to questions submitted by the special counsel. Those answers are often incomplete or unresponsive. Mueller found them “inadequate” and again sought to interview the president. Ultimately, the special counsel “recogniz[ed] that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily” and chose not to subpoena him because of concerns that the resulting “potentially lengthy constitutional litigation” would delay completion of the investigation. Barr has so far successfully used his position to sell the president’s false narrative to the American people. This will continue if those who have read the report do not start pushing back on his misrepresentations and share the truth.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"233842454"},"id_str":"233842454","name":"Justin Amash","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"327168"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"5760"},"created_at":"Tue Jan 04 07:09:11 +0000 2011","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"16136"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"136203"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"546463"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"5448"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"21859"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.15844"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

They are outraged by the treatment of immigrant kids in concentration camps on the southern border! 2. How can this happen? they tell us. How can the United States, land of the free, the home of the brave, treat the poor and the tired and the hungry as if they were political prisoners remanded to the Gulag? 3. Well, I’ll tell you. It’s not only because the president and his administration are fascist. To be sure, the Democrats did not launch a “zero tolerance” policy that belies federal law and the human right to asylum. 4. No, the Democrats are not building walls. No, the Democrats did not unleash, as Donald Trump did, the closeted Aryans of US Customs and Border Patrol. But the Democrats have done plenty to contribute to this debacle. 5. The Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, once believed the Republicans were dealing in good faith when they demanded security in exchange for supporting immigration reform. 6. To that end, the Obama administration, with the blessing of congressional Democrats, spent billions and billions to secure the southern border. (This was in keeping with the previous administration’s post-9/11 military buildup.) 7. The Obama administration, moreover, deported more people than all presidents combined (up to that point). Sure, the Democrats were splitting up immigrant families but the hope was from pain would come reform, specifically a pathway to citizenship. 8. The Republican leadership, however, never intended to work with the administration on immigration reform. To be sure, some “moderates” like US Senators Lindsey Graham and the late John McCain tried and succeeded in crafting deals with Senate Democrats. 9. But even they surely knew it didn’t matter what they did. Every time the Senate passed an immigration package, the House killed it. 10. Why? By 2013, the Republican base had decided anything short of a border lock-down was dangerously insecure. The party’s base had decided anything smacking of reform smacked of amnesty. These were and are impossible standards, and the Republicans knew it. 11. But as long as the Democrats kept thinking they could satisfy those standards, as long as the Democrats kept throwing money at the border while waiting for the right-wing fever to break, the GOP was happy. It took pleasure in its advantage. 12. And it continues to, even though it is establishing concentration camps to shelter what can only be called political prisoners, people jailed not for doing something wrong—they have the legal right to seek asylum per law—but for being disliked by the current president. 13. None of this would have been possible if the Democratic Party had not accepted for years for the sake of political expediency the Republican Party’s utter and toxic bad faith. 14. None of this would have been possible without the billions and billions that went into securing the border over the last two decades. 15. Concentration camps and the criminal treatment of innocent kids scandalized the Democrats this week but none of it would have been possible without complicity on the part of the Democrats. 16. Borders do not define a nation. Borders reflect a nation, meaning that problems on the border tend to reflect problems elsewhere in the body politic so that the more attention paid to the nation’s borders, the less attention is paid to the nation's real problems. 17. Put another way, the Democrats, in playing along with the Republicans, are not only surrendering their political leverage; they are drawing attention away from issues where they have a much stronger hand. 18. Imagine if instead of spending billions on “border security,” the Democrats fought instead to deregulate the southern border in the name of openness, free labor and free enterprise. 19. Here’s how Manlio Graziano put it in his short book, What Is a Border? He said: 20. Each proposed false solution to a real problem only ends up creating new problems. The real problem ... has opened the floodgates to the excessive passion for borders is the shifting of power, that is, the shifting of the economic ... geopolitical axis of the world. 21. Graziano: Thinking the problem can be resolved by strengthening borders is like thinking that one can lose weight by breaking the scale. Indeed, it’s much worse: breaking the scale at the most leads to a false good conscience and a few more pounds; 22. Graziano: coming up with false solutions to real political problems allows us to have a good conscience for only a bit longer because there will inevitably be new and more serious problems, setting off a dangerous downward spiral. 23. The Republicans, in making a fetish of the southern border, have been leading the way in America’s downward spiral, because the party has no good new ideas proportional to the political and economic challenges awaiting us in the 21st century. 24. That wouldn’t be so bad if the Democrats weren’t so eager to prove they too stand for security, thus contributing to a false solution to a real problem that’s only making things worse. 25. As in the past, the Democrats continue to accept the GOP's bad faith. https://t.co/MwwYeGfO5k","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"110213124"},"id_str":"110213124","name":"John Stoehr's Editorial Board","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"26232"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"6686"},"created_at":"Sun Jan 31 19:21:17 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"111399"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"70"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"135"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.91578"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Disgust"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

Why do we need so many neurons? To find out, we recorded thousands of them in mouse visual cortex. Here’s some data, and a link to the paper: https://t.co/XsrxRsLzS1 https://t.co/fnfySyoEH0 2. One reason to have so many neurons may be that they each have different jobs: Neuron A recognizes the pointedness of a fox’s ears, Neuron B recognizes the color of the fox’s fur. Neuron C recognizes a fox nose, etc https://t.co/1t5hOn1WKn 3. When enough of these neurons activate, the brain as a whole can recognize a fox. https://t.co/ZVk3zPj0YS 4. What if some neurons “fall asleep” on the job and don’t respond to the image? This actually happens very often, and yet the brain is remarkably robust to these failures. 5. Even if 90% of the neurons don’t do their job, we can still recognize the fox. Even if we randomly change 90% of the pixels, we can still recognize the fox. The brain is robust to a lot of manipulations like that. https://t.co/7oi9bOm9UL 6. Artificial neural networks also use millions of neurons to recognize images. https://t.co/sOY5Emm3Qa 7. Unlike brains, machines are not so robust to small aberrations. Here is our fox and next to it the same fox very slightly modified and now the machine thinks it’s a puffer fish! https://t.co/Bd9ZDyY7QJ 8. These are called “adversarial images”, because we devised them to fool the machine. How does the brain protect against these perturbations and others? 9. One protection could be to make many slightly different copies of the neurons that represent foxes. Even if some neurons fall asleep on the job, their copies might still activate. 10. However, if the brain used so many neurons for every single image, we would quickly run out of neurons! 11. This results in an evolutionary pressure: it’s good to have many neurons do very different jobs so we can recognize lots of objects in images, but it’s also good if they share some responsibilities, so they can pick up the slack when necessary. 12. We found evidence for this by investigating the main dimensions of variation in the responses of 10,000 neurons. Below, each column is one neuron’s responses to several of our images. https://t.co/UZqDjTaKv4 13. The largest two dimensions were distributed broadly across all neurons, as you see below. Any neuron could contribute to these and pick up the slack if the other neurons did not respond. https://t.co/AtES0KSNR1 14. The next 8 dimensions each were smaller and distributed more sparsely across neurons. If a neuron was asleep, it was still likely a few others could represent these dimensions in its place. https://t.co/7Dqnes6lUQ 15. The next 30 dimensions revealed ever more intricate structure... https://t.co/v8dZtUJgbp 16. And so did the next 160 dimensions... https://t.co/rlEpkoOIMi 17. And so on, this kept on going, with the N-th dimension being about N times smaller than the biggest dimension. 18. This distribution of activity is called a “power-law”. https://t.co/IiWTda0nwI 19. However, this was not just any power-law, it had a special exponent of approx 1. We did some math and showed that a power-law with this exponent must be borderline fractal. 20. A fractal is a mathematical object that has structure at many different spatial scales, like the Mandelbrot set below: https://t.co/WTARMWiym4 21. This Inceptionism movie is also a kind of fractal: https://t.co/icQEakUayT 22. The neural activity was so close to being a fractal, and just barely avoided it because it’s exponent was 1.04, not 1 or smaller. 23. An exponent of 1.04 is the sweet spot: as high-dimensional as possible without being a fractal. 24. Not being a fractal allows neural responses to be continuous and smooth, which are the minimal protections neurons need so that we don’t confuse a fox with a puffer fish!

It starts on the 31st March when a certain #StarCitizen \"Blue Haired\" Streamer contacts me! PT1 In the conversation he tells me he might have to give up his K9 named \"Chewie\" a lovely Female German Shepard. I had met this Individual and \"Chewie\" in the past when he was working for JRDF. PT2 I went along to their base of Operations in Scotland to give a free Consultation to this Individual as I am a K9 Behavior Specialist so I knew of this K9 well enough to talk more about his problems he was dealing with. In our convo he told me his plans to move back to Wales! PT3 He had moved back from Scotland and his plans had all failed on him, no where to live, no where to look after \"Chewie\". I instantly sent him £200 to his paypal via his Streams Donation page. I told him this was not to be repaid and to make sure he gets himself kept safe! PT4 As he had not been paid yet I wanted to make sure he was safe as I had a good relationship with him from Streaming. I had said to him if he needed me to watch \"Chewie\" I would come for her to make sure he was less stressed out as one could be in this situation. PT5 He then contacted me on the 7th April. He asked if I could watch \"Chewie\" for him. I instantly said yes. I do a lot of K9s it's my job end of the day. As we talked it would work out I would be driving 18+ hours to collect her. I asked if half way by train was a option. PT6 He agreed and I sent him the Train Fare of £200 along with another £300 to live. Plan meet in Glasgow (Scotland) it was going to be still a 8 hour trip for me. We met and was taken to my Car. We then headed back North with my two Wolves. She was very stressed and so was a I. PT7 I had taken time off Streaming to do this for him. I then took off the next day of Streaming to start the training process. I mean if she was going to be staying with me, might as well give her a full course of Training for nothing right? She started off well. PT8 I contacted him to find out Vet Details as I was offering to have her have K9 MOT and get fully boosters at my Local Vet. I never got a reply to the details, so she never got these needed boosters. Which I found strange but as she isn't my K9 I never pushed for the info. PT9 She was also very skinny so I started bulking her up to bring her back into normal weight area of a K9. I got her a special feeding bowl and explained what I was doing but I never got any hint that 2FUCKS were being given. No questions no asking about the K9 at all. PT10 She was very poorly trained and I was noticing some special need symptoms. We went to work with her but sadly she managed to get her self on the bad side of my two Wolves. This was the start of some major problems. I was having to do double work. PT11 Double work? It was meaning I had to walk 4x a day as they couldn't be beside each other. Meant double training to do as I keep training my two. So I started to feel this Physically and Mentally. I was also doing fitness to lose weight a personal goal of mine and Streaming. PT12 I was also having to deal with having the Garden done and having a K9 (Mothers Dog) going through a serious operation so the timing was all wrong. Not his fault just adding this in to show everything from the get go was stressful on our side! PT13 I contacted him saying I was giving him a Cut Off time of the 19th May another 4 weeks from this point. I'm already stressed but nothing compared to being Homeless and Jobless. So I pushed on. I kept updating him but still ZEROFUCKS given. Never any MSGs asking how she was. PT14 We are now at the 6th of May and I made a Phone Call to him to make sure he was prepped to come Collect her from me, was even going to offer I would drive her some distance to make it easier. NOTHING no reply, no phone back, zero answering so at this stage my heart sank! PT15 This point I talked around to see if people had spoken to him, they did. That's when I went FUCK I am going to be landed with this K9. So the past two weeks I have been really ill with Stress. Streaming, Physically &amp; Mentally tired but kept pushing forward for the K9. PT16 Well the 19th came, no collection, no phone call, never answering me via Phone/SMS/Discord, nothing... and this brings us to the WORST feeling I have had to deal with today. PT17 So as someone who loves and works with K9s going to this next place is a heart breaking thing for me. Never have I had to go there, I don't like people taking animals to these places as there is always a way out of it. So today I had to take \"Chewie\" to a Rescue home! PT18 I am a older man, I don't cry at most things, people dying, animals dying and so forth. But I have been very emotional for the past few hours as I have never heard anything so horrible as \"Chewie\" Screaming like \"Help Me, Michael\" when they took her from me. PT19 If it wasn't for the fact she never got on with my two Wolves I would have gladly adopted her. But feeding 4 dogs, boosters and all is too much for me right now. As I am purely Streaming right now, I have no income, everything I do earn goes back into the Stream! My choice. PT20 I'm not looking for money back, I'm not looking for the time back. However I'm deeply disappointed in how someone like this could not only treat their Dog to abandoning it but how he has treated me when all I did was try to help him! I'm deeply broken today! PT21 Now why am I posting this on Twitter? Well firstly I wanted people to know my side of the story, I have not included names or linking people because well you can work it out for yourself. My story is written, it's a good life lesson that some humans still prove TRASH to me! PT22 Now I am not saying unfollow, unsub this Individual, your old enough to make your own mind up. But just THINK before you support this person! If someone can abandon their K9, they will fuck you over for less. I have unfriended this person! PT23 I could never forgive this kind of behavior. It's childish, its a cowardly way because all it would take was to talk to me and we could have sorted it like Adults. I'm sorry for the Rant Tweets but again I had to get this off my chest and vent! P24 I won't be talking to anyone today, not in the mood, an emotional wreck right now. I will however be trying to Stream on Tues but will let you all know if I need to cancel. Thank you for reading this, REPLY/RT if you want, forgive me if I don't reply back.

But if you file your report too soon, you run the risk of not having all the relevant facts and you may include information that hasn't been adequately vetted. https://t.co/OiNbEYrMy2 8) If you take too long to file a report, the news cycle may move on and no one will care about your story. https://t.co/SPNCCw6Fat 9) For many citizen journalists, the sweet spot lies between having the first report, which is often lacking in detail, and the last report, which has less relevance due to saturation of the news cycle. https://t.co/H23B2MDacB 10) I'm usually one of the last people to report on new Q drops because of the time I take to do research. 11) Normally, that would make me one of the least relevant Q reporters but people wait for my reports because I provide insights that others don't. 12) I try to avoid sensationalism and unnecessary speculation. Sometimes rabbit holes can provide helpful background information but there are a million of them out there and not all are worth exploring. Some are nothing but distractions. https://t.co/QwL7VJLrZR 13) I try as much s possible to get my information from reputable sources. But sometimes that isn't possible. When a questionable source is cited, it's a good idea to tell people that so they know they should take the information with a grain of salt. https://t.co/GG89tYCYSA 14) The most difficult barrier for the citizen journalist to overcome is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias drives us to look for and trust any report that confirms what we already believe. Even when that report is biased, poorly sourced or an outright lie. https://t.co/fxSOn0eB0B 15) Confirmation bias gives more weight to our feelings than facts. It encourages us to report things incorrectly—in the light of what our emotions say rather than what the facts say. https://t.co/DXTLz0xBuC 16) This morning, I was inundated with private messages reporting on the supposed indictment of Hillary Clinton. Someone did a YouTube video claiming to prove the indictment had already happened. The problem is that the document in question is fake. https://t.co/OXSHDryYHn 17) Just like the other documents claiming that famous people have been indicted. YouTuber scammers have made a lot of money pushing these false claims on gullible people. https://t.co/mnPFAanvRU 18) YouTubers looking to make money don't care about integrity, fairness, objectivity or truth. They'll say whatever they need to say to make money. They're not citizen journalists and they should not be taken seriously. 19) If you consider yourself to be a citizen journalist, you'll need to decide what path you're going to take. The path of sensationalism, clicks and half-truths ... Or the path of journalistic integrity. 20) A few words to fellow Q researchers: 21) I've always enjoyed sharing other people's content on my page. I appreciate the work of others and I know my followers like seeing their unique perspectives. 22) There are some good researchers in the Q movement. But I'm responsible for the content on my timeline. I can't in good conscience share information that I know is untrue or which has not been adequately researched. 23) I would share more work from fellow Q researchers were it not for the fact that some (who are strong researchers) post things claiming them to be true that Q has debunked. (Confirmation bias seems to be preventing some researchers from accepting these things as truth.) 24) I will gladly share more posts from fellow Q researchers if the work is presented more objectively, with less sensationalism and a higher level of journalistic integrity. 25) We are the replacement of the Fake News media. But until and unless we hold ourselves to a higher standard than their reporters hold themselves to, we'll never be taken seriously. If we refuse to report the facts objectively, like them, we are nothing more than fake news. https://t.co/sklZBlzH4s","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"83932539"},"id_str":"83932539","name":"Praying Medic","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"186933"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"64968"},"created_at":"Tue Oct 20 21:44:51 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"47011"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"8258"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"27728"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"330"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1109"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.90692"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

Knowing Trump’s path to the presidency may provide much needed prologue for what is going to happen with the circle of filth and other pressing issues. President Trump didn’t wake up one morning and decide to run. He has planned his ascent to presidency for a long time. 2. He does nothing without knowing its eventual consequences, regardless of how it may look on the outside. The first recorded “presidential speech” given by Trump occurred on October 22 1987. Yes its not a typo. https://t.co/Q2SPgT8UF2 3. His speech was remarkably similar to what currently says, on that day he said: “I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across.'' 4. He was tired of the United States being kicked around by allies like Japan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. These countries had become ''the world's greatest money machines'' because the United States paid for their defense. He was 41 years old then https://t.co/rDL3GllYho 5. On Oct 7, 1999 edition of Larry King Live Trump announced announced creation of a presidential exploratory committee. Jesse Ventura persuaded Trump to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party. Trump eventually dropped out, citing party's inability to unite. 6. He called Pat Buchanan, another reform party candidate a “Hitler-Lover” in response to Pat’s contention that Hilter presented no serious threat to the United States in WW 2. https://t.co/PaJaHgvCyh 7. On Jan 1 2000 he released his book “ the America we deserve” he said “I really am convinced we're in danger of sort of terrorist attacks that will make 1993 bombing of WTO look like kids playing with firecrackers\" 8.\"A liberal policy of immigration may reflect confidence and generosity. But our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.” 9. February 14, 2000, Trump withdrew from race citing infighting in Reform Party knowing he couldn't win both because of its direction and membership, including David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani who he described as Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively. 10. Trump wrote an editorial in NYT entitled “What I saw at the revolution”, he wrote: “I seriously thought that America might be ready for a businessman president, someone with an eye for the bottom line, someone who has created thousands of jobs” 11. \"I felt confident that I could sell the American people if I could get into the debate I preferred race against Bush and Gore, two establishment politicians whose nominations looked certain and whose issue positions seemed virtually indistinguishable” 12. I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep” “I Saw VP Gore trudging through the snow in subzero temperatures, knocking on doors in New Hampshire, a look of drudgery on his face. 13. My experience was quite different. I had enormous fun thinking about a presidential candidacy and count it as one of my great life experiences.” “I cannot rule out another bid for the presidency in 2004.” https://t.co/Z9DWm34VB4 14. In 2003 Trump began hosting The Apprentice, he thought about a presidential run in 2004, decided not to join the race. During 2012 presidential race, he once again considered running. Few polls even put Trump in second place in the GOP presidential field, behind Mitt Romney. 14. He decided not to run saying “I maintain strong conviction that if I were to run, I would be able to win the primary and general election” \"I have spent the past several months unofficially campaigning and recognize that running for public office cannot be done half-heartedly 16. Ultimately, however, business is my greatest passion and I am not ready to leave the private sector” https://t.co/MrE4nTRRG5 17. Most people took these statements as Trump only promoting himself. In retrospect, he did exactly what he said he would, matter of factly, but with Trump braggadocio. Without the benefit of his past, most people discount Trump as too undisciplined and prone to verbal outbursts 18. Not many predicted that Trump would ever be the president: however one curious thing did happen. The Band “Rage agains the machine” in their 2000 video “Sleep now in the fire” show a person holding up a Trump president poster. Go to 1:03 https://t.co/P0R3CK165E 19. Trump did predict that Brexit would happen https://t.co/RV9UAW1V8i 20.

Trump does everything with a keen eye on results. His methods are unorthodox, making them difficult to follow or interpret. It is also why people underestimate his abilities. Being underestimated is a superpower very few can lay claim to. 22. For those now entertaining doubts about what the future is going to bring, read carefully. I hope that a picture emerges of a man who's always sculpted his future carefully, deliberately &amp; with little regard to what others think about him. Watch his roast on Comedy Central. 23. I also like to point out that Trump occasionally will tweet plain and pure facts. Sometimes these facts can seem fantastical in the present but matter of fact when viewed through the benefit of hindsight. I think this is one such example. -Fin https://t.co/x1osVasC8f 24. PS: Trumps life and career have included The Who's who of Media, Hollywood, Real estate &amp; politics. He not only survived, he thrived in this constantly swirling toilet of depravity &amp; turpitude. He knows how to put pressure on everyones \"trigger points\" https://t.co/Hgja2eaPwM 25. If you remember my previous thread: I had predicted that this would happen and that the lobotomized Hansel and Gretel of US politics would push for a DACA fix. Well that is exactly what is happening.

Himpathy, forwarded by the philosopher Kate Manne, is either completely wrong or partially correct but poorly named and misleading. 2. Himpathy is the hypothesis that either (1) people generally sympathize with men more than women (hence the name), or (2) people generally sympathize with *powerful* men more than low status women (or \"their low status victims\"). 3. Version 1 of the hypothesis, one that I often see people forward, is almost certainly false. So, let's focus on that version before moving to version 2. First, it contradicts everyday experience. Women much more than men are used as victims PRECISELY because we sympathize. 4. In movies, harm to women is used to illustrate that somebody is truly heinous. The saying \"women and children first,\" although not always practiced, certainly suggests more concern for potential women victims. Our reluctance to allow women into battle, the same. 5. Furthermore, a priori evolutionary logic suggests that society would sympathize more with female victims than male victims (of equal status). I can't go through all of sexual selection theory here, but the important thing is this: Females have the more \"valuable\" sex cell. 6. Think of extreme case. One group with 100 women and 25 men. The men could get all the women pregnant. The reverse, though, 100 men and 25 women, would be a reproductive problem for a social group, and a recipe for coalitional collapse. 7. Men's sex cells are cheap; therefore, men are more disposable, especially low status men. This is why men have almost always been forced to die more often than women (in war, in dangerous jobs, et cetera). https://t.co/JtzD9AzlH5 8. Research supports this. Women are seen as more sympathetic victims. People want to punish male perpetrators more harshly. People believe women victims will experience more pain. And people support policies that help only women more than those that help only men. 9. To my knowledge, Manne's only real response to this is to point to studies that show that people believe that men (boys) experience more pain than women (e.g., https://t.co/SYnLCdcPyI). However, as @ImHardcory and others have noted, there is a rather obvious explanation. 10. People believe that boys/men are more tolerant of pain and are more likely to suppress expressions of pain. Indeed, in the study cited by the WaPo, the effect disappeared when researchers controlled for perceptions of \"stoicism.\" 11. Think of an obvious analogy. If shown a film of an adult and a child getting pricked and displaying the same expression, most viewers would believe the adult is experiencing MORE pain. Why? Because adults generally react more stoically to pain. 12. Of course, nobody would print moralistic headlines \"Americans take adults' pain more seriously than children's!\" And nobody would contend this supported a theory that people sympathize more with adult victims than with children victims. 13. Hypothesis version 1, therefore, seems completely untenable to me. In fact, I think observation, theory, and evidence all suggest that it is exactly the opposite of the truth; and likely it would be ignored if not ideologically useful. 14. Version 2, however, is a bit more plausible, if stripped of its sex-based formulation so that it reads, \"People value high status people more than low status people; and they sometimes let high status people get away with heinous crimes if the victims are low status people.\" 15. Of course, this ruins \"himpathy\" and makes the \"sympathy\" not a manifestation of the background misogyny of society, but rather of a natural propensity to favor high status people over others. In fact, the effect is almost certainly stronger if the victims are men, not women 16. In an interview with Vox, Manne forwarded two examples that support the notion that society is \"pathologically\" sympathetic to powerful men: The Kavanaugh hearings and Brock Turner. Yes, you read that correctly, Brock Turner. But we'll get to that. 17. Manne uses Trump's dismissals of Ford's testimony about Kavanaugh as evidence of himpathy. Ford, according to Manne, was \"totally erased from the discourse.\" https://t.co/wZt6vASsuu 18. Trump is callous and boorish, so unsurprisingly he did not handle the situation well. But (1) Ford testified and many, many people believed her (she was certainly not erased); and (2) attitudes about Kavanaugh were largely partisan, so this example is not useful. 19. The Brock Turner example was shocking to me since he is nearly universally reviled. Here is what Manne said, \"And what we saw, from his father and his friends, was this wave of sympathy over what the whole ordeal was costing him.\" 20. This is called kin-selection and tribalism, not himpathy. Of course his friends sympathized with him. And they would have if he were a woman as well. I'm sure many family members have sympathized with ruthless, cold-blooded women. How does the rest of society feel? 21. So far as I can tell, very few people sympathized with him. He is generally depicted as a spoiled, privileged asshole who got a lucky break from an asshole judge. And many were outraged at his lenient sentence. Judge for yourself. Do a Google search. 22. Now, ask yourself this: If I used an example this ludicrous to support a theory that Vox and other progressives disagreed with, would they ever let it pass? Is there any evidence that most normal Americans experienced a wave of sympathy for Brock Turner?? 23. What is true, however, is that HIGH STATUS PEOPLE probably do and have for a long time received preferential treatment. In many ancient law codes, including Anglo-Saxon and Roman among others, high status people were explicitly treated differently from low status people. 24. Although our law codes discarded this preferential treatment, it stems from a natural human propensity to admire and defer to high status people. So, in this very circumscribed sense, Manne's hypothesis is probably 60% true. BUT, it's not about sex. 25. It's about status. It's not himpathy. It's hierarchy. And, my guess is that there would be an interaction such that a female victim would increase not decrease our hatred of a powerful perpetrator and increase not decrease our sympathy for the victim.

This one has to do with the process of #LDL particles entering the arterial wall. So gather round friends and let me science the s*it out of this 🤓 (1/24) https://t.co/62dcEc6pR8 For background, here’s a widely cited series of figures by Nakashima et al. (2007). They performed autopsies on 38 people aged 7-49, who died of non-#cardiovascular causes (2/24) https://t.co/qMSuPNagwC https://t.co/cyiyu6OkYp Nakashima et al. looked for atherosclerotic lesions at different stages, according to a previously published morphological classification scheme. They found them, took slices, stained them to find #lipids and #macrophages and organized them nicely (3/24) (It should be noted that even though the famous figure series now looks like it could depict actual progression of a single plaque, individual figures are obviously from different subjects and different lesions at various stages) (4/24) They present an elegant “time-series” of how lipids first appear in the vessel wall and then progress deeper and deeper eventually pooling into one great big mass. Lipids are followed by macrophages - cells that eat them (5/24) This is a GREAT illustration of the current paradigm of atherogenesis (“response to retention”), meaning that LDL particles enter the arterial wall, get trapped, aggregate &amp; become inflammatory. NOT some other sequence of events: https://t.co/Q1jL20flKf (6/24) So here’s the topic of this tweetorial: according to some, there’s something fishy in this series! Let’s look at the first image. Notice how the lipid stains appear quite far from the inner layer of the wall (endothelium)? OMG HOW DO THEY “JUMP” THERE!? (7/24) https://t.co/MFSyVX01AW Now, if you’re the arrogant type at the peak of #DunningKruger Effect (AKA “Mount Stupid”), you might think “Gotcha!! I read this and now I know better than all the experts in the world! Clearly this disproves 100 years of CVD research!”. And you’d be wrong (8/24) https://t.co/zBd7EsPwwK On the other hand, if you’re a more moderate, critical thinker but a curious person, you might go “Huh, that’s interesting but I’m probably I’m missing something. I’m sure these folks who do this for a living have thought about this”. And then you’d be right! 😊 (9/24) https://t.co/HgioPmjBKO So what is the explanation? Before we get there, let’s take a quick poll: without checking, what do you think is the *scale* of the Nakashima images? (10/24) Now, what do you think is the size scale of #LDL lipoproteins? (11/24) Now that we’re done polling, let’s get back to the paper and take a look at the scale bar in the corner of each fig. It’s 100 MICRO meters. Then, let’s remember that LDL particles are in the 20-30 NANO meter range. There’s a THOUSAND fold difference in scale! (12/24) https://t.co/6RFWwsfEzW So the short answer to the “jump mystery\" is simply image resolution. There ARE indeed #LDL particles in the area just below endothelium but they’re just too small to be seen. If Nakashima et al. had used a microscope with 800x magnification, they might have caught those! (13/24) https://t.co/JLlDjpukCi Think of it this way: essentially the situation is analogous to looking at a satellite image of a city at a scale of individual blocks. At best, the resolution allows you to see large aggregate masses of people but not individual humans (14/24) https://t.co/3gLwZRNo1t Speaking of mass, back to red stuff. The authors are using a stain called Sudan IV, which turns neutral lipids (triglycerides etc) red. The accumulating redness is the build-up and fusion of nm-sized LDL particles to such a degree it starts to show up in micrometer-scale (15/24) https://t.co/xFCOh41711 “But why does it build up like that?” Great question, glad you asked! Aside from the scale bars, we now have to note the little arrows. They indicate something called Internal Elastic Lamina (IEL). It’s right at the border between two layers of the wall (intima and media) (16/24) https://t.co/sEs6HqCXEy For many macromolecules, IEL is an impermeable barrier. It has holes which are small enough for some HDL particles or albumin to squeeze through but LDLs simply don’t fit. This was shown in seminal work already in the 80’s: https://t.co/c80eK3Mzme (17/24) https://t.co/NGCuaytnFQ (BTW, that paper is related to a line of research showing how the concentration of LDL particles in the wall is more than two-fold to their concentration in blood. The wall is a sticky environment to them and that’s why we don’t want them getting there in the first place) (18/24) So the red mass shown by Nakashima is essentially a massive amount of LDL particles hitting a wall and forming one great big pile of lipid that stains red! Any questions? Yes, you in the back (19/24) https://t.co/irK0qBvZ3S “But how can we be sure that there REALLY are individual LDLs in the layer just under the endothelium? Are there any studies that HAVE used a sufficiently big magnification that would reveal them?” Another great question! Answer is: yes (20/24) https://t.co/Ewc6d2cyOd @Salehti et al. have used a 3D electron microscope to study small LDL deposits and cholesterol crystals in human carotid arteries. It’s a very nice paper with heaps of interesting data! https://t.co/v2jZUIdPfQ (21/24) Among others, the paper contains this supplemental figure that clearly shows actual cholesterol CRYSTALS just over 100um from the endothelium (in the Nakashima paper, the red starts to build up around 300-400um) (22/24) https://t.co/njCdWuGQMo So, in conclusion, the people who look at the Nakashima figure and think there’s something dubious about it that scientists haven’t noticed, are missing the scale difference of plaques and lipoproteins. Scientists investigating atherosclerosis are not stupid (23/24) ApoB-containing lipoproteins are travelling in the bloodstream and end up into the arterial walls from there. The more particles, the higher the risk of a build-up over time. That’s what’s shown again and again in multiple lines of evidence that you should believe (24/24) Big thanks to @Salehti for clarifying a few things related to this! Please give her a follow if you’re interested in following an actual expert in lipoprotein infiltration to the arterial wall. /END tweetorial (25/Bonus)","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2538018122"},"id_str":"2538018122","name":"Pauli Ohukainen","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"3305"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"965"},"created_at":"Sat May 31 18:42:57 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"15273"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"51"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"491"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"8"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"20"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.88314"},"all_hashtags":["Tweetorial","cholesterol","atherosclerosis","LDL","cardiovascular","lipids","macrophages","DunningKruger"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

But it does not compete with bitcoin, it reinforces bitcoin's value proposition, and will likely need to rely on bitcoin if it succeeds. Thread👇 Facebook has some 2 billion accounts, and extremely detailed data on them. Its extensive data mining &amp; identity verification capabilities mean it has the potential to build by far the largest platform by user number of any financial institution. To on-board billions, Visa or Paypal need to go through people's banks to verify their identity, which is highly expensive, manual and unscalable. FB tracks your every move &amp; knows you better than you or your mom do. They don't need a bank &amp; can scale much faster. An international transaction on the Visa network has to go through clearance &amp; settlement through many financial institutions and central banks, entailing costs &amp; risks. On Libra, users can transact peer-to-peer through only one institution. The perks of 2b+ users! Libra being backed by national currencies means it is backed by the USD, since all other national currencies at this point are backed by USD and managed by central banks to try to stay stable against the dollar. Other government coins are just dollars + issuer risk. For billions of people, a dollar-backed Libra on your phone globally is infinitely superior to national currency in market depth &amp; maintaining value. If it succeeds, Libra will likely destroy most 3rd world currencies, or force them to be fully pegged to &amp; backed by the US dollar For billions of people, a FB-based payment network will offer more and cheaper transactions than any other KYC/AML platforms. If it succeeds, Libra will likely eat most fiat payment processors like Visa, Paypal, and Western Union, particularly those functioning in the third world Dot not underestimate how powerful and beneficial such a network could be. If access to global finance &amp; the USD were as easy as access to a FB account, billions of people's lives would be improved drastically. Having said that, it's important to remember all of this is far easier said than done. Regulatory approval internationally is the main hurdle to overcome. But given the money, power &amp; influence FB has, they might pull this off. But to be clear, Facebook is building a centralized payment processor on the US dollar and calling it a blockchain. Like all centralized shitcoins, they've set up a 'Foundation' to pretend the thing is independent. They're even pretending its development will be open source. As shitcoins amply demonstrate, these pretenses are far easier to maintain in the whitepaper stage. Good luck to the Libra team keeping your development and blockchain open when people try to use them to send money to Iran. The foundation will remain independent until it tries to do something against FB's wishes. Will FB just allow its billions of users to seamlessly shift to a Libra they don't like? FB users' access to Libra can be turned off by FB, utterly subjugating the foundation to FB's will. The only functional advantage of calling this centralized system a blockchain is arguably in regulation. Easier to get things by regulators by using crypto buzzwords than admitting to just running a bank. Otherwise, everything would be more efficient if centralized. FB's comparative advantage is in processing peer-to-peer payments between its members, not in building the monetary system on which these payments are based. As long as government currencies rule, FB are beholden by their regulators. In search of bribes, political favors, and attention-whoring, every politician worldwide will want to put barriers in the face of Libra. The French are already leading the way: https://t.co/AYwQJcYk4H A global payment network governed by dozens of governments is unworkable in the long run. The 'monetary nationalism' problem Hayek identified in 1930s can't be solved with payment processors, it needs a global free market money free from government control https://t.co/NC1dpXntPG No amount of cryptography, blockchains, or independent foundations will stop you from being politically controlled, unless you are bitcoin, for reasons explained in detail in my book's last chapter: https://t.co/v0r3uJB3XR Further, no amount of appeals to 'decentralization' or 'blockchain' buzzwords will mask the fact that the system will be completely authoritarian, with FB maintaining full surveillance and censorship capabilities. So if it is to succeed, FB has to become the executive arm of the US Government's financial, intelligence &amp; foreign policies. And its decentralized foundation will have to do USG's bidding on everything from monetary policy to banking regulations and sanctions. But by increasing people's financial freedom while remaining politically controlled, Libra would be digging its own grave. All the problems of political money in the 20th century would remain, but people would find it much easier to opt out from than regular govt moneys. There are no armies forcing you to accept Libra, but a world in which everyone has their money on an app is a world in which everyone is a click away from bitcoin. History shows us hard moneys tend to kill easy moneys when the two are exchangeable: https://t.co/v0r3uJB3XR Bitcoin is hard money, it is apolitical, neutral, censorship free, and it can't even spy on you if it wanted to. All of these are things FB can never install on Libra. FB shouldn't think of itself as competing with Bitcoin, as that's how they'll becoming an irrelevant stupid shitcoin like the thousands we have. In the long-run, Bitcoin represents the only chance for FB to build Libra on a global neutral protocol, and not on a political currency So, if govts let it, Libra will likely kill most KYC/AML fiat processors &amp; currencies, producing a global digital payment system based on USD. The problems it'll face then are the same problems faced by any political monetary system, to which bitcoin is the only working solution. In the short-run, Libra will only survive by being subservient to the USD &amp; pegged to it. In the long-run, it will only survive by being subservient to bitcoin and pegged to it. The only other fate possible is the life &amp; inevitable death of yet another irrelevant stupid shitcoin.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"18469669"},"id_str":"18469669","name":"Saifedean Ammous","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"54052"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"301"},"created_at":"Tue Dec 30 04:21:14 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"23076"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1865"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7655"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"75"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"306"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.36"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

There were no pygmy people here. I feel like that's probably a very offensive term but I see this one doing the rounds quite a lot and it's completely false. We are not the \"second Australians\" who usurped the land from pygmies. We didn't arrive here four thousand years ago, or even forty thousand years. Every few years they find earlier and older evidence of our occupation here. Count is currently at 65k, significantly older than any living culture. https://t.co/sbUUeDRwrj Many Aboriginal people, including myself, don't believe in so called \"migration theories\" and believe that we were created here on this land. We have creation songlines which link many different language groups together with shared ancestral beings. Speaking of language - we had a lot of them. Around up to 700 dialects from around 250 different language groups. These languages were and are geographically situated and mob would be familiar with/able to communicate in multiple. https://t.co/82zVMYSNOw There is no cultural/spiritual origin for sexual abuse, cannibalism, or infanticide. 1788 was an invasion. Phillip had orders from King George to avoid causing harm to local Aboriginal people if at all possible, and was instructed to try to negotiate with locals so as to better acquire land and resources. There were multiple military expeditions/raids throughout NSW in the decades following invasion. MacArthur gave instructions to soldiers in 1795 to drive away \"the natives\", ie kill them and clear the land. That's what the term \"dispersed\" means in many colonial records. Aboriginal people did resist invasion and did organise against settlers, attacking farms, stealing back resources, killing settlers etc. The punishment for these actions was typically far harsher from settlers and regularly involved the killing of women and children. Aboriginal people did help settlers on multiple occasions. Sometimes they were rewarded for this with land packets, money, and breast plates. Often enough, as in the case of Galmarra/Jackey Jackey and the Cape York expedition, they rejected these offerings. Disease spread often before settlers. Disease accounts for significant losses even before some communities had ever seen a white person. It is almost certainly true that smallpox was spread willfully through the distribution of infected blankets, as had been done in the US. Missions and reserves were usually terrible and oppressive places for Aboriginal people and many people died of poor sanitation and starvation. Missions = religious control, reserve = welfare/protection board. Aboriginal people typically didn't have freedom of movement. Welfare/protection boards were managed on state authority until 1967 and there was significant inconsistency in policy/practice. Aboriginal people were mostly considered wards of the state under the authority of these boards up until the mid 20th century. Boards had the power to regulate residence, marriage, force unpaid employment, remove children, etc. In late 19thC the movement towards assimilation began and families were separated on the basis of \"blood quantum\", an imprecise science (it wasn't science). Speaking of remains, stolen Aboriginal remains were being passed around in anthropology classes as late as the 1960s. There are no laws for repatriation of Aboriginal remains in Australia. Australia did have a slave trade, commonly referred to as Black Birding https://t.co/goruqoaQZZ In the 20thC after being institutionalised many Aboriginal boys were forced into unpaid manual/station work while girls were forced into unpaid domestic apprenticeships. Protection board knew girls were being raped in these positions but felt it was beneficial for assimilation. Land Rights didn't begin with Mabo, it began with Invasion. There was the handover of land to the Gurindji peoples in 1975 after almost a decade of political organising which preceded Mabo. The 1967 didn't give us the right to vote or to be citizens, those rights came in gradually in the 20thC depending on state, but voting wasn't encouraged or accessible. 67 gave us the right to be counted in the census, and for the federal gov to make laws regarding us. The gov has a bad history in its use of these powers, often operating alongside the repeal of the Racial Discrimination Act in cases such as Hindmarsh Bridge and the NT Intervention. We were never considered flora and fauna. Honestly a lot of the time we had less rights than that. Altho the management of Aboriginal affairs did at one stage come under a flora and fauna portfolio, which is probably where that myth comes from. Aboriginal people have been writing for a long time. First western-recognised form of authorship comes in the form of Bennelong's 1796 letter to Lord Sydney's steward. First written petition for land was in 1832 from Maria Lock. First book from David Unaipon in 1928. This one’s a biggun: YES WE DID HAVE AGRICULTURE! The denial of systems of farming and land cultivation is central to the denial of our rights and sovereignty to the land BUT we totally cultivated the land and still practice things like fire stick farming https://t.co/Hh6KtaAHL7 Terra nullius was never “declared”, it only appeared in legal usage/documentation in the 20th century. The notion that Aboriginal people didn’t sufficiently fulfil western criteria for land possession was certainly around at invasion but it wasn’t formalised as a doctrine Aboriginal is a demonym which means it must be capitalised. The preferred language is humanising - so Aboriginal people vs Aborigines etc. We have over 200ys of being called black and we have reclaimed that language for our use - ie black, blackfellas, Blak (see Destiny Deacon)","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2469916026"},"id_str":"2469916026","name":"evelyn araluen","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"8533"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1708"},"created_at":"Tue Apr 29 22:24:03 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"12499"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"25"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"6679"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"29201"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"267"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1168"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.92875"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184176"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"344"},"texto":"(1) The story of #RubyRidge is nothing but heartbreaking. Let's take a moment to discuss a story the Federal Government would rather be forgotten. A story of a family that only wanted to worship their God, raise their children, and be left alone. https://t.co/fJpOr5160X (2) #StoryTime. Ruby Ridge is an outstretch of mountains in the northernmost part of Idaho, in a county named Boundary, as it rests right along the Canadian border, between the Washington and Montana borders. When someone wants to be left alone, Ruby Ridge is one place they go. https://t.co/tOI7Ey0qz0 (3) One person who wished nothing more than to be left alone was Randy Weaver. Weaver was a devout Christian &amp; US Army vet who had become disillusioned with his government; in the early 1980's, he moved his family to a 20-acre plot of land on Ruby Ridge and built himself a home. https://t.co/hgIuTAYyQG (4) He had no electricity. He had no running water. But he had his family, his faith, and the work of his hands, and with these he created a life for himself. But about ten miles from where Randy chose to build his home was an Aryan Nations compound. (5) Now, there is no evidence to suggest that Randy Weaver or his family harboured any white supremacist thoughts, despite what reports these days would say. But the Aryan Nations people were the only people around, with whom Randy could trade. And on rare occasion, he did. (6) The Aryan Nations compound near Randy's home had been, for a couple years, a target of the FBI. And when Randy showed up, he stuck out like a sore thumb. This made Randy and his family a ripe target for the FBI to use. An undercover informant took advantage of Randy's needs. (7) When the informant learned that Randy was looking for work at the compound, he saw opportunity. So he asked Randy to saw off a couple shotguns. This was entrapment, pure and simple. If Randy made these illegal weapons, the FBI/ATF would be justified to get a warrant. https://t.co/NBVC0LZMMn (8) And they did get their warrant. They must have been thinking, \"If we can arrest this man, we can use him to get to bigger and more dangerous people in the Aryan Nations.\" But that's not what they got. The ATF arrested Randy in July of 1990. (9) The FBI immediately asked Randy to turn State's Witness against the Aryan Nations, and he refused -- not because he held sympathies for white separatists, but because he had once before been lied about and pursued by the government, in 1985. https://t.co/FcU6M2xboo (10) In fact, the Secret Service, ATF, and FBI did nothing to assuage Weaver's distrust of the government. They doubled down on their accusations of him being a white supremacist, a bank robber and wished to kill the president. It was all untrue. And Weaver vehemently denied it. (11) They could not hold Randy for long, and he eventually returned to his home in Ruby Ridge. But in December of 1990, a grand jury dismissed the bank robbery and treason charges, and indicted Weaver on charges of making illegal firearms. (12) By this time, the ATF had built up this image in their mind. They thought of Randy Weaver in the same way we think of terrorists today: bunkered down with thousands of bullets at their disposal. \"We can't just walk up to his house and arrest him,\" they convinced themselves. (13) So instead, they waited. They knew Randy Weaver wouldn't show up for his trial, and when he inevitably didn't, they gained the help of the Marshals Service. Surveillance was set up all around the Weaver home. Snipers took up position at all angles. They watched and waited. (14) When the Marshals were brought in on the case, they had not been informed of WHY Randy Weaver was being sought. No one told them about the shotguns. No one told them about the attempts to solicit a State's Witness. All they knew was this man was evading the law. https://t.co/3Zew363gIi (15) There were three units. Two surveillance units set up a good distance away with sniper rifles, spotting and surveillance equipment, and one ground unit which happened to be trespassing on the Weaver property by a good distance. And Randy's dog could smell them. (16) Randy's dog went after the ground unit. Very little information is known about what happened during the early stages, but what is known is that shots were fired by both sides, starting with the Marshals shooting Randy's dog. And then Randy's son, Sammy Weaver. https://t.co/Qr8kdCrdGK (17) These were people of the forest. They didn't get their food from the grocery store; they hunted and grew their food right there around their property. Every one of the Weavers was handy with a gun. And they fought back. US Marshal William Degan was shot &amp; killed. (18) This drove the federal officers into a frenzy. Suddenly, dozens of FBI, ATF, and US Marshal units are being deployed in this remote mountain forest in northern Idaho. They're ready to get revenge for their fallen brother in arms. They think this is another Robert Matthews. (19) And because they think this is another Robert Matthews, they decide that a surrender order does not need to be given. Instead, the federal officers are told they can open fire as soon as they see any armed adult. But the Weavers are hunters. They're always armed. (20) The federal agents were prepared for war. Roadblocks were set up. Helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, humvees were brought out in an overwhelming display of force. And on the morning of August 22, 1992, all the Weavers wanted to do was see the body of their son. (21) They head to the shed where Sammy's body had been stored, and they take with them their weapons. A shot rings out. CRACKKK. Randy is hit in the shoulder. They run back to the house. CRACKKKK. Another shot goes right through Vicki Weaver's face. https://t.co/InFlSnItQn (22) Word came down the mountain quickly after Vicki's death. Neighbors, friends of the Weavers, supporters, news crews had gathered down at the road up to Ruby Ridge, and her death drove them to riot. Their worst fears had come true. A tyrannical force was killing Americans. https://t.co/Qbb1psJZe0 (23) Again, the history is skewed. People like to say that the roadblock was filled with skinheads and racists -- but they were a tiny minority. Most were just proud Americans, like you see in the picture above. Of 200-300 people, maybe 10 people were from the Aryan Nations. (24) After 11 days of stand-off, Randy Weaver eventually surrendered to the FBI. He was terribly wounded from the bullet in his shoulder. It could have been avoided at so many points. The entrapment. The falsifying of charges. Shooting the dog. Foregoing the surrender order. https://t.co/WrjNKR0zHH (25) But even now, more than 25 years later, the government cannot be honest about its failures at Ruby Ridge. \"They were white separatists,\" they say. \"It wasn't our fault,\" they tell themselves. The history is tweaked to give the government excuse. But we know better. (26) All the Weavers wanted was to be left alone. And because of that, the government grew suspicious of them. Lied about them. Used entrapment to try and use them. The scariest words in the English language really are, \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\" https://t.co/QNRL8fEPAj","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"712744488"},"id_str":"712744488","name":"sevvie 🈲","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"1352"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"856"},"created_at":"Mon Jul 23 17:00:36 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"37712"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"26"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"47"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"167"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"2"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"6"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.79616"},"all_hashtags":["RubyRidge","StoryTime"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

I jumped in my seat and thought: “again?” But it was not another fire alarm. I knew that when Mr. Porter went over the com to tell us to evacuate the building. I grabbed my stuff and was one of the first ones out. When I lead the way towards the 1200 building I stopped in front of the courtyard. There was a man there. Someone I didn’t recognize. He was holding a gun. He turned around and looked at us. I’m glad I wasn’t wearing my glasses. Im glad I didn’t have to see his non-blurred face. I don’t remember what happened quite right.

Go back to the classroom!” I remember the culinary teacher saying “Code red: this is not a drill get in my classroom.” I remember the panic attack Next thing I remember is bing given water then being restrained for the third time from leaving the room.

What did Harper do? The list is very long. Destroyed science libraries, chose to visit pandas instead of meeting with First Nation's youth who had WALKED to Ottawa to meet with him... 11/25 Cut Veteran's services, cut Status of Women's offices, shut off acceptance of refugees, ignored MMIWG, removed protection from our lakes and waterways, sent our young men and women into a war zone that was not our war... 12/25 Prorogued parliament several times to save his own a$$. Tried to vilify the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Cut off media access. Only held town hall meetings that allowed vetted CPC supporters... 13/25 Fired and vilified whistle-blowers like Linda Keen and Richard Colvin. Was the only PM in Commonwealth history to be found in contempt of parliament. Wasted our money on Economic Action Plan billboards and ads... 14/25 Not to mention ads bought in Eastern Europe to tell Roma people they were not welcome in Canada. And ads in the US to promote the CPC and the pipelines. 15/25 He locked himself in a bathroom in a fit of pique while on an international trip. He had an unprecedented number of secret orders-in-council (25+) enacted, 8 during his last year in power. https://t.co/daJYic75h5 16/25 He brought in draconian and unconstitutional sentencing laws that have been shown in other jurisdictions to be completely ineffective in making communities safer. Apparently to satisfy a primal urge for vengeance among his base. 17/25 He brought in boutique tax credits to pander to people who already had money and ignored those who didn't. He brought in a taxable child benefit. He suggested a \"barbaric cultural practices tip-line\" \"Hey Old Stock Canadians!

They want US gun laws and US nukes on our land. They cheat in elections. They show no regard for the environment. They pander to their base and their donors. No one else matters. 23/25 If you can know all this and still say you vote CPC because you are only fiscally conservative, you are saying one of two things. Hint: neither reflects well on you. 24/25 You are either saying you actually are a racist/homophobe/misogynist and it just makes you mad when other people know it, or you care more about money than people. There's no way around that. That's really sad. 25/25 Essentially, in case I did not make it clear earlier. if you vote CPC you are complicit. You don't get to cherry-pick parts of a platform.

She never got an answer. https://t.co/8fCqtaplnf 5A) Rudy Giuliani asserted that #Mueller's team had told him they will not indict Trump while he is president. https://t.co/F88UWlYYp8 5B) This is not surprising because #Mueller is subject to DOJ rules &amp; they provide that a sitting president cannot be indicted. However, it does suggest Mueller has moved beyond \"was a crime committed?\" to \"can I indict Trump?\" https://t.co/7wgNwkrAOC 6A) The former head of Qatar's Investment Authority, Ahmed al Rumaihi, (who attended a 12/12/16 Trump Tower meeting) said Michael Cohen asked him for a $1 million payment for access to administration/infrastructure projects. https://t.co/IKu9RXK3oC 6B) This is the same al-Ramaihi who is said in a sworn court affidavit in the \"Ice Cube\" lawsuit to have told a Bannon friend that Qatar wanted to offer funding to Bannon after the WH fired him, &amp; when rebuffed, offered that Flynn had taken Qatar's money. https://t.co/UAO9huaKk1 7A) Trump filed his annual financial disclosure, and it disclosed the loan from Michael Cohen (now repaid) to fund the $130k #StormyDaniels payment. Trump had previously denied knowledge of the payment, both directly &amp; via his attorneys. https://t.co/drc7P2qLJh 7B) @OfficeGovEthics referred the #StormyDaniels payment matter to #Mueller as potentially relating to one of his investigations. The filing should have been made last year and various disclosure/FEC laws were likely broken. https://t.co/rCeJDJaJmC 8A) It was reported that #Mueller has subpoenaed Roger Stone's social media consultant, Jason Sullivan, who worked on the Trump campaign. https://t.co/IY8JWuUnrL 8B) #Mueller's subpoena of Sullivan suggests Stone may be a target of his investigation and that Mueller is looking into his possible coordination with Wikileaks and/or hackers. https://t.co/iiD2b8Vc8i 9A) @nytimes had a major story assessing what was going on at the FBI during the months before the election, and how it affected the Times' coverage. https://t.co/n3sd6po3rc 9B) The FBI assumed HRC would win &amp; was paranoid that Trump would paint it as partisan. Thus, the FBI threw cold water on the story a week before the election, resulting in the headline \"Investigating Donald Trump, FBI finds no clear link to Russia.\" https://t.co/dzqEcui2MT 10A) @chrisinsilico, the #CambridgeAnalytica whistleblower, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/2U6f4fLvHb 10B) Wylie testified that Steve Bannon was extremely interested in using psychographic data to suppress voting, especially among minorities more likely to vote for Democrats. https://t.co/GsBhP7Sawj 11A) Michael Cohen was working on a Trump Tower Moscow deal until very close to Trump's nomination. https://t.co/rUVVZMTJhe 11B) Cohen previously claimed the Trump Moscow Tower project was dropped in January 2016, but texts &amp; emails between Cohen and Felix Sater show it continued into the 2nd half of 2016. Trump at the time was claiming he had no ties to Russia. https://t.co/C61Y9cVg7u 12) So now you're caught up on the double digit #TrumpRussia developments from Wed. Next question is, \"What can YOU do to help?\" Step 1 - Sign up at https://t.co/U6JcNSOxpL for 'rapid response.' Volume of sign-ups (now 350k+) is a deterrent to Trump crossing our red lines. https://t.co/WJnrgE7vjB 13) Step 2 - Call your senators &amp; express your concerns. Say you've been following the news &amp; demand they push for a floor vote to #ProtectMueller &amp; #ProtectRosenstein. Less than 6 months to midterms. We've got this.

Her answer is to prevent billionaires. Ostensibly. HER OWN PARTY would be the billionaires. The rest of us would have ringworm.\" https://t.co/mC4vgq3vR6 \"I was pissed off when the GOP lost the House, but then I heard Trump say that he was now in a better position. What he meant was that he could be as ruthless as necessary, without having to hold Paul Ryan's hand.\" \"McConnell is on board. He's like Trump in that he's hiding his real actions behind a facade. But let's look at the first two years of the Trump administration.\" Everything the DOJ and FBI did is now known. Trump had multiple double agents. NATO is stronger than ever, because Trump forced our \"allies\" to pony up. The most dangerous country in the world--North Korea--is on its way to becoming a REAL ally of the US. China is being forced to play by the rules. The southern border of the US is being secured. And legal action is being taken against the press and politicians who try to get people killed When Trump said it would take him two years to get going, he meant that he had to wait until the GOP lost the House, and the main offenders in the Obama FBI and DOJ were fired. The most ruthless man I ever knew was my father--until he hit his seventies. Then he became such a pushover that my brother and I had to essentially guard him from predators. Trump in his seventies is MORE RUTHLESS NOW than he was when he was a young man. Good. I've haven't said this in a while, but Trump EARNED my support. With actions. There are times when he fools me, but THAt'S GOOD. If I could figure everything out beforehand, the plans wouldn't be good. The point is that I trust the Trump, even when I don't know what he's doing. I trust him so much that I don't even think about the job he's doing. I've DELEGATED the presidency to Trump. This frees me up to look at other things. Trump just promised that the fake-news media will be gone six years from now. Take THAT promise to the bank. The Judas goats are making sure that the Democratic nominee for 2020 will be a Stalinist anarchist. https://t.co/FVYwryNuS3 In other words, a pathetic clown whose positions can't be reconciled. Most billionaires are leftist, so when AOC demands their abolition, she's lying. She's already proven herself stupid and corrupt. Just the other day, I saw Joe Scarborough promise that AOC was \"coming after Trump.\" These people are *mentally challenged*. All of them. [note: Thomas is posting this on Quod Verum. If I use the word he used here on Twitter, it's a banned word, my account would be locked] It's a good word that was wrongfully stigmatized. \"[*mentally challenged*]\" means limited. To r____rd an engine means to hinder the driving force. Too many words have been deemed offensive. Let me give you my favorite example: I was talking to a car-guy, and he said this: \"I blew a tranny on the freeway last night.\" I said, \"Were you driving or parked on the shoulder?\" He frowned and then burst into hysterical laughter. \"I never once in my life thought of it that way,\" he said. See, I'm not a car-guy, so I had never heard the phrase \"blew a tranny,\" even though I figured it out. [Armageddon: \"Blew the tranny....blew the tranny....!\" ] https://t.co/1sSg5YSn8M The previous toot would've earned me a suspension on Twitter. But Twitter is already mortally wounded. Can't you feel it? The Jussie Smollet fiasco was almost certainly the result of people whispering in the ears of the easily manipulated. Jussie is STILL claiming that the MAGAttack actually happened. He went sobbing to his cast mates and begged them to believe him. He's the beginning of the Great Collapse. His pratfall will be repeated endlessly. Lincoln was told to fire General Ulysses S. Grant because Grant was a drunk. \"I can't spare this man,\" Lincoln said. \"He's a fighter.\" Grant fought his greatest battle after the war. Diagnosed with terminal throat cancer, he was broke and hopeless. Mark Twain intervened. \"Write your memoirs,\" Twain told Grant. \"For your family.\" So Grant wrote his memoirs in longhand. He was so physically weak that he could move only his hands. He had to be propped up. But he sat and wrote until the book was finished. And then he died. https://t.co/8NCO5WoL6F We forgot how to be a great people, but we're relearning. At the end of Trump's second term, we won't even recognize the place. All will be well. END.

Let's dispense with one of the big ones: the idea that they can't be camps because the conditions inside are fine. That's a lie. People are dying. You need cattle cars to fit your definition? How about this IG report from May that found detainees are packed so tightly into rooms that they have to stand on toilets to breathe. One cell with a capacity of 8 held 41 detainees. A cell built for 35 held 155. https://t.co/Tr2q9fT1Rq And these aren't temporary conditions. People are being kept in conditions where they can't sit down for WEEKS. Full report here: https://t.co/SW9q5iBwjT https://t.co/tW7oQXr4dJ Thousands are being tortured in solitary confinement. A man from Nicaragua was kept in solitary for two months b/c he had a bad leg (?!?!). Inside, people are going crazy, cutting their wrists and gouging out their eyes. The folks at @simonwiesenthal might recognize that theme. https://t.co/8UGpMCyART \"But at least they get free healthcare, right?\" Nope. Trump doesn't give free healthcare to you, why would he take care of people he doesn't consider human? As @kenklippenstein found, ICE is letting detainees die. https://t.co/8lWrKf2Q4q Some of you may remember the 37 children who were confined to vans for up to 39 hours in the parking lot of a detention center outside Port Isabel, Texas -- after being ripped from their parents' arms. The government tried covering that up for a while. https://t.co/EwGZS2GHZI \"OK, but how about Obama? He was bad to lots of immigrants. Why didn't you criticize him?\" I did! But things are considerably different under Trump. For instance, children are dying in ICE and CBP custody. They weren't before. https://t.co/AURN3zSSbE It's hard to keep track of the numbers but according to this @NBCNews story at least 24 people have died in Trump's camps so far, not counting the kids. So 29? Or 31? The number keeps rising. https://t.co/MjUCNfxSzl But we don't know how much deaths are rising, because officials have stopped reporting it! They don't want us to know what's going on behind the barbed wire. Which, as I've said, is one of the major purposes of a concentration camp. https://t.co/d4YNK8nDmP A lot of people have been telling me that the housing in the concentration camps is so wonderful, homeless people want to move to them. Here's what they can look forward to if they go: Being tortured through sleep deprivation in a freezing-cold room until they shit themselves. https://t.co/qg6wiEROx8 After they're done enjoying that, they can have a nice rest in a dog kennel. https://t.co/iSRjK9BzhC Also they can learn the luxury art of parceling out a single bologna sandwich for three people over two days! And remember: This is being done to terrify and torture people exercising their legal right to asylum, to convince them to go home and die. Your tax dollars at work. https://t.co/z2aHTiC7Gw Those details are from this piece, which I suggest reading before you decide to move to Dilley or one of the other concentration camps, which are basically all-inclusive resorts except for the constant torture and harassment. https://t.co/09M8wazk38 And of course, this all needs context. It isn't some slapdash solution to a real immigration problem. It's the policy of an authoritarian president who rode to power promising to punish immigrants for existing. And he said he wouldn't stop there. https://t.co/h7kMxPEX3b Didn't know any of this before today? That's what the camps are for. They're to concentrate undesirables away from you so you don't know what's happening to them. Thanks to @AOC's use of the term today, you've been forced to pay attention.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818417c"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"350"},"texto":"1. I want to talk about ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 13-years-old. To say it's misunderstood (both by people who have ADHD and people who don't have it) is an understatement. What people need to understand about those of us who have ADHD is we are not homogeneous 2. Because many people think those with ADHD all have similar symptoms and challenges, we don't often get the empathy and support we need. ADHD is something we live with every day, hour, minute. It can ravage our lives and you may not even be aware of it. 3. When people have asked me in the past to describe what ADHD feels like I get into details about how it impacts my life every day but I always add that for me that ADHD has caused me a great deal of emotional pain. It's a frustrating, infuriating disorder. 4. I want to be clear, I don't speak for everyone with ADHD but I have spoken to enough people over the last two years with ADHD that I feel comfortable speaking about it publicly. 5. People who don't have ADHD often oversimplify what it means to have ADHD. I don't blame them, they're not living with ADHD. But that's one of the reasons ADHD is so misunderstood because it's anything but simple. That's why it's so hurtful when people jokingly say \"squirrel\" 6. Whenever someone brings up ADHD. It makes it seem like it's is just an issue of distraction. Wrong! For example, I read 2-3 books a week! I don't know many people with ADHD can do that. But for me taking clothes out of the dryer &amp; folding them, that's like climbing Mt. Everest 7. Those of us with ADHD don't need your sympathy, we need your empathy. We need you to understand that we are capable of so much but just need you to understand what our limits and challenges are. We don't want you to see our limits/challenges as excuses...they're explanations 8. For example, people will often say that people with ADHD tend to procrastinate. That is a total misunderstanding of what ADHD is about. Procrastination has a connotation of intentionally putting something off for various reasons. We don't want to be this way. 9. For people with ADHD the issue is often the difficulty starting things. It is enormously challenging for us in certain categories. The simplest things can be exhausting and feel impossible to begin/finish. It's stuff that doesn't make sense to people without ADHD. 10. Which is often why we hide these things that we find challenging because they can be embarrassing. I once had someone with ADHD, who made a good living, tell me that for years they would pay bills when things got shut off. It was a cycle they found nearly impossible 11. To get out of, it destroyed their credit, and it was only when they got married and their wife took over that they fixed their bill paying issue. People with ADHD hide a lot of shame in this and we hold it in because people don't understand our diagnosis. 12. Because of this shame, we don't talk about ADHD generally. We may talk about it with close family members or a psychiatrist but we don't talk about it with our friends &amp; certainly don't talk about it at work (I know this is a generalization and may not be true for you) 13. As egotistical as this may sound, I really hope to change that. I've been thinking about talking about ADHD for a few months and finally acknowledged how misunderstood it is among adults. Because we don't talk about it, ADHD has a big impact at work and home. 14. Now, I realize that being able to talk about it is a privilege. People rightly fear that they could be seen differently at work or may not get assignments they deserve. This is a step-by-step process that will take a while...but it's so important because ADHD has an impact 15. On people being successful at work and even getting a job. Some people think ADHD is over diagnosed...I don't know if it is or isn't, but I can tell you if it is, it's over diagnosed in kids. It's under diagnosed among adults. We know that if someone isn't diagnosed 16. As child, they're less likely to be diagnosed as an adult. Many people see ADHD (because of the hyperactivity component...which not all people with ADHD have) as a boy/man's disorder...which leads many women to not be diagnosed. 17. At home ADHD can have a big impact on relationships, we have a hard time staying organized and tidy. This can have an impact on relationships. I have taught myself many tricks over the years but many people with ADHD aren't taught to be mindful of their ADHD. 18. Want to know why I have so many towels? Yes, I can be bougie...I'll admit it. But its because it allows me to keep my bathroom organized. I found that it was very hard for me, especially when I have a lot of things going on in my life, to lay my towel over the bar. 19. My towel would often end up on the floor and I didn't want to live that way anymore. So I realized that if I just put a basket in my bathroom I could toss towels in there. Is it crazy to use a towel once and wash it? No doubt...but the alternative wasn't very attractive 20. What I have learned about ADHD is that it can ravage ones life if you let little things slip. I knew if I kept dropping the towel on the floor, I wouldn't make my bed, I wouldn't put my clothes away. Then, that would lead me to get depressed with the state of my home 21. And that would then bleed into my work, etc. I have had mixed success explaining my triggers to people. Some think I'm making excuses or they just don't understand why a simple thing like hanging a towel is a challenge. But I'm not going to stop explaining it 22. Last year I was meeting with a company that wanted to hire me and I told them I have ADHD and would find it challenging to work in an open office environment..the people I was speaking to understood that and were happy to accommodate it. But it hasn't always been easy 23. One of the challenges for me is in order to focus on something like writing, unless I have the adrenaline that comes with not wanting to get scooped, I have to really shut out everything. But people don't understand that I can't do a back and forth when I'm in that zone. 24. In the past (before I learned what systems I needed in place) I would see an email come in from a friend or colleague asking to chat. I would tell them I was focused on work and they would often say \"it'll just take a minute!\" They didn't get if I gave them that minute 25. That there was a good chance I wouldn't be able to get back to my work. People would get annoyed and think I was being difficult. That's the reason I'm talking about ADHD now, I hope people on both sides of ADHD can be more mindful of what works and doesn't work. (cont) 26. The best way I heard ADHD symptoms described was \"a Venn diagram with many circles.\" But it all boils down to this: we have things that challenge us, things that may seem simple/silly to you, but they're things that can quite take over and destroy our lives if not addressed.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"11744152"},"id_str":"11744152","name":"Yashar Ali 🐘","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"417929"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"22597"},"created_at":"Wed Jan 02 06:55:39 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"129321"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"26"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"28669"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"202380"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1103"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7784"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.04988"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Surprise","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"8"}}

This is the most excited I’ve ever been at any job ever. Ever. The lunch in question was shrimp fried rice which means this escalates from a misdemeanor to felony no doubt Case facts: Lunch was in fridge for less than an hour before it vanished. No shrimp smell remnants in the microwave or kitchen area. This was a professional hit no doubt HOLY SHIT. He’s back. He watched the tape. He knows who did it. So the man who’s lunch was stolen sits across from me. The person who stole his lunch sits RIGHT NEXT TO ME! She left for the day before the investigation started According to the video, this psychopath DIDNT EVEN EAT THE FOOD. She took it out of the fridge and threw and buried it in the trash Her motives remain completely unknown. In lieu of what he saw on the tape he has decided to not to press the matter anymore. I can’t say I blame him. We don’t know what this women’s fully capable of Points to clarify: he bought the shrimp fried rice around 11:30am (carry out) and put it in the fridge to chill until he takes lunch at noon. So she had exactly a 30min window of time to do what she did. There was no intention of microwaving the food Update: Ok so when dude watched the video with HR they asked “what do you want to do about it?” he told them he was solely interested in who did it and that he didn’t want to be responsible for someone getting fired After charges were dropped, HR sent a company wide email about not stealing people’s lunches. She is scheduled to arrive at work in 20min. My blood is on cocaine She has walked into the room. And the room is dead silent. Dead fucking silent yet there is a palpable explosive energy pulsing through everyone but her From the moment she walked in, I’ve just been staring at her. Watched her open her email and now she clicked on the goddamn HR email! Holy fuck strap in - here we go! I can’t move. I simply cannot move, anything could happen right now !!!! After seeing the HR email she says out loud “woah. Someone stole a lunch? Who would do something like that?” !!! I may have to run out of this room After she said that, shrimp guy responds “well yea it’s not ok to throw someone’s food away” we’re all about to start screaming This shits about to get crazier. After he says that she goes “oh it was your lunch?” BEAT she continues “well why would you go to HR about that?!” She has simultaneously denied her involvement AND called the guy who saved her job a snitch!!!!!!!!! Dude just sighed and went back to work after she said what she said. She looks frightwningly calm I’ll keep updating if anything else occurs but all I can say is that EVERYONE in the office from the janitor to the founder knows what she did. She now carries an invisible scarlet letter This is real. This is happening. We know who did it but we don’t know why. It’s a post production company so we’re in fact open today. She’s been sitting 3ft from me this whole time Unbeknownst to the guy and the woman, I just ordered 3 shrimp fried rice plates for lunch and will be hand delivering them She took the fried rice from me with a big smile on her face. She’s eating it and loving it. This is utter ruthlessness “I LOVE shrimp fried rice” - the thief I wish I could close this up with a neat little bow, but, it appears that we may never know why she did it. Maybe she doesn’t know she did it. Either way I’m now forced to work 40hrs a week next to a cold blooded individual Monday Morning Update: I was the first one into the office. She was the second. Just her and I, sitting 3ft away from each other in an empty room for over an hour. Every breath felt borrowed. She has not seen any of this. OR she is thoroughly and convincingly pretending not that have seen it. Either way I’m still alive.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184180"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"354"},"texto":"Thread: While Mueller is investigating stuff everybody already knows, Trump has committed at least 116 clear impeachable violations of the Constitution in full public view. 1/X 2. The Constitution was written a long time ago. Some of the words have fallen into disuse. In particular, \"emoluments\" is not a word one often encounters in everyday conversation. 3. But it's really quite simple: it means pay for services, work, or position. Wages. Here: https://t.co/oQ2d7A59i6 4. Gain from employment or position. Payment for work. Salary, wages, fees, etc. See? It's not that hard. 5. There are two places in the Constitution where the President is forbidden from receiving emoluments. From receiving money for his position as, say, owner of a hotel, golf course, or facility. 6. The best known one, strangely enough, is the \"foreign emoluments\" clause. The media (remember them? Think \"emails\".) mostly likes to talk about this one. It's muddy. 7. It provides that no member of our federal government, implicitly including the President, may take any money \"of any kind whatever\" for himself from any \"King, Prince, or foreign State.\" 8. So - not *that* muddy. When Saudi Princes stay at Trump International Hotel, money goes directly from their pockets into his privately owned bank account. So these weasels play this \"well if it's not 👉 profit 👈 it's not really an Emolument...\" \"_of_any_kind_\". 9. So actually, yes, he violates the Constitution every time any agent of any foreign government checks out of his hotel, assuming they don't walk the check. 10. But the other one is even easier, even more obvious, even more blatant, and involves more direct harm to the American people. He routinely transfers money out of the United States Treasury into his bank account, ignoring the Constitution. Here is what it says: https://t.co/t1jZcNE3O7 8. This is the second paragraph down from where it says that only a natural born citizen can be President. The paragraph after the one that says if the President dies the Vice President takes over. 9. People, I have seen this referred to by our media (remember the media? Think \"emails.\" Yeah, them.) I have seen this paragraph referred to as a \"technicality.\" 10. If it's a technicality that the President has to be over 35 years old and a natural born citizen, if it's a technicality that the Vice President is second in line, then it's a technicality that he can't rent golf carts to the Secret Service. 11. It is *NOT* a technicality. It is a FUNDAMENTAL PROVISION OF OUR CONSTITUTION. THE PRESIDENT IS FORBIDDEN FROM SELLING OR RENTING GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT or from any state. It absolutely could not be any plainer. 12. On 116 occasions, as of this writing, the President* has taken the Secret Service to his private properties and sold and rented goods to them. This is ABSOLUTELY, EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN under our Constitution. https://t.co/0Jn07RlxvI 13. Yes, I care that the Republicoup sold our country to Vladimir Putin for a bowl of pottage. I care a lot. But meanwhile, the crookedest man in America is scamming your money every weekend. And the rules say he can't. 14. It doesn't say, \"he can trade his salary for all he can steal from the treasury.\" He doesn't have to keep his salary. We have to pay it to him. And whether he keeps it or not, HE CAN'T SELL OR RENT SHIT TO ANY AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL OR ANY STATE GOVERNMENT. 15. The language of the Constitution is as plain as the everyday language I use in my tweets. Old words are as meaningful as new ones. No wages, rents, fees, returns from property or position - owning a golf course is a \"position.\" 16. Two critical, Constitutionally provided entities are screwing you 7 days of every week, and have been since January 20th, 2017. The United States Congress, and the (allegedly) Free Press. 17. The rat bastard rented space in Trump Tower to the Secret Service while he was still President-Elect. So they could guard him and the First Bimbo. And that was legal. Nothing says the President-Elect can't scam money out of the treasury. 18. But the minute he fouled that Bible with his filthy hand and took the Oath of Office he was in violation of the Constitution he just swore to uphold. 19. If our vaunted Checks and Balances worked - if the Republicoup Congress wasn't corrupt and complicit - they would have begun Impeachment proceedings the following Monday. 20. Yes, literally. Say they found incontrovertible proof on Saturday that Donald Trump was born in Kenya. Would they have blown it off, said, \"Oh, that's just a technicality\"? Well, this crooked Congress, maybe. &lt;sigh&gt; 21. Say they found out on Saturday afternoon that he's a victim of progeria, not really 71 years old but actually 27. Does anybody think they'd have shrugged it off? 22. Goddammit, Grand Larceny is Not A Techicality. How fucking complicated is this? (voice through nose)👃\"Hurry up, Mueller.\" What. The. Actual. Fuck. 23. And people tell me, \"Oh, Jeff, don't be so negative. Our Constitutional Safeguards will save us.\" Yeah? I'm from Missouri.

So let's start by noting that someone purportedly interested in the history of ideas (and in the wrongs of binary thinking) decides to kick this thing off by dishonestly creating a binary between 'gender ideology' and 'the forces of reaction.' Judy, a large number of the ppl https://t.co/nkIHgQ8Dv3 opposing this are not 'Catholics' or 'evangelicals,' and you damn well know it. You are writing this in a left wing British publication steered by a well-known feminist woman, in the context of substantive resistance to this ideology mounted by left-wing feminist women, and your response is to refuse to even acknowledge our existence (let alone deal with what we're actually saying). \"Probably most famous 'feminist' academic in world in 'other feminists don't exist because they fuck-up my narrative' shocker.\" Do you want to talk about how the resistance to this ideology can also be traced to lesbian and feminist communities going back years? Do you want to talk about Mitchfest? Do you want to talk about the threats, and the intimidation, and the no-platforming of feminist women? No, you really don't do you? 2. \"Blah blah, ppl who oppose gender ideology only oppose it because they believe in the natural god-given roles imposed by patriarchy and this all totally makes sense of the radical feminist critique I'm ignoring here because yeah they're just like the Pope.\" https://t.co/rUz7ettUWa 3a. This is such a sneaky slippery mess.... The Pope thinks people can't choose their *gender* because it falsifies the reality of *sex* because conservatives think that sex=gender, and both are divinely ordained. There is whole load of other people out there who think you can't https://t.co/AtY3ozSfMt choose you sex (not your gender), and it has fuck all to do with the \"divinely mandated natural distinction between the sexes.\" Our crackpot theory is called 'mammals are sexually dimorphic because that's the evolved mechanism which creates variation, fitness, and the possibility of natural trait selection in lifeforms more complex than worms.' Bonkers. Everyone who is any way compelled by the claims of evolution is now in league with the Catholic Church. Well, that is a turn up for the historical books. This is so fucking disingenuous I just URGHHHHHH. b. It's worth nothing here also that while she's claiming that 'gender theorists' recognise that gender is not determined by sex (assigned at birth bullshit bullshit)... she is simultaneously refusing to acknowledge that there are people - us - who think sex exists and in no way should determine gender. There is this conceptual black hole in the genderists thinking in which they cannot acknowledge that sex could exist without gender, and which relies on maintaining that to abolish gender we must abolish sex... which is to say, they are the exact mirror image of the 'conservative' position they purportedly oppose (sex=gender), and their thought *depends* on erasing, or misconstruing, the gender critical position (sex =/= gender). 4. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. This isn't even disingenuous. It's just a flat-out fucking lie. Go and talk to the detransitioners Judy and ask if this feels nothing like indoctrination. Or try not agreeing, and then tell me it's just a form of freedom. https://t.co/Y5JdcqafX7 5. This is not entirely egregious, but won't acknowledge that the next move made will, by abolishing sex, actually erase the distinction it purports to recognise here. Bonus mandatory faux-sophisticate implication that 'ppl who think sex exists are a bit simple aren't they?' https://t.co/fZCpzZ7ygr 6. What I want to point to here is the constant error that is made by conflating the claim that sex does not necessarily determine gender, and the claim that sex does not historically determine gender. Beauvoir, along with *all* feminists, believes that sex-role are not https://t.co/DxAPKz4VF6 a *necessary* feature of sex (we can talk about bimodal personality distributions, but the point is, that does not change the fact that the vast majority of gendering is social construction). That does not mean that the way gender has been constructed in patriarchy has *nothing* to do with sex, and that we can just pretend that sex doesn't exist and is socially irrelevant, because under these conditions, its fucking relevant. If you want to abolish sex-based oppression, you actually need to abolish sex-based oppression, not just play make-believe. 7. Okay, so now get to the intersex appropriation. I'll spare you most of this, you all know the drill... But it's kind of interesting that she notes that although in this case sex is not a given, it is determined inside a biological framework... and then asks, what framework https://t.co/179S6RyZVx is used to make that determination? Um. You just said. A biological one. That is, a framework that aims to determine whether an individual has gone down the developmental pathway which would make them a member of the sperm-making class or the ova-making class. And no one is suggesting that that should lead to IGM. And to leverage the horror of historic IGM in order to support your ideology that sex is in some sense vastly indeterminate is morally egregious instrumentalization. 8. This is a totally classic Judy sleight-of-hand. At this point sex and gender start being run together and it's implied they are both historically determined in the same kind of way. And viola! The determination of sex becomes both 'constructed' and an 'existential choice.' https://t.co/LkShghln6a 9. More fantastical bullshit about how gender ideology is a form of freedom and no one is imposing their views on anyone. Go and talk to the young women in universities right now who don't agree with this crap and find out how much freedom they feel like they have. Hypocrite. https://t.co/CbZuzbE6VV 10. Back to erasing feminists and claiming anyone who opposes this is a conservative Christian. That's right Judy, radical lesbian feminists are really pro-life and think homosexuality is a sin. We have no problem with how people perform their gender. It just doesn't change sex. https://t.co/gVX3aDNQh5 11. No, we have no problem with teaching people about the diversity of how people can live a 'spectrum of gendered lives.' We have a problem with teaching people that that means they are in the wrong body and their bodies need to be changed to match their 'gender.' We have a https://t.co/uIy1VB4S4T a problem with spreading a thought system which leads gender non conforming kids into a lifetime of possibly unnecessary medicalization. And we have a problem with essentialising gender, which you should also have, if you had a shred of intellectual honesty left in you. 12. Having entirely failed to address any of the substantive issues or the persistent authoritarianism I'm now going to finish with a load more disingenuous BS about 'freedom' and 'diversity' and 'possibility' and 'complexity' which all sounds lovely and is fucking meaningless. https://t.co/w9394lpOfb Thank you and good night. *UGH* &lt;Ends&gt; https://t.co/ks0THVw1NV","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"225796043"},"id_str":"225796043","name":"Dr. Jane Clare Jones","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"9231"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1272"},"created_at":"Sun Dec 12 13:24:07 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"22088"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"27"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"564"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"4741"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"21"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"176"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.96601"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"1"}}

That rests squarely on Theresa May’s shoulders. https://t.co/DZmGV7fBy3 Then there was the huge increase in citizenship stripping under Theresa May, much of which was later found to be unlawful by the Supreme Court. https://t.co/NoUMmpO7Ri https://t.co/nQH6KfEy8r How about the thousands of “Skype families” created by her harsh new family immigration rules introduced in 2012? Children are forced abroad or separated from one of their parents by the £18,600 earnings rule. https://t.co/YPrzMba6eM Let’s not forgot how discriminatory that rule is, because women, ethnic minorities and those outside London are less likely to earn enough to live with their loved ones. That’s squarely on Theresa May’s shoulders as well. While we’re on discrimination, the High Court recently found one of the key planks of Theresa May’s hostile environment, the “right to rent” policy, caused landlords to discriminate against ethnic minority tenants when they otherwise would not. https://t.co/rrwDPFcwbG The 2012 family immigration rules also included the cruel effective closure of the immigration route for parents, forcing British citizens to move abroad to look after their elderly parents https://t.co/2wfhesqfXq There’s also what I can only describe as plain spitefulness to migrants. She seemed to be obsessed. Take the “go home” vans, for example. https://t.co/oaGJCeASOR Or the “deport first, appeal later” law. You can only appeal after you’ve been removed, making it far harder to fight your case. The Supreme Court found it to be implemented unlawfully. https://t.co/052C9w9AbC Or the English language testing scandal. Today, the National Audit Office found the Home Office presumed guilt and lacked expertise to verify cases. The Court of Appeal recently said the same. https://t.co/jmVhcpK7TX She took away rights of appeal for family visitors coming to the UK, preventing many from attending weddings, funerals, graduations and celebrations. Spiteful. https://t.co/rS4irVX017 She did whatever she could to prevent child refugees in Calais or in the UK being reunited with their family members. Cruel. https://t.co/nD2ZHi6Eb5 Also on children, she ramped up the cost of citizenship applications for children, almost certainly denying many children the British citizenship to which they should have been entitled. https://t.co/7xCFbwAFW0 https://t.co/8XXvDuwyHz The cost of immigration and citizenship applications in general skyrocketed, forcing migrants to leave the UK, borrow, scrimp and save or go illegal https://t.co/F2aph2ovg1 https://t.co/8d5b4pgjL3 The complexity of immigration law became infamous under Theresa May. Judge after judge has criticised the state of the law. Ordinary people simply cannot understand how the law affects them now. https://t.co/FhawMRoKcw The rules are such a mess now, due to changes in 2012, that an experienced immigration lawyer can barely get through an application for their own spouse. https://t.co/h8kmUHVfYb She introduced a cap on skilled migrants. That’s right, she stopped skilled migrants like doctors and IT specialists from coming to the UK even when they could not be recruited locally. Nuts. https://t.co/wbBHtMIfFp One of her most lasting and damning legacies may be from forcing EU citizens to apply to the Home Office for permission to remain in the UK after Brexit, which will leave probably hundreds of thousands illegal after the deadline. https://t.co/ODaW3nPQ8a There was a huge increase in the number of EU citizens detained in the UK, due to Theresa May’s illegal policy of rounding up suspected homeless EU citizens https://t.co/Z3CbxhIbUG EU citizens were also forced to complete additional paperwork to qualify for British citizenship from 2015 onwards. The added complexity caused many to be refused and loose the huge application fee. https://t.co/bEO2bF2S1Y Yet, despite all that, Theresa May never came close to meeting the net migration target she clung to. The policies were never based on evidence. They were never going to “work” on her terms. The public was never going to be reassured. They were little more than spite. Finally, I leave you with The Cat. Theresa May falsely claimed a migrant was not deported because of a pet cat. It was nonsense but was used to justify harsh new deportation laws leading to the removal of even those who came to the UK as kids. https://t.co/uHvLOf3pBt","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"73857275"},"id_str":"73857275","name":"Colin Yeo","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"21933"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2542"},"created_at":"Sun Sep 13 10:18:50 +0000 2009","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"22443"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"27"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"10202"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"22188"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"378"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"822"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.98542"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e8184183"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"357"},"texto":"Quick, brief refresher on my understanding of how we got here: 1. During 2016 primaries, Trump knows Obama/HRC did lots of sweet under the table deals with Russians/Iranians. To troll them, he starts bragging how he's going to be Putin's BFF once he's elected. 2. Hillary &amp; her team hatch a dirty trick to play on Trump: they'll hire an political communications shop named FUSION GPS to create what will be passed off as a collection of intelligence reports 'proving' Trump &amp; his campaign team are in the pocket of the Russians. 3. A Fusion GPS team made up of Glenn Simpson, Nellie Ohr, Mary Jacoby [Simpson's spouse] and former MI6 spy Christopher Steele, begins producing the fiction that later becomes known as 'the Steele dossier'. 4. In these fake intel report summaries, the Fusion team center their creative writing around several people involved in Trump's campaign: Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. 5. The best part of this dirty trick is the willing participation of many Obama holdover/Hillary sycophants sprinkled throughout the federal LEO/IC agencies only too willing to help launder this dossier &amp; pretend it's an intel product, not fiction from a political comms shop. 6. Simultaneously the dossier begins to have key details in it leaked to media allies such as David Corn of Mother Jones, strategic leaks that immediately place Carter Page and Paul Manafort under suspicion of being Russian agents. 7. While these strategic leaks are happening, people such as Sen. John McCain and Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie are being used to 'discover' the dossier &amp; bring it to the attention of the FBI, as well as to the attention of the Hillary campaign itself. 8. Thanks to the laundering of the dossier, the HRC campaign now has plausible deniability. Fed LEO/IC agencies are 'finding' the dossier on their own [wink wink!] &amp; reporters are 'finding' gov't sources who are 'independently' verifying the dossier by leaking it to them [wink!] 9. While that was going on, to give the Steele Dossier more credibility, Obama/Hillary sycophants inside the LEO/IC began actually SENDING spies to try to entrap Trump campaign staff. Carter Page, G. Papadopoulos &amp; others are targeted for fake 'recruitment' by 'Russians'. 10. While Page &amp; Papadopoulos are being set up by IC spies trying to entrap them, the plotters inside the LEO/IC agencies go to the FISA Court &amp; draw up a warrant to spy on Carter Page using the fake dossier as intel product. Reportedly, 1st warrant attempt is denied. 11. But they persisted! A subsequent warrant attempt on Page is granted. The plotters now have legal authority to begin intercepting all of the Trump campaign's electronic comms [EC's]. 12. The two pronged approach appears to be paying off. They have strategic leaks in the media keeping Trump's campaign under constant suspicion of being a Russian subsidiary while fed. IC/LEO agents are furiously spying on them trying to find dirt to derail Trump's candidacy. 13. AND IT DIDN'T MATTER. Hillary runs an inept campaign, Trump wins anyway. Now the real fun starts. https://t.co/Fmh8Z2eclm 14. Every action taken by the plotters prior to election day 2016 was based on Hillary winning. The Steele dossier was NEVER supposed to be thoroughly examined. It's careful laundering was to provide an excuse for leaks &amp; investigations. It CAN'T stand up to scrutiny. 15. So after this election disaster, the plotters now have to do two things: a. they have to keep HIDING their investigation into the Trump campaign [which they'd concealed from Congressional oversight] so they can find something to impeach him with. 16. and while doing that they must also b. they have to hide the real facts about where the Steele dossier came from and who paid for it. 17. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PLOTTERS, Democrats in Congress like Jerrold Nadler and Elijah Cummings were VERY VERY ANGRY at then-FBI Director James Comey for reopening the Clinton Email investigation after the Weiner laptop was discovered with 300,000 new HRC-related emails on it. https://t.co/LKRsQmiP6L 18. See, top Dems in Congress like Cummings &amp; Nadler were *convinced* Comey's reopening of that HRC email investigation played a huge part in Hillary's losing the election to Trump. So they DEMAND an investigation by the DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into this. 19. On Jan. 12, 2017, DOJ IG Horowitz GRANTS DEMOCRATS WHAT THEY WANTED. He announces a review of the DOJ/FBI's handling of matters prior to the 2016 Presidential election [which includes the Hillary Email investigation]. https://t.co/U2IN69fy9k https://t.co/OT7W2ySMl5 20. During the course of his review of the investigations/actions the DOJ/FBI was engaged in leading up to the 2016 election, here's what Horowitz discovers: Despite the best efforts of the plotters to hide it, he discovers the truth about the Steele dossier. 21. HOROWITZ is the one who discovers the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the creation of the Steele dossier by tracking the funding for it through the law firm Perkins Coie. 22. While tracing the origins of the Steele Dossier &amp; how it was laundered through fed. LEO/IC agents misrepresenting it - even in FISA warrants! - Horowitz *also* happens upon the text messages on the official FBI phones of the lead agent in 'Crossfire Hurricane': Peter Strzok. 23. While tracking down the origins/laundering of the bogus Steele Dossier, &amp; perusing the unbelievably juvenile text messages of Strzok/Page, Horowitz &amp; his team of investigators also uncover a plethora of strategic leaking by Andrew McCabe, among others. 24. So here's what Horowitz has been tipping Congress off to since October 2017, when he first began rolling out all the evidence of what he'd found since he began his investigation on Jan 12, 2017: 25. a. Bogus Steele dossier &amp; how it was created, paid for, laundered b. Abuse of the FISA court system to start investigations based on it c. Strategic leaks in media to 'back up' the dossier by top FBI/DOJ officials d. Alteration of official DOJ/FBI records 26. Horowitz released his report on McCabe first, which led to McCabe's being terminated. Several weeks ago he released the MYE report on Clinton Democrats were so hot to get that referred 5 people to the FBI OPR for pro-Clinton bias. Up next? The FISA Abuse/Trump Spying report 27. This is how we've arrived to where we are today: with Peter Strzok &amp; Lisa Page being the first of a phalanx of plotters who are going to be subpoenaed to testify before Congress about their roles in this plot to undermine a presidential electoin &amp; then targeting a President. 28. And there you have it. How a work of fiction, that placed a man in Prague who's never been to Prague, ended up being used to smear a Presidential candidate in the media, then to start *legal* spying on him &amp; his associates using fed. LEO/IC agencies. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"39076082"},"id_str":"39076082","name":"Brian Cates","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"132334"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1"},"created_at":"Sun May 10 17:00:12 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"431831"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"28"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"7279"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"18493"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"260"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"660"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"3.93663"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

Thanks to @JasperFakkert for all his suggestions &amp; edit work on this one. 3) Efforts by Democrat members of Congress to advance the narrative that Trump ‘obstructed justice’ have now replaced the disproven claims of Trump-Russia collusion. However, the public narrative of obstruction actually originated prior to Mueller's Report. 4) Less than 6-months after Mueller’s appointment—on October 10, 2017—the Brookings Institution published a report titled “Presidential Obstruction of Justice: The Case of Donald J. Trump,” which outlined a strategy whereby Mueller could refer his obstruction findings to Congress 5) Notably, two of the authors of the Brookings report were later retained by Rep. Jerry Nadler, House Judiciary Committee Chairman, on a consulting basis as special oversight counsels to the Democrat Majority Staff. 6) It was initially believed that the primary focus of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation centered around allegations of collusion, however, the release of Mueller’s report makes clear that substantial resources were dedicated to investigating potential obstruction charges. 7) The Mueller report stated that in regards to obstruction, several statutes could apply - including 1503 and 1505 - but the special counsel chose to focus primarily on Section 1512. Mueller’s report dedicates a full section to defending the use of Section 1512. 8) Among the first mentions suggesting the use of Section 1512 was a June 2, 2017 article by the website Lawfare. The article was written approximately two weeks after Mueller was first appointed as special counsel. https://t.co/fbwQPpuKZZ 9) Wittes, himself a Senior Fellow at Brookings, was also the author of an article in October 2016 that discussed the need for an “insurance policy,” which according to Wittes was a “cross-ideological network of lawyers and philanthropists” dedicated to fighting Trump in court. 10) It wasn’t just Lawfare that had focused its attention on Section 1512. The Brookings report, which was brought to my attention and initially covered in an article by @Joestradamus91, made Section 1512 a primary focus from an early start. https://t.co/IsGdMlCtrt 11) It is unclear whether the Brookings Institute report was part of this effort suggested by Wittes, who is also a Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution. 12) Brookings produced its first 108 page report, authored by Barry Berke, Noah Bookbinder and Norman Eisen on Oct. 10, 2017. They followed up with a 177 page 2nd Edition on Aug. 22, 2018 which also came with a lengthy 200 page appendix. https://t.co/M46I41UnRh 13) In the 2nd Edition, the Brookings report dedicated an entire section solely to exploring the use of Section 1512—and as they note in their report, they did so specifically because 1512 could be applied towards “obstruction” of potential and possible future proceedings. 14) On page 148, the Brookings report discusses the issue of referring the Mueller report directly to Congress: https://t.co/47JPrXGKGs 15) Although the Brookings report strives to make its case regarding congressional referral, at each turn it is forced to acknowledge that any referral option would be subject to the authority and oversight of then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. 16) Another problem exists. @realDonaldTrump was told on three separate occasions by Dir Comey that he was not personally under investigation by the FBI. Therefore, Trump could not obstruct an investigation of himself if he didn't know there was an investigation to begin with. 17) Regarding claims that President Trump might have obstructed an investigation into individuals other than himself, there would need to be a rationalization against presidential pardon authority. 18) On Feb. 12, 2019, Nadler announced that two of the Brookings report authors, Eisen and Berke, had been retained as special oversight counsels to the Democrat Majority Staff. They were appointed in advance of the April 18 release of the Mueller report. https://t.co/GWnWRfGJ2w 19) It appears that Nadler had intended for Eisen and Burke to lead a hoped-for May 2 questioning of AG Barr personally. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) commented on Barr’s absence and Berke's &amp; Eisen's planned involvement during an impromptu press conference on May 2: https://t.co/TlFAzCJmmA 20) Section 1512 is a rather obscure statute, a fact inadvertently highlighted in two separate letters sent by President Trump’s lawyers to SC Mueller. Section 1505, the standard for obstruction, is mentioned in the letters 39 times. Section 1512 is not mentioned once. 21) But apparently, there was one individual who had foreseen its possible use. On June 8, 2018, William Barr, now the Attorney General but then a lawyer in private practice, sent a lengthy memo to DAG Rosenstein and AAG Steve Engel. https://t.co/DXqM7uz4WO 22) Barr’s memo noted “It appears Mueller's team is investigating a possible case of \"obstruction\" by the President. Unlike the president’s lawyers, Barr predicted the use of Section 1512, noting, “It appears Mueller is relying on 18 U.S.C. § 1512. 23) This quiet battle between Mueller and Barr over the use of Section 1512 was first highlighted in an excellent article by Will Chamberlain of Human Events. https://t.co/KPUz3cPbk6 24) Barr appeared alarmed by the liberal application of Section 1512, observing that “any discretionary act by a President that influences a proceeding can become the subject of a criminal grand jury investigation, probing whether the President acted with an improper motive.” 25) Barr noted the spiralling outcomes that could come from use of the statute: “Simply by giving direction on a case, or class of cases, an official opens himself to the charge that he has acted with an \"improper\" motive and thus becomes subject to a criminal investigation.” 26) Mueller ultimately failed to provide a determination on obstruction directly, leaving the decision up to AG Barr, who along with then-Deputy AG Rosenstein, ruled that there was no obstruction by the president. 27) Barr said that he and Rosenstein did not agree with much of the legal analysis contained in the report and felt it represented the “views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law.” 28) Barr concluded: “The report itself points out that one of the likely motivations here was the president’s frustration with Comey saying something publicly and saying a different thing privately, and refusing to correct the record.” /End","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"792096589191852033"},"id_str":"792096589191852033","name":"Jeff Carlson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"37991"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"314"},"created_at":"Fri Oct 28 20:11:58 +0000 2016","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"19393"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"28"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4275"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"9141"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"153"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"326"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.30912"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Anger","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

For obvious reasons, his kleptocratic client had a perception problem, i.e. reality. Yanukovych is Putin's vassal. Manafort hid his involvement for years. https://t.co/gh2inHGQST But in an ironic twist of fate, Mueller is proving that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Like Jack Abramoff before him, Manafort's less glamorous financial crimes of loan fraud are (in his case comically) easy to prove. https://t.co/A3amtF43UE So, how does this all relate to #TrumpRussia? For starters, the obvious: Manafort was working for Russia the whole time. His Ukrainian boss was one master, but really he was the student, remade in Manafort's image. Manafort was also taking money from a key Putin ally... https://t.co/IQWkc3TEof Oleg Deripaska. The AP reported he paid Manafort $10 million per year until he got burned in a bad deal. Manafort wanted to 'get right' with Oleg Deripaska by passing him reports on the Trump campaign. Russian opposition leader @navalny revealed more: https://t.co/c9axgJeMq0 https://t.co/oGJO6exRDp Manafort passed information to Deripaska and on to the Kremlin via his man in Ukraine, \"Kostya from the GRU\" (that's Russian military intelligence) who showed up at a couple of key times during Manafort's run as Trump campaign manager. A key time when... https://t.co/oQWYE6HasC When Manafort showed up in late March, Kostya visited in early April. He visited for the RNC Convention in Cleveland. He visited in early August. https://t.co/yXjafk0fGm Every few months is how Kilimnick put it to Radio Free Europe. https://t.co/Gg8bv1A5PX So, George Papadopoulos has been courted by Russians in London, he's a foreign policy speech writer for Trump. Manafort gets a job in the campaign Kilimnick shows up in early April Weeks later Papadopoulos sends a signal for what he thinks is a meeting https://t.co/SNEciCBQTE https://t.co/Ore0gpGNK5 Manafort attends the #TrumpRussia meeting at campaign headquarters 5 weeks after the signal to meet Let me just say that Russian Intel would setup a quote pro quo this way for plausible deniability Talk about a Putin meeting, but you meet Natalia instead. She represented Putin https://t.co/6dVVgcO8ui Then at the RNC Convention the next month, Kostya comes back, so does Carter Page, and Ambassador Kislyak. Another signal is sent on US-Ukraine policy. Deal on. Right out of the #TrumpRussia dossier's I broke this exclusively btw. https://t.co/4BZztOX61k Russia released a big batch out Democratic emails a little later in three summer, just like Don Jr. Wrote that he'd love. But Hillary Clinton got a big convention bounce. So Donald Trunp publicly begged Putin for more emails, exposing the conspiracy. https://t.co/ySckA6DJxa Whoops! Kilimnick needs to discuss that major faux pas with Manafort promptly. It was Trump's last press conference until January 10th, 2017 when he hired Russia's top law firm to load a talkie with blank folders and bullshit about divestment. https://t.co/GU86Om24Y8 Manafort left the campaign weeks later in mid August, under escalating questions about his Ukrainian dark money schemes. But he continued to advise Trump at post through inauguration, even after the #TrumpRussia probe began! https://t.co/eBTLKuSywB https://t.co/dZpKN9ctrG When Manafort leaves, a new handler with links to Russia's propaganda machine took over, Steve Bannon.

Bannon took full advantage of the media flak from Democratic emails. And the campaign echoed the Kremlin line closely. https://t.co/prsbRCyrVR Rigged elections? That was a Kremlin psy-op run with RT aka Russia Today https://t.co/FF0J7XUKkI https://t.co/ndNrcEQzwL Let's not forget the Trump campaign's direct mimicry of Russian voter suppression propaganda which Trump picked up in early August, then dropped, then again in early October when the Kremlin started, according to last week's #TrumpRussia indictment. https://t.co/QyqvSiyNIR https://t.co/moAQ8QT4mY But you're asking, where's the Abramoff style scandal? Manafort involved at least three House Republicans in his secretive Ukrainian lobbying efforts aka FARA violations aka espionage. Let's focus on two big fish. California Reps. Rohrabacher &amp; Royce. https://t.co/Ipmrd0yn9O https://t.co/jHD1hxcNpO Rep. Dana Rohrabacher needs no introduction to my readers. He worked directly with the Kremlin's anti-sanctions crew, literally going to Moscow for material. He chairs the House subcommittee for Russian issues, under Rep. Royce. That's right... https://t.co/kFvnekCuf8 https://t.co/XhPF5DJola Rep. Ed Royce - who isn't running for re-election - Chairs the powerful Foreign Affairs Committee. Royce also took meetings with Manafort and domains funneled through \"Company A\" in today's Rick Gates plea in 2013 according to @jwlarrabee's criminal and election complaint. https://t.co/UOr5cZmK5d Others GOP lawmakers taking meetings and donations in Manafort's and Mercury's FARA filings (they're Company A) were Rep. Patrick Murphy, the anti-abortion Republican from Pennsylvania who resigned after forcing his mistress to have an abortion, and... https://t.co/SFkv9D31jF Senator Jim Risch sits on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and recently endorsed #TrumpRussia election interference as long as they keep doing it.

The Senate Intelligence Committee released a lot of documents last week and I touched upon this but didn't put two and two together until now. 2. There is a lawsuit ongoing right now in the UK. Orbis and Steele are being sued by Aleksej Gubarev, Webzilla, and XBT based off of memos in the dossier. 3. We know that McCain received the dossier via David Kramer back in November of 2016, and then he handed it over to the FBI.

This memo basically states, that Cohen, in Prague, made cash payments to Russian FSB connected hackers to target the DNC and other connected players. https://t.co/i7IDTNgLpJ 8. In this part here, they cover \"Guccifer 2.0\". https://t.co/oCWUMlPveA 9. In this part, they cover the phishing and malware that the establishment contends targeted members of the DNC and Podesta: https://t.co/N7rvtNfmR3 10. The problem?? MICHAEL COHEN HAS NEVER BEEN TO PRAGUE. It was debunked back after the dossier was released, when Cohen provided his passport, and receipts to prove he wasn't in Prague at the time of this report, or EVER. https://t.co/5zsoV8gYfN https://t.co/kGbcZ3Uikk 11. We all scratched our heads a few weeks ago, in mid April, when the \"Cohen in Prague\" story was trotted out again in front of the media. Why would they be bringing this up again, with such fervor? Oh I know why! Part II: https://t.co/SgDYquc2tU 12. The media was trying to get in front of this story, because of the massive implications it has. We learn in this lawsuit (included in what the Senate Intel Committee dropped) that McCain received this memo, along with a SENIOR LEVEL UK INTELLIGENCE official. 13. Lets go through the lawsuit together, and I will tie everything up in a moment. Kramer asked that McCain be briefed with anything further in re: to Russian interference in the election. https://t.co/GHcdLbXXQK 14. This entire page needs to be read- remember this is Orbis/Steele answering. It states here the Dec memo was given to McCain through Fusion, and then Kramer, encrypted- three hands to get this to him-- https://t.co/qau930k1Fa 15. \"We had to send this along because it was important. They should have known they shouldn't publish it or share it\" https://t.co/JiEmobLnAw 16. Here, they basically say that Fusion should have known not to disperse the December memo under a previous NDA (aka- Fusion may have leaked it) https://t.co/Ip6EiefgJo 17. \"We were providing the December memo to McCain and Kramer under their official capacity- that is how it was presented to us\" https://t.co/9x7N5ouMoK 18. This is interesting, because it states that this intelligence was delivered to Steele without him even asking for it. The question? Who brought it to him. I would be speculating if I answered that question, so I am going to wait until the end to do that. https://t.co/iKEfAgENIL 19. And finally, the big enchilada, they couldn't even PROVE the contents of the memo were true! So again, we have unverified information, which was provided to McCain and Kramer through FusionGPS in December, and was then used for something amazing. LOOK AT THIS. https://t.co/UCRXFPLsLL 20. Remember the contents of the memo? Russian and \"Romanian\" hacking financed by Cohen? Is it sheer coincidence that Crowdstrike happened to come out in December with their \"proof\" that Russia did the hacking, along with some of the language found in this memo? 21. Well it did. Take a look. https://t.co/MQr8DYgrPl https://t.co/ZCEsBWueER 22. It appears that Crowdstrike obtained this memo, either via Fusion GPS (as insinuated in the lawsuit, by Orbis) or via McCain, and then used this memo as the foundation for the charges that \"Russia hacked the DNC\".https://t.co/Uf6iqp4o5g https://t.co/Bohz3AhreV 23. As a matter of fact, not two weeks later, the official intelligence report concluding the Russian hacking was released. Was it all based on this unverified, now provably false, intelligence memo which was handed to Steele unprovoked? https://t.co/GyMLHBx6Tl 24. One more: https://t.co/HuOCejvpj1 https://t.co/Pi8KQrYfk0 25. So it appears, that select folks in the IC, who had used the unverified dossier already to obtain FISA warrants, etc, via Fusion and McCain/Kramer, used this bogus December memo as the proof that the hacking was done by Russia, and then someone passed it on to Crowdstrike... 26. My question is, who provided the intelligence to Steele? What did McCain have to do with it? Did Fusion provide it to Crowdstrike? Did they even ANALYZE the DNC Servers? did the IC report use this memo as its basis?? IS THIS ALL THEY HAD!?!?!?! 27. Here is a video report. Please share and add comments below. https://t.co/QYP3ZMjVPv AND! It makes it worse that they KNOW THIS in the Senate Intel Committee and they STILL said that there was Russian interference. That committee is biased, conflicted, and useless. First Warner, then Jones (Feinstein) and now this? Wow.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"24822993"},"id_str":"24822993","name":"Tracybeanz","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"124551"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"981"},"created_at":"Tue Mar 17 02:27:13 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"36331"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"28"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"20702"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"41757"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"739"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1491"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.27635"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

Stone's filing is causing a glaring fact to have it's visibility significantly raised: the FBI is admitting it was never ALLOWED to actually SEE any of the evidence of Russian hacking; they were never allowed to examine the servers. They took Crowdstrike's \"expert\" word for it. This has been out there for months, but having Stone make this filing right now throws a huge spotlight on it. Trump's been hinting for a long time on his Twitter \"the FBI never got to examine it!\" [the server] Trump is holding all the cards. The slow, patient rollout of the case for there having been an actual real SpyGate plot is working. Understand: this has to come out in bite-sized chunks for the people in the MIDDLE, who aren't in the Trump camp, but aren't Democrats. SpyGate plotters have been trying for two years to TROLL Trump into ripping the lid off this Pandora's box early, before there was MAJORITY PUBLIC SUPPORT for investigating/prosecuting the SpyGate coup. They **continue** to fail to prod Trump into going early. Trump is making moves to get the public ready for the declassification and the unveiling of the prosecutions. Forcing the Theresa May gov't in the UK to finally reveal the 2015 Hezbollah Bomb Plot In London on it's way out the door was another key piece of the preparation. Desperate SpyGate plotters wanted Trump &amp; his team to 'go' over a year back. They were fully prepared to use their media allies to try to win a PR battle that Dictator Trump was going after his enemies using federal agencies to exact revenge. IF Trump had gone early, WITHOUT that undecided middle who still thinks there just might be something to this idea Trump is a Russian puppet, that would have been used against him. By the time he goes, his approval rating will be north of 50% and.... ...the MAJORITY of the public will KNOW they were lied to for more than 3 years about this RussiaGate stuff. They will KNOW Trump was never a Russian agent &amp; that it was all a set up that had it's origins inside the Hillary Clinton campaign &amp; partisans in the federal agencies. Can you grasp that TRUMP KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING? I mean, can you? At all? Because there a LOT of people who are telling you right now Trump is epically botching just about everything. Wray's still at the FBI! He hasn't done the declassification yet, they're preventing him from doing it! McCabe blackmailed people into walking away from a grand jury! According to the script the SpyGate plotters were writing back during the Trump transition period, when the unthinkable and the impossible had happened – Trump had won the election! - Trump was supposed to have been removed from office by now. What's ***the entire Trump/Russia collusion conspiracy narrative*** based on? What's the ***key evidence*** that made it all go? It's that at the direction of the Trump campaign, Russian hackers broke into the DNC servers &amp; stole emails that the Trump campaign then worked with WikiLeaks to publish. The FBI claimed ***in court*** this Russian hacking had been \"proven\" to have happened. We learned MONTHS ago that the FBI was ***never*** allowed to see those servers. We learned they only got to see a heavily redacted DRAFT report made by Crowdstrike, a contractor working for the DNC thru the law firm Perkins Coie. Trump has ***highlighted*** this fact several times on his Twitter: https://t.co/T0itkSkyiu Note these tweets from the President that I\"m linking here are from A YEAR AGO. https://t.co/FWyp68jyIC From November of last year: https://t.co/2jPx97iI88 From May 2018. Do you realize just how LONG Trump has known exactly what happened? https://t.co/tBpXDVbzuh If he's holding a royal flush [and he is!] and he's WAITING to lay the cards down on the table, he has his reasons. Meanwhile more and more of the PUBLIC is coming around to the view that yes indeed, some really shady, corrupt stuff went on to target Trump &amp; his campaign. Now that more and more of the PUBLIC is seeing the Russian collusion narrative and the Mueller investigation are exactly what Trump has said they were for more than 2 years - a dirty trick of a witch hunt ginned up by the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democrats &amp; DNC Media? HIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE GOING UP. He labored underneath a cloud for the past 2 1/2 years. That cloud is now LIFTING. The pathetic antics of the House Democrats isn't stopping that cloud from lifting. The **RESULTS** Trump is getting are being noticed. Can you imagine the FUN Trump is going to have trolling all these desperate idiots over the next year as his approval ratings keep climbing while more and more of the corruption of the SpyGate plotters, DNC Media &amp; the Obama admin. continues to be exposed? This is the exact OPPOSITE of how the script was **supposed** to go. His approval ratings are supposed to be in the mid-20's at best, he's supposed to be isolated, under siege inside the White House, depressed and chugging Diet Coke &amp; watching too much TV. He's supposed to be fending off impeachment hearings in the House based on all the \"evidence\" that Flynn, Cohen, Manafort &amp; others gave to Mueller after they 'flipped' on him &amp; spilled their guts about the Trump campaigns collusion with the Putin gov't. Well what's about to happen INSTEAD? The entire origin of the fake Trump/Russia narrative is going to be fully exposed. Simultaneously with WHY that narrative had to be created [Iran Deal, U1, foreign bribery] the HOW is going to also be exposed. And Crowdstrike providing this BS \"evidence\" to the FBI \"proving\" that Russian hackers hacked the DNC server to steal these emails played a VERY LARGE ROLE in the launching of the Trump/Russia collusion narrative. And Trump and his team have been getting ready to expose this for over 2 years. And there's nothing these desperate losers can do to stop what's coming. /end","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"39076082"},"id_str":"39076082","name":"Brian Cates","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"132334"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"1"},"created_at":"Sun May 10 17:00:12 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"431831"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"28"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"13124"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"36670"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"469"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1310"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"3.93663"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

Does the UK get value for money from the EU? \"We pay in more than we get back\" cry the Brexiteers... \"the UK could lose one hundred billion pounds from the economy and a million unemployed\" replies the CBI. So lets take a look at the FACTs https://t.co/pcSsErL20k 2/ CASH IN AND CASH OUT According to Page 40 of Her Majesties Treasury report at December 2015 entitled “European Union Finances 2015”, the UKs contribution to the European Union (our ‘membership fee’) that Brexiteers tell us we could *save* and spend on building new hospitals, 3/ schools and the like is £12.36 billion in 2015. *This figure is calculated as a percentage of Gross National Income, or GNI. The United Kingdom received an ‘instant rebate’ of £4.86 billion. (not sent to the EU) 4/ This is calculated before we make any payment at all which means that the cash amount that we sent to Brussels last year was just £7.5 billion. To put this in perspective, the Department for Communities and Local Government statistical dataset of December 3rd 2015, 5/ there are 27.4 million households in the UK. The UK cash contribution therefore is £273 per household per year, or using an average of 2.34 people per household (DCLG figures) £116.97 per person. So starting with £7.5 billion, lets look at some of what we get back: 6/ UK Farmers receive direct payments of just under £4 billion through the Common Agricultural Policy and Agriculture funding. The European Social Fund which support charities across the UK with a variety of grants, and the UK Cohesion Fund that funds various infrastructure 7/ developments in the UK contribute around £1.96 billion (total of £11.8bn between 2014 and 2020). And a further £108 million is paid back to the UK in grants towards a number of other projects. 8/ So from the £7.5bn we pay, we get back around £6bn in direct cash payments, leaving a net cash difference of £1.5 billion per year. 9/ EU MEMBERSHIP EFFECT ON UK GDP Of course, as EU members we are able to access the European Single Market which means we are able to sell unlimited products, and services made in the UK totally free of tariffs and duties. 10/ This means that the UK can import parts and raw materials relatively cheaply keep cost of production low and it also means that UK made goods are competitively priced in the largest bloc of customers on the planet. 11/ Combined, this makes the UK a great destination for UK and foreign manufacturers to invest and create British jobs, and help build the UK economy. Without this unlimited free trade, it is guaranteed that investment in the UK economy would slow down. 12/ I’ve looked at some of the contributors to UK GDP. I have made some assumptions that you should be aware of: Firstly, the figures here are not the TOTAL contribution to the UK economy of each sector, but I have pared it back substantially and am only including the portion 13/ of GDP that is related to our EU membership. For example, it is likely that cars will still be made in the UK, but not as many as today if we leave. 14/ Automotive sector: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and KPMG carried out extensive analysis of the UKs automotive sector. Their conclusions from the final report entitled “An economic assessment of the UKs automotive industry with the European Union” are 15/ are that over 700,000 people in Britain are employed in the automotive sector, and the total contribution to the UK economy is in excess of £60 billion in 2013/14. One example is Nissan in Sunderland who build 500,000 cars per year only sell 19% of their production in the UK 16/ For the contribution to the UK economy from the EU, I’ve deducted just 40% from the total GDP contribution here: The UK automotive sector makes cars in the UK for the EU £36.3 billion per year. 17/ According to the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) report in conjunction with Deloittes, inward travel on business from other EU countries £0.95bn per year. (not tourists, just business). 18/ The UK Agri-Food sector employs over 3.5 million people in the UK and contributes over £103 billion in GVA to the UK economy in 2013. Of this a significant proportion is exported all around the globe – I have used a figure here of £70.15bn per year. 19/ TheCityUK report “A practitioners guide to Brexit: exploring its consequences and alternatives to EU membership suggests that the UK financial and related services sector employs 2.2m people in the UK and of a total GDP contribution to UK GDP of £66bn in 2014/15. 20/ Exports to other EU countries from this sector were far in excess of the £19.7bn per year figure I am using. Just between those 4 sectors UK GDP is enhanced by £127.1 billion each year. 21/ Remembering that our net cash contribution to the EU was just £1.5 billion, and the UK economy benefits from just those four sectors by £127.1 billion, you would think that was already a pretty good deal eh? However, the benefits continue... 22/ FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT As a result of the UKs membership of the EU, we hold over one trillion pounds of money in UK bank deposits from the other 27 EU countries – it is impossible to think that they would leave all that here if we vote to Leave. 23/ Lets assume that we lost just 17% of that figure – that would be a loss of £170 billion out of the UK banking sector (around half the amount that UK Government bailed out the banks back in 2009). 24/ By 2014, the UK received £1,065 billion of foreign investment into the UK economy from countries all around the world. A large portion of this is to build products in the UK to sell tariff free into the EU. 25/ A HUGE benefit to the UK of remaining members of the EU. Of course we would not lose all that investment, but lets say that other EU countries withheld 40% their investment from the UK and put that money to use elsewhere in the EU..... continued in next thread..... 26/ that would be loss of around £170.1 billion out of the UK economy. If other countries around the world reduced their inward investment into the UK by 25%, that is further loss to the UK economy of another £150 billion. 27/ So the UK pays net £1.5 billion a year and we get back at least £127.1 billion into GDP from trade, and a further £320.1 billion in EU related FDI…. creating UK jobs. So far that’s an annual benefit to the UK economy overall of £128.6 billion. 28/28 And Brexiteers continue to cry about our 'membership fee'? They just dont understand whats going on around them or where their jobs came from!","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"36667656"},"id_str":"36667656","name":"Real_JasonJHunter","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"31542"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3544"},"created_at":"Thu Apr 30 13:59:24 +0000 2009","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"11676"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"28"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3908"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7132"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"140"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"255"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.98885"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"6"}}

I've learned some things from watching the fairweather friends each time they feel like ditching him. So here goes. (2) Facts don't care about your feelings. When you freak out and whine about actions you don't like, it makes you look like an SJW snowflake looking around for a safe space. You have abandoned critical thinking. (3) I actually used to be an SJW. It was Donald J Trump who rescued me from the mental quicksand of the Left. And it was also Thomas Sowell, Kurt Schlichter, Saul Montes-Bradley, Omni Ceren, Larry Schweikart and John Bolton. (4) I'm never going back to SJW-style feeling. I won't call it thinking, because it's not. I have learned: &gt;to question everything &gt;how to assess credibility of claims and sources &gt;how the American system of government works in 2018. (5) Wrote this for my peers who still support POTUS after the necessary evil of signing the bill he called \"ridiculous\" today. Some of you aren't as battle-hardened as me when it comes to the haters. So I will share my approach. When I say \"you,\" I'm usually referring to them. (6) The first time I could see who they really are was when the US military bombed the Syrian airfield where the tyrannical Assad regime had launched its chemical attacks on the children of Ghouta in February 2017. (7) After the justified &amp; successful Syrian airfield bombing I was surprised, disappointed and a little hurt by the betrayal of certain \"Trump supporting\" public figures. I unfollowed them on Twitter and stopped sharing their tweets without caveats. (8) The next time they revealed themselves was when the US military dropped a MOAB on about 500 jihadists in Pakistan in April 2017. IMHO the only way to protect innocents from the most hardened terrorists is to kill them. (Explained below): (9) Life imprisonment carries the risk that a future administration will release these hardened terrorists, to kill again. They can never be rehabilitated. Candidate Trump was very clear he agrees with these views. (10) In response to the renewed wailing, I unfollowed some more, &amp; got a little bolder in speaking out against their betrayal. Then POTUS made some genius tactical moves on DACA &amp; other border stuff in Sept. Boy, did the fairweather friends come out in force when he did that. (11) By now I had learned to stop and think before reacting, and to do my own research, with help from trusted commentators. Dealing with the naysayers was becoming easy, and even fun. (12) I knew Trump wouldn't just give DACA recipients and their extended families amnesty, and certainly not without establishing such extensive measures and timeframes to make it all but impossible for people to obtain citizenship this way. (13) I still trust him to do the best thing for Americans first on this matter. So seeing \"No DACA\" and \"No Amnesty\" was a dead giveaway as to whether someone was on my wavelength or not. (14) When POTUS was leading the Tax Bill process in November and December 2017, there were confused worriers then, too. Occasionally I would give information to the nice ones; and troll the unpleasant ones, as if I was a cat repeatedly tossing a half dead mouse in the air. (15) I will never forget the remarks made and photos taken after that bill was signed. I realized Hatch, McConnell and even Ryan patently weren't as determined to abuse GOP voters as the fairweather friends had convinced me they were in 2016. (16) Even Bob Corker smiled when someone thanked Trump for his part in the tax bill. I have the screenshot. All 50 GOP Senators in DC voted for it. Only McCain didn't, since he was in Arizona. But still the naysayers deny that some of them can ever do anything right. (17) On December 12, Roy Moore lost the ALSen race. The usual suspects had been on his side, even in the primary when Trump had clearly preferred Luther Strange. (18) Not enough AL GOP voters listened to Trump and trusted his judgment. End of story. I blocked an enormous number of people because of their irrational screeching about Roy Moore. Oh well. (19) Other events occurred that reinforced my views about these self-proclaimed sometime Trump \"supporters.\" In short, they are either mistaken about the facts or, more likely, were never Trump supporters. (Continued) (20) They come in various flavors, foreign and domestic. Some are literally Russian (you can tell by the broken English), or Russian-funded, or Russian-sympathetic. (21) Russia wants to stoke division in the USA. If you don't get that, then you clearly haven't been paying attention lately, or learned the history Europe in the last 102 years. I'm not your research assistant so at this point you'll need to find the information yourself. (22) It's actually easy to spot these fake Twitter accounts using a number of variables you can see on their profiles. A low follower count is the most obvious one, but occasionally you see them with &gt;1,000. (23) The American public figures who whine, such as Laura Ingraham (who has even dined at Mar-a-Lago during Trump's Presidency), are motivated by self interest. Playing the part of a contrarian garners TV ratings, online clicks, and book sales for them. (24) I'm no public figure, but I can write. As I could never sell out my beliefs or be controlled by a boss or funder, I prefer to work for free. This is the best hobby ever. (25) This week I've written about the budget bill several times, in the courteous, reasonable way I do for good-faith readers. Suffice to say, I understand and support Trump signing the bill. He has weighed the pros and cons, with what he knows (which is more than we do). (26) His oath of office places protecting Americans and America as his highest priority. Military defense is not negotiable. Also, the bill only lasts for 6 months! And he can choose not to use all of the allowed budget in many of the line items, too. (27) Every problem the naysayers have with this bill was caused by people other than Trump. You elected them or allowed them to beat candidates you wanted (or you were too young to vote). The solutions to the problems are also now in your hands, not Trump's. Midterms coming up. (28) What America now needs is your work to return the largest possible majorities in Nov. To those laying on the floor having a tantrum: Every hour you waste helps the Dems, NeverTrumps, Russia, &amp; all the other countries threatening us &amp; stealing from us, with/without RU help. (29) So think about that. And if you try to waste my time complaining to me, don't expect much of a response. I've heard it all before. My attention is a privilege not a right and must be earned.

I stood up for both of us. The harassment and undermining of my critical terrorism work by these two got worse. I tried to tell my Assistant Director Andrew McCabe but was told (14) contacting him was inappropriate. Mind you, I had worked with McCabe since 2005 and he had been my boss at Washington Field. So I contacted EEO, since working through the Ombudsman was useless. I had been working on a major disruption of a bombing plot and ten days later (15) I was involuntarily removed from my position. My Deputy Assistant Director told me the AD, McCabe, made the decision. So that’s where I ended up, in that administrative unit doing GS-4 work as a GS-15 step 4. It was there that I saw the write up for someone to get the Director’s Award for that operation I had discussed earlier in this thread. The narrative contained MY accomplishments but put someone else’s name as the recipient. They even left in personal commendations from Gen McChrystal and now Gen Flynn, both who didn’t know the buddy of (17) of McCabe’s who actually got the award and $10k as part of it. Yes, this other person, now head of an office on the West Coast and a part of McCabe’s regime got the Director’s Award using my accomplishments. Meanwhile, I was actively pursuing my EEO, paying about $57k in (18) attorney fees in one year. I was notified more than a month after I filed the EEO, that I was under OPR for time and attendance, insubordination and disruptive behavior while on duty. These charges are used by people when they have nothing but want you out. (19) The two brain surgeons who filed the OPR left their emails in my folder which I got to review. In their emails they discussed what they could “throw at her,” that one had a friend in OPR doing “an off-line OPR” and he would have a “solid” opinion of what to file by (20) end of the day. The response from one of them struck me and should horrify you, the public. One simply said “just stick with the plan”. The plan... what plan was I being held to secretly. After a year and a half of being viciously retaliated against, treated like garbage, (21) and ignored when I tried to help on the Benghazi attack. They ostracized me, told people not to talk with me, actually told one agent to F with me, and I had constant chest pains and diverticulitis attacks. The toll this took on my parents is something I don’t think I can (22) forgive. My father had a diverticulosis event that caused excessive internal bleeding and led him to be medivaced to a large hospital.All the time I was being advised not to take any leave to go see him as I was already under a microscope. I eventually told them to F off (23). I wouldn’t be able to tell everything they did to me. That’s for my EEO that has had no movement in about six years. I lost my house, I was considered homeless for two and a half years because I stayed where I could, at my parents. My health has suffered. I sold my jewelry (24) I sold my plasma to get money to eat and to feed my dogs. More than 1/2 of my household contents were donated. Stuff I paid good hard-earned money for. I was an honest and ethical Agent. McCabe signed off on the destruction of my life. He should be fired before the weekend (25) I’m trying to rebuild. I’m blessed to have a job after not being able to get one over minimum wage for over two years. That’s what happens in the FBI corrupt “leadership “. They destroy you even after you leave. I have a Go Fund me account because I anticipate more legal (26) fees. https://t.co/gZCk3COvQv (27) here are links to my story being told by amazing people https://t.co/NApgvJd52l https://t.co/Sit9N6FdFY https://t.co/1FBY5efpNt In her own words interview https://t.co/cfJQM0COr8 Discussing General Flynn (28) https://t.co/XORv8QygZn.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818418b"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"365"},"texto":"AMERICA, WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE. Yesterday, as Trump was ranting about “shithole countries,” I was in a county courthouse in Georgia looking at a death certificate for a black man who died in 1930. I watched the courthouse employees’ faces... 1/ closely as they read the cause of death “Unlawful act.” Their confused looks confirmed what I suspected; they had never seen such a vague description listed as a cause of death. They clearly did not know about the incident that occurred there 88 years before, even though it 2/ had been the focus of national news for weeks back in 1930. “It was a lynching” I explained, pointing to the word scribbled in parenthesis on the document. I had them pull another death certificate; this one for a white 16 year-old girl who had died one day prior to the man. 3/ Her cause of death was listed as “Murder.” The man was accused of raping &amp; murdering the girl the day before. He had fled into the woods after locals spotted him on the road not far away from her body. The sheriff arrived quickly &amp; immediately called for assistance from... 4/ neighboring law enforcement agencies. They began tracking him as soon as dogs arrived; first, along a creek through the woods, then across fields &amp; through more woods. It continued for eighteen hours, with more &amp; more men joining in from other counties, until the track ended 5/ at a cabin nearly 20 miles away. The posse, which had grown to nearly one thousand by that time, quickly surrounded the house. The owner told the sheriff that the suspect was not there. However, when the sheriff &amp; two deputies searched it, they discovered him hiding in the 6/ kitchen. The posse waited restlessly outside as the sheriff questioned the suspect. The restlessness quickly transformed the men from a posse into a mob. They rushed into the cabin &amp; grabbed the owner, intending to “teach him a lesson” for sheltering the suspect. Fortunately 7/ the sheriff was able to calm them down. Unfortunately, their focus turned to the suspect. The heavily armed mob told the sheriff that he could maintain custody of the suspect, but instead of the county jail, they would be taking him to where the girl’s body was found. He was 8/ ordered to follow a truck loaded with 15 armed men. Another 75 to 100 cars &amp; trucks followed closely behind the sheriff. When the caravan reached the city limits, the sheriff – knowing that the mob likely intended to lynch his suspect – attempted to get away when the lead... 9/ truck made a turn. Dozens of shots were fired, disabling the sheriff's car. The sheriff, deputies &amp; suspect were forced into another vehicle &amp; transported to mob’s intended destination. Upon arrival, the suspect was chained to a tree. A crowd of more than a thousand, ... 10/ including women &amp; children, watched as his fingers and toes were removed, “joint by joint.” A pole was jabbed into his mouth when he began to scream. It was removed only long enough to pull his teeth with pliers. More torture, to gruesome to describe, took place. In total, 11/ it lasted for more than an hour. He was still alive when the mob piled sticks &amp; logs under him, poured gas on &amp; ignited the fire. Several men fired their weapons at pointblank range. The body was left there for the day. Thousands of people “rode out to see the spectacle.” 12/ Twelve hours later, at sunset, the sheriff &amp; deputies removed &amp; buried the body. Details of the lynching were published in America’s newspapers from coast to coast. Despite an investigation, which included convening a grand jury, no one was ever charged. The reason I ... 13/ decided to tweet about this is because of what happened next… not back in 1930, but YESTERDAY, both in that Georgia courthouse and in the White House. After I concluded providing them with the details, one employee nodded approvingly, “They knew how to 14/ handle things back then.” “Good for them,” said another. The 1st began to expound on their opinion; \"You know, it's about damn time we stopped being afraid to-\" when a black women walked into the office. The employee cheerfully greeted the lady with familiarity \"Hey, Betty.\" 15/ I watched as they exchanged pleasantries. The employees' tones &amp; demeanor had completely changed. It was both astonishing &amp; disturbing. It was as if I was watching a performance, done for an audience of one; Betty. I had the urge to shout, \"Don't believe it Betty! It's just 16/ an act! RUN!\" But of course I just stood there, for just long enough to not seem rude. Having concluded my business, I thanked them &amp; left. I started the car &amp; by habit, turned on the radio just in time to hear about Trump’s “shithole” remarks. I cringed. There was no doubt 17/ in my mind where the “It’s about damn time we stopped being afraid to-” remark was headed had the black lady not walked in at that time. I had heard that tone &amp; seen that sneer too many times before. Like when I was 9 years-old, &amp; a neighbor jubilantly exclaimed \"Somebody - 18/ finally killed that nigger!\" The 'somebody' he was referring to turned out to be James Earl Ray &amp; the 'nigger' was Martin Luther King Jr. That was the day, the exact minute, when I realized how truly evil racism was. Yes, I had seen news stories showing protesters being - 19/ knocked down with fire hoses, attacked by dogs &amp; beat with clubs, but that was on TV, somewhere else far away. Seeing Farmer Jekyll transform into the demented Farmer Hyde right in front of me was traumatic. It scared the hell out of me &amp; I never forgot it. I never - 20/ respected him again. I saw &amp; heard that same deep hatred in that courthouse yesterday and I felt that same sickness gnawing at my soul as it did on that terrible day in 1968. Listening to the news about Trump on the way home, I recalled other racist things he has said &amp; done. 21/ I also remembered how, during Obama's presidency, Republicans had made absurd &amp; baseless claims that Obama was not only not a Christian; he was a Muslim &amp; a racist, intent on destroying America by dividing us. And look at those same Republicans today; practically worshiping 22/ a pathetic excuse for a man who is doing exactly what they falsely accused Obama of doing. People like those I saw yesterday, who make up Trump’s base, key off of every hateful ignorant word Trump spits out, whether it’s through his foul mouth or by applying his pudgy little 23/ fingers to a keypad. And all it would take to send them into an uncontrollable rage is for Donald Trump to say something just as their inner hatred hits the boiling point. Donald Trump personifies everything that is WRONG with America today. He is greedy. He is a misogynist. 24/ Donald Trump is a bigot. He is a hypocrite, both religiously &amp; patriotically. He is hateful. Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump is un-American. Donald Trump has not only broken his oath &amp; trampled on our Constitution, he has pillaged &amp; profiteered like a pirate, all 25/ under the protection of the GOP. Donald Trump has removed the name of Lincoln from the Republican party &amp; replaced it with his own. Donald Trump is that mob from 1930. Donald Trump will NEVER be my president. I am #TheResistance! #StrongerTogether #VoteBlue2018 #FireTheGOP 26/26 👉Post-tweet👈I've tried to respond to questions/criticisms, but I can't keep up. The most frequent was that I SHOULD have \"called them out\" (courthouse employees) or \"reported\" them. Keep in mind that there is much more to this story than I've posted here. It is not over. PT1 The focus of this is about something much bigger &amp; I will more than likely have to review more records in that office. There's more than enough time to deal with them. The 2nd thing was that I should have \"warned\" Betty. Get real, folks. She was in no danger &amp; there's NOTHING PT2 that 👉I👈can \"teach\" a middle-aged black woman about spotting racists in her own hometown. In fact, Betty is the one that can teach me as well as a few others in this thread.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"311167475"},"id_str":"311167475","name":"Chet Powell","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"30999"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"13999"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 05 00:46:18 +0000 2011","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"41635"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"29"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"61377"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"177067"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"4"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2116"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"6106"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.87277"},"all_hashtags":["TheResistance","StrongerTogether","VoteBlue2018","FireTheGOP"],"emocion_media":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}

A Prequel to the “Cricle of Filth”: Special Counsel (SC) let by Robert Mueller was formed to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. DA Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller former director of FBI On May 17, 2017. 2. What follows is my feeble attempt to make sense of both the timeline of event and the actual information thus far publicly available. The media’s coverage has had the effect of muddying already murky waters. 3. Mueller’s SC was composed of many left leaning individuals, many who contributed to Hillary &amp; Obama’s campaign. The group has been under intense focus over last few weeks. I expect more negative information to unravel about this group in next few weeks https://t.co/ZLFbAMwDO4 4. One focus of SC is the Trump-Russia or Steele dossier or the dossier as I will call it. In Oct 2015, during Republican primary The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump. 5. Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, The Free Beacon stopped funding this research 6. In April 2016, the investigation contract and funding were taken over by Marc Elias, a partner in Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie. Elias was the attorney of record for the DNC and the Clinton presidential campaign. (Yes, its not a typo.) 7. In total, Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, $168,000 from this payment was paid to Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, and used by them to produce the dossier. https://t.co/9KyQek6QXU 8. June 2016, after DNC website hack, Fusion GPS hired Orbis to look into Russian connections. The investigation was undertaken by Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele, retired British MI6 officer with expertise in Russian matters. 9. He described the finding seriously troubling evidence that he decided to share it with the FBI in July 2016, without permission of Fusion GPS. Steele delivered his report as a series of two- or three-page memos, starting in June 2016 and continuing through December. 10. He continued his investigation even after the Democratic client stopped paying for it following Trump's election. In October 2016, Steele compiled 33 pages and passed his findings to a reporter from Mother Jones magazine. https://t.co/D2NgxeMw09 11. Shortly after presidential election, John McCain met with former British ambassador to Moscow Andrew Wood who vouched for Steele's professionalism and integrity. 12. McCain obtained the dossier and took it directly to James Comey on December 9, 2016. Note, some in FBI already knew about the dossier since Steele had decided to share it with them. https://t.co/mO9CSH9wep 13. We also know that The FBI trusted Steele enough to consider paying him, but ended up not doing so in the end. Steele was familiar to the FBI, they had hired him to help a U.S. inquiry into alleged corruption in the world soccer organization FIFA. https://t.co/SNJnSrodTK 14. January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump included allegations that Russian operatives possess compromising personal and financial information about Trump. 15. Following the CNN report, BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier that it said was the basis of the briefing, including unverified claims that Russian operatives had collected \"embarrassing material\" involving Trump that could be used to blackmail him. 16. January 2017, Comey testified to Congress confirming Russian interference in 2016 election and confirmed ongoing investigation although he refused to comment on the Trump organization. 17. In March 2017 Comey finally confirmed that FBI was investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia and refuted Trump’s allegation that Obama administration that Obama Govt wiretapped him. https://t.co/rNyO3L5jlv 18. Trump's dismissal of Comey on came on May 9, 2017 after Deputy attorney general Rosenstein's memorandum said that the \"reputation and credibility\" of the FBI had been damaged under Comey's tenure. 19. The memo presented critical quotes from several former attorneys general in previously published op-eds; Rosenstein concluded that their \"nearly unanimous opinions\" were that Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was “wrong”. https://t.co/LHvYNzINXf 20. That brings us to the current state of affairs, with the circle of filth in full effect: Peter Strzok was having an affair with Lisa Page, both part of the SC.He texted anti-Trump messages while in the SC. He was also involved in interviewing Hillary https://t.co/CmTrmrNulU 21. Even before the formation of the SC, there have been concerns regarding FBI’s ability to stay impartial. Andrew McCabe’s wife was paid by DNC PAC’s and was close to Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe https://t.co/dE5J2Ak6zF 22. Now we find out that Dossier Author, British Christopher Steele was in contact with Obama Justice dept. associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr, who knew Steele and had repeated contacts with Steele when Steele was working on the dossier. https://t.co/swrVJFCIsW 23. James Rosen at Fox News reported Ohr was demoted (like Peter Strzok). Remember Ohr met after the election with Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, that hired Steele to compile dossier with funds supplied by Clinton campaign and DNC. https://t.co/RIhU08UW39 24. This just broke: Democrats were “peddling” salacious Trump dossier allegations to news reporters. DNC and Hillary denied ever knowing about the dossier, even after it was revealed that DNC funded it. Rachel Maddow reported it today, so it must be true https://t.co/hdWaIRBBu7 25. This Forbes article published Jan 13 2017 is by far the most astute reading of the dossier and why none of it likely to be factually accurate. There is a link to the actual dossier in the article if you are interested. https://t.co/PDX6gB3Di3 26. I will end with my Word for the day: “presstitute” which goes well with \"circle of filth\". Pressitution is how the circle of filth enlarges unchecked. I hope my effort provides increased clarity in a mostly opaque press reportage. 27. The intricate and unwieldy web that will implicate so many politicians and law enforcement officials will approach gargantuan proportions, likely becoming one of the biggest news stories ever. Consider this my humble contribution to its historical and future context. -Fin 28. Addendum: I have long held an unsubstantiated belief that the Imran Awan scandal is somehow connected to all of what is going on. The Wasserman-Hillary-Awan connection must lead to the Dossier, somehow. Here is one possible way. https://t.co/WsIEJRQjwR 29.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818418d"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"367"},"texto":"I had a police officer stationed in my high school. At one point he got a warrant to investigate me for a stolen calculator, that I didn’t steal. He kicked down my door after school one day with 8 other cops in riot gear with guns drawn on my Grandma. I ran upstairs and hid under the bed because I thought he was there to kill me. He took my computer, phone, and trashed my entire room as an officer held me and my grandmother in my kitchen at gun point. I was expected to go to school the next day with him there. I had to hold it all in. I had nightmares about it for years. I couldn’t focus in class, I was always terrified. The white kids were getting stickers from him as I feared for my life. I couldn’t get school work done the same as the other kids because I had no computer so I fell behind. This impacted which colleges I could go to. At one point he finally returned my items. I was obviously not charged. But he would constantly pull me out of class in a public manner and question me about the calculator. He would do so with my vice principle in the room. Eventually everyone knew I was always being talked to by the officer so it impacted my reputation and only enforced the stereotypes my white peers already held. Then, as I was in contention to become the captain of the track team, despite his efforts, he showed up at practice and handcuffed me in front of my coaches and teammates. He took me to jail where I sat for hours. My parents were on vacation, there was no one I could call. He then told me I was not under arrest but that he was trying to teach me a lesson. After that the coaches would not let me become captain, again impacting my college options. It also impacted which kids would risk associating with me. For some kids this means hanging out with kids who are actually committing crimes and falling into that life. I cannot state enough how terrified I was in school at all times. Every morning I wondered if he would arrest me at school. I saw him everyday. Every night when I was supposed to do homework, I was worried he would kick my door in again. Every knock on the door terrified me my entire life, up until this day. The funny thing is, I was not political at all before this. But this and other experiences I had with police throughout my life pushed me into fighting for justice. The police didn’t just harass me and my high school friends at school. It was just part of life being black in a white neighborhood. Being stopped at the age of 14 and asked why I’m in my own neighborhood... Or walking my dog and police pulling up and saying I was reported as a potential drug dealer by my own neighbors. Being thrown to the ground at 13 because I matched the description of someone who got in a fist fight. Being with my friend who was a recent rape victim when she saw her abuser and called the cops because she had a restraining order and police showing up and handcuffing me for their protection even though I wasn’t involved. I was 14. He Didn’t cuff the white kids around. Being stopped at 15 while walking down the street and drinking a water bottle because police said it looked like vodka. At 15... Being stopped at 16 while crossing the street because my pants were sagged and my backpack looked heavy so they thought I had a gun. This is just the life of a black kid. It’s just expected to be normal. It was the life of all my friends. We thought that was just life. We knew it didn’t happen to our white peers but we just thought it’s how it was. We thought we were flawed. So I say all this because these white school board members voting for more cops just don’t know what this all feels like. I will have this trauma for the rest of my life. It permanently messed me up. It ruined high school and narrowed my opportunities. I was just a kid. People of color already have the entire deck stacked against us but to then throw salt in the wound and have those officers sit in the room next to us and expect us to learn? The same ones who harass us all day in and out of school? And I didn’t even steal the damn calculator. I wasn’t the best kid. I smoked pot and cussed with my friends. But I knew white kids doing cocaine at 16. They had never had an interaction with police except when they got their damn stickers. Our white students feared detention, I feared arrest. To hear white people tell me that Officer was there for my protection is laughable. He was there to oppress people of color. And before you say I just had a bad cop, he quit being a police officer. He told me through a mutual friend that he quit because of me. He was horrified looking back at what he was forced to do to me. Idk what forced means in this context. Just what he said. Anyways, just writing this thread really fucking hurts. I am one of the lucky ones. This isn’t about safety this is about trauma that you are giving little kids. Just please don’t. @AmandaFritzRN @ChloeEudalyPDX @joannhardesty @tedwheeler please read this before you vote for more cops. I only added commissioner elect Hardesty and Commissioner Eudaly because they can use these stories as more fuel to convince their colleagues, I trust them. I didn’t add Nick Fish cuz I couldn’t find his twitter handle lol. Someone tag him. Fuck I’m literally still crying I can’t believe writing that shit was so hard for me. I’m so used to talking about whatever even personal stuff and never being nervous but this really cuts deep. I was so damn young. I was good. They really fucked me up y’all. I don’t even cry lol I didn’t expect this to blow up but since it did, there are things you can do. - pressure your local officials to remove officers from schools - uplift stories like these - support PoC activists and businesses we need y’all to use your privilege to help offset these stories. And when I say support I don’t just mean tweets. Buy from black owned businesses, donate to black and PoC orgs, compensate people for the work they are doing to change the world. My cash is $gregorymckelvey but there are people in your town too. Support them. We have to jump ten times higher to get to the same place.

Schools had to have runners go to classrooms instead of using designated call systems. It was safe. 7. That's a MAJOR tell folks. Do you imagine Russia, China, North Korea, or any of the rest of the \"enemies\" of America the fake news media tries to scare us about would've been that 'reserved' in a hit on the US system? But, it won't retract from eventually blaming them I bet! 8. I posted this thread on ties between HRC, BC, the CFoundation and the Chinese. The DJT wars against Huawei and ZTE spell out MAJOR EXPOSURE of #DeepState money, illegal campaign financing and a Chinese billionaire, James Riady and his LIPPO group. https://t.co/7yQatgtxvR 9. But man this is HUGE! CenturyLink, the group that got hit yesterday causing all of these outages, ARE MAJOR DEEP STATE! Folks, they have contracts for 911 services, hospital communications, prison systems and Dept of Defense (DOD) contracts for dark fiber communications. 10. They're also tied into lottery systems, schools, banking communications and more. Do any of you think that one company, having all that oversight and control is a responsible thing to do? They have a monopoly on the biggest communications systems in this country! 11. But, how exactly did they get all that control? Well, hold onto your sneakers. They have been steadily increasing their footprint and their control over nearly every single internet, phone, and communications provider in the US! They're massive! https://t.co/iKTqsd2F9A 12. But, who really controls them? Everybody knows, all decisions come from the top, right? Well...let's look at who OWNS CenturyLink. You're not going to believe this. Number one shareholder with 123+ million shares, worth $2.61 BILLION, is, Temasek holdings. Sound familiar? 13. It didn't strike me right away either until I realized Temasek is basically a shell corporation. It has OWNERSHIP investments in...Alibaba Group Holdings! Any idea who that is? You should! Alibaba Group Holdings was started with money from LIPPO's Riady family and friends. 14. Temasek also has ownership holdings in: CTL = CenturyLink. GILD = Gilead Sciences - a huge pharmaceutical corporation which is rumored to be tied to the tainted HIV medication the CFoundation and BC purchased with the help of Riady. It was sold to Africa and it killed people! 15. CenturyLink is co-controlled by Vanguard who have significant, if not controlling shares, of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Johnson and Johnson, and JP Morgan Chase bank! Are you getting the picture here folks? ALL DEEP STATE COMPANIES! CenturyLink is owned by our enemies! 16. Do you grasp what this means? The major and most vital communications systems in America. THE KESYTONE, is controlled by Deep State corporations! If you care to look at the stocks, holdings, values, and what not of these companies, check it out here. https://t.co/vtCi4qB0Ck 17. How big is CenturyLink? For 50 years they've bought into and taken over parts of or, all of, tons of communications suppliers in America. A monopoly! Started 50 years ago? That's when GHWB was liaison to China, then became CIA director! Humm... https://t.co/iKTqsd2F9A 18. Where did CenturyLink get all its government contracts and just how much do they control? This is where the monopolization gets scary. They're not just controlling American communications anymore. It's going worldwide! Look at this! They're everywhere! https://t.co/Ob8ajGJ3u8 19. Truth be told, even with all of their control, all their contracts, and all of their assets, are they really performing well enough to continue this monopolization? Some experts say they're not doing as well as regular investors like us would hope. https://t.co/W0R0nxGsKu 20. So, why in the world would they continue to be awarded contracts, move into bigger markets, and overtake more \"successful\" corporations like Verizon? Well, that's where this \"alternative agenda\" comes in and suggests the Deep State is doing this for a reason. Look at this! 21. \"Alibaba is kicking off its annual Alifest conference in Hangzhou, China next week with a star-studded lineup of speakers to help celebrate its 10th anniversary....Keynote presenters at the SME Summit include President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J. CFoundation...\" 22. WHAT THE HELL? Did you get that? I could leave it all right here and you would know I'm telling you the truth! The big dog himself, old slick willy, is partnered with the group that controls the major and critical communication systems of the US! https://t.co/nfXvSjf5Nj 23. @Americanlll found that essential and critical link. I told you, if you're not following him, you should be! There's a LOT of other big names in that line up including the CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz. I encourage more research into that if anyone has the time. 24. These massive corporations have fingers in nearly every country, working behind the scenes to control, to manipulate, and to MONITOR communications. What has POTUS and Q done? They've taken us to the back channels, they're rescuing the keystone. https://t.co/7T9CcRYq7Y 25. There's been a relentless effort to extend this monitoring and control by CenturyLink, aka, the Deep State, by our own government officials! CONGRESS issued the contracts to these players. EVERYTHING is monitored, recorded, controlled. Purposefully! https://t.co/T8BIa7PiMk 26. So what IS the keystone folks? It is our central ability to communicate, unrestricted. What does that sound like? Folks, the Keystone is...the 1st amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is the KEY that all other rights hinge on. It is our most precious right. 27. Those sons of bitches who control, manipulate, silence and otherwise prohibit our speech literally overtook our ability to communicate. The deep state infected the media which is no longer free speech, it is directed, controlled, and targeted to misinform and disrupt. 28. The #QAnon movement solidifies the backdoor channels to free speech lke what I'm doing right now. I'm doing my damnedest to research, learn, compile, and inform the rest of you. I will be shadow banned again, I will get hundreds of spam emails again. It shouldn't be that way. 29. Our 1st amendment right is the Keystone. The Founders knew it must be protected. Let your voice be known! Stand for what's free and what's right! God Bless! #WWG1WGA, #WAWY, #1stAmendment, #Keystone, #LibertyAtAllCosts - The End One of the greatest speeches ever made.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818418f"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"369"},"texto":"THREAD. I want to talk to you about what it was like to grow up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a Roman Catholic, and what's helpful or not helpful to say to folks/communities in times like there where yet another hideous ring of abuse has been exposed. I grew up in Scranton. It's a heavily Catholic town -- with parishes &amp; parish schools in every neighborhood (at least when I was still growing up), and with most families taking church really seriously. I know my family did. I missed church &lt;10x in my ENTIRE LIFE before college. I was, myself, a very visibly Catholic kid (I'm now athiest). I served the televised masses at St. Anne's Basilica, \"starred\" in the weekly children's mass on TV, attended Catholic school, sang in Catholic youth choirs, won the Bishop's Lay Award for my service to the church. And ya'll, I was around these men. Several of the listed men. And I loved them, and I trusted them. And while I will never excuse what they did, I need to explain to you why saying \"Screw these pedo priests\" is not only unhelpful (even to me, who disdains the church) but cruel. In Scranton, there's no small amount of \"ethnic segregation.\" No, not referring to racism -- referring to ethnic tribalism. Neighborhoods are steeped in ethnicity: Minooka/Irish, West/Italian, South/German, East/Slovac, Moosic/Polish. Churches supported specific communities. My 1st church, St. Mary Czestochowa, is 1 block from my parents' house. 1 block the other direction is my dad's childhood home. He attended SMC all his life until we switched to a nearby Irish parish (then St. Joe's, now Divine Mercy) because I started singing the masses there. These ethnic churches are bastions of ties to Old World communities that represent so much more than any God. They were places old languages were kept alive. Old lullabyes from old countries. Traditional foods. Traditional customs. Ways of life that were carried across oceans. I remember growing up in SMC. The smell of Polish foods cooking in the church basement during my Sunday classes. Learning about Poland. The soft sound of elderly Polish women singing and talking in Polish, teaching us Christmas Carols and Polish swear words. Keeping Poland alive. The Church made my family's history real. We are nearly completely Polish, and my engagement in SMC even as a child blurred together my ethnicity, my identity and sense of history, my understanding of god, my understanding of my family. It was never just about \"the church.\" The church was both a spiritual \"Jesus\" community and a spiritual \"Polish\" community. It was a family that sustained itself and its members through lore, love, shared memory, a sense of purpose and identity that seemed frozen so beautifully in time amidst a modernized world. When I wasn't at my home church, I attended Catholic School. St. Mary's Assumption, then Marian Catholic. I loved those schools, where nuns taught some of the classes &amp; priests were teachers, coaches, chaperones, mentors, friends. Religious people were the fabric of my education. I sang in a Catholic School youth choir, and we performed each year in Cathedral Capers -- a cabaret showcasing the musical talents of nuns, priests, and various Catholics of the diocese. It. Was. SO. Fun. I can still remember how hard Fr. Altavilla made me laugh. He was so kind. Between Capers, and Catholic School, and my involvement at St. Anne's doing the televised masses, I. Met. A. Lot. Of. Priests. I worked closely with them. Traveled with them. Laughed with them. Looked up to them. Loved them. In the trusting way that young people do. And I know multiple men who have now been accused. And my heart breaks. Not for me -- they didn't touch me -- but for the communities they served, and the sense of \"living church\" they destroyed. They traumatized children. They LIED. They covered up lies. They kept lying. I grieve the sacred, historical groups they shattered -- no, not the Roman/Vatican kind -- the Polish kind, the German kind, the Irish kind. I grieve the shattered communities of lost languages, special foods, memories of safety and belonging. I grieve the loss of identity. I grieve the warm, safe feeling I had about St. Mary Czestochowa's summer picnic, running through the dark alleyway to my house with my little cousin, bellies full of halupki, excited to announce we won a raffle. I grieve saying \"Zimno!\" when it's cold. I grieve, and grieve. These priests shattered children. They shattered communities, families, connections to worlds we rapidly lose each day we become a little more \"just American,\" &amp; a little less Polish, or Slovac, or German, etc -- those aspects of ethnicity that create identity, value, a home. I lost some part of my stake in this when I saw Fr. Homer named. Fr. Homer was the last pastor I knew at St. Mary Czestochowa. I shook his hand every Sunday for years. I can't look at those years the same. I wept when I saw Fr. Altavilla, Fr. Paulish. Men I knew and loved. To be clear: I don't think my losses rival that of their victims. I don't think explaining the Catholic Church's cultural significance in a Blue Collar town will convince most of you that the Church matters. It's OK if you don't think that. But here's what I do need you to know. When you say \"The Church is disgusting,\" you are maligning more than pedophiles, more than corrupt Bishops like James Timlin. When you call all priests rapists, you malign more than those men who are. When you roll your eyes about another Catholic Church scandal, you hurt me. When you roll your eyes at yet more hurt, you hurt me/others like me whose childhoods, adulthoods, souls, memories are wrapped up in the difficult/painful legacies these men left behind. You hurt my connection to Poland. You hurt my memories of Baptisms, Confirmations, funerals. It is too easy and too simple to think that the Catholic Church only keeps the god-souls of its flock alive. No. The Catholic Church I knew was a living god, a human collection of souls, a place of connection to one another and to a cultural identity we were losing in America. The Catholic Church I grew up in was representative of a human soul. Not just one that loved Jesus, but one that loved Polish carols and homemade pierogi and pascha bread and family crests and cursing in Yiddish and babcis and families and a home that was both here AND there. I DO NOT EXCUSE THESE HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY MEN I LOVED. I don't ask you to. But when you insult the church writ large in response to these crimes, know that the emotional EXPERIENCE of church is distinct from the ORGANIZATION of church, for many. Know that my sweet grandmothers knitting quilts in church basements and straightening their grandson's ties are not the acts of Bishop Timlin nor his priests. Know that the church-as-community is where Catholicism lives, for Catholics, not the church-as-Vatican or church-as-law. And know that no matter HOW many times another sexual violence ring is exposed, it is not \"old news\" to the children-now-grownups who have awoken to see their heroes dethroned and destroyed and unrecognizable. It's not old news. It hurts fresh, it hurts raw, it hurts real. So in the rush to glibly deride Catholics, Catholicism, the Church, etc. in the wake of scandal, I just ask that you limit your vitriol to the criminals themselves and I ask that you consider how they've shattered children, yes, but communities too. And that there's such grief. It isn't old news to anyone who grew up in a Catholic town. Our very childhoods are pulverized, even if no priest laid his hands on us. Our hearts are broken. Spare us your glib vitriol long enough to let us grieve the loss of men we thought we knew, men we thought we loved. These priests and their enablers deserve the worst of what comes to them. I do not condone them. I do not forgive them. I am enraged by all they have broken. I am enraged by what we lose every time we drift further from communities where we should have felt safe. I hope in your calls for justice, you can remember that their wreckage extends beyond known victims. Please. I hope you can know that when you malign Catholicism writ large, you're maligning so much more than you intend. The Church is bleeding out its poison. Allow us our grief.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"923893094810079232"},"id_str":"923893094810079232","name":"Karen Moroski, PhD","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"8405"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2660"},"created_at":"Fri Oct 27 12:44:13 +0000 2017","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"7886"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"30"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"163"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1483"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"5"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"49"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.8869"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"1"}}

There's a myriad of seemingly disconnected dots amid the story of the DOJ and FBI spying on candidate Trump. But oddly no-one asks raw questions... 3. For instance. Why did ODNI Dan Coats decide to declassify a FISA Court opinion in April and May 2017 ?.. What was Coats motivation for a historic shift in transparency of FISA court material ?... https://t.co/MdJqgpl6wh 4. Why put this into the sunlight if there was not a bigger reason to do so? https://t.co/SvQRK9hzjv Seriously. Simple question. Why declassify it? https://t.co/rFhbArP7CT 5. Additionally... How/Why do we discover Peter Strzok? Why was there a media release about this FBI agent in December? What's the purpose? https://t.co/wvYGSZtDNj https://t.co/fsYytLCcky 6. Where did this story originate, and why did the entity who released the story wish the public to know about it? https://t.co/QhPmC8yHFh 7. Why did an anonymous somebody tell the media Peter Strzok was the FBI agent who interviewed General Michael Flynn, three days before Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators? https://t.co/SV7E0sThml 8. Why was it important to anonymous *somebodies* that we know about Peter Strzok and DOJ/FBI lawyer Lisa Page. https://t.co/DQkjwAPrLN 9. Why was it important for people inside the intelligence community to tell the public, anonymously, that Lisa Page and Peter Strzok were conspiring to assist Hillary Clinton and eliminate candidate Donald Trump? 10. Why was it important for the public to know that Agent Peter Strzok and Attorney Lisa Page changed the wording on the FBI talking points that James Comey used to exonerate candidate Hillary Clinton? https://t.co/2LaTSr8kaa 11. Who, inside the intelligence community, was pushing out that information? What was the intention of pushing out that information? Why did they think the public needed to know about it? https://t.co/aja5618tFl 12. Why did they need to tell the American public that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were no longer in a position to influence current investigative events? Why was that important to the intelligence community? 13. All reporting on Strzok and Page pushes the media to inquire back to the DOJ Public Information Officer for comment on the media reporting. https://t.co/QhPmC8yHFh 14. The DOJ responds to the questions from the media by referring all inquiry to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Michael Horowitz. Who tells media: https://t.co/QhPmC8yHFh https://t.co/8npzFLRxh6 15. The response from the OIG, to the December 2017 media inquiry, forces THIS to the sunlight: https://t.co/YvZzIyDMfA https://t.co/wvuQH7vjFh 16. Immediately following the news of a Michael Flynn indictment release, a blitzkrieg of parallel randomly stories surfaces. Including https://t.co/8d3qHNaL6g 17. Litterally at the same time an indictment against Flynn is announced. Someone within the intelligence community hits back with information about more DOJ corruption; this time DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr: https://t.co/8d3qHNaL6g https://t.co/vtDniv5nQg 18. Why? What's going on? Why is the IC hitting back hard against Robert Mueller's team outcome, by releasing damaging information about those who have participated inside the Mueller investigation? Who is punching back? It's not the media. This is insider justice stuff. https://t.co/j8ptMa3El3 19. This part of the intelligence community is transparently pissed off. They keep striking out pummeling the Mueller team. Why? Who are they? And they don't let up... https://t.co/7yCmAumkg1 20. Whoever *they* are, inside this IC writ large, is not just hitting out - they are naming names. They've named: Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Andrew \"Andy\" McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, Glenn Simpson, and they don't let up. https://t.co/7yCmAumkg1 21. Not only do they name names, but they actually provide physical evidence that goes along with those names. Text messages between the participants: https://t.co/ZXRGO3ngXH 22. It just seems odd that no-one ever asked WHY? Why is it important to these people to put this information out. Up until December 2017 almost all leaks were against the office of the presidency. These are against IC Officials. 23. This series of coordinated stories distributed to the media are not random occurrences. The frequency and timing is too well coordinated. The MSM are forced to cover them - even though they don't want to. But no-one in MSM asks WHY? Why are these IC reports coming out? 24. And the deluge of IC push-back doesn't let up. Two days after James Baker accompanies Andrew McCabe to a House hearing BOOM he's nailed too. https://t.co/ykkh7yZxz2 25. Less than a day after Intel Chairman Nunes tells the media of his intention to question FBI lead counsel James Baker https://t.co/EWOWTFAMEp WHAMMO !! Baker is defrocked, put in charge of counting staplers, and exposed as a leaker. https://t.co/eWct9CxdM8 https://t.co/e0GqkqZ1Lj 26. All of this happens in a matter of a stunning two weeks +/- a few days. Yet, no-one seems to ask why? Why then? Why was it important to *someone* to get this information out, get these people exposed, and get this into the media bloodstream. 27. Not a single one of the stories around Strzok, Page, Comey, B Ohr, or N Ohr, Simpson, McCabe, or Baker was real-time information attached to their current activity. All of the information was as they are quarantined. Yet it all came out in a two week period. Why? 28. I just find it interesting that no-one in MSM is looking at the reason we are able to put all of this together. The story, and scale, of corruption inside the FBI and DOJ is obviously important to someone inside the FBI and DOJ. https://t.co/glBz1DOGCL 29. And whoever it is, for whatever motive they have, they have presented a ton of evidence preparing us for something rather significant. It's remarkable how much the MSM is ignoring it. https://t.co/dhUVlXZxK1 30.

CrowdStrike co-founder George Kurtz said at the time, “We wish Steve and the rest of the Commissioners every success in this important effort.

BOOTSTRAPPING “This means the FBI and DOJ, and all of the downstream claims by the intelligence apparatus; including the December 2016 Joint Analysis Report and January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, all the way to the Weissmann/Mueller report and the continued claims therein; were based on the official intelligence agencies of the U.S. government and the U.S. Department of Justice taking the word of a hired contractor for the Democrat party….. despite their inability to examine the server and/or actually see an unredacted technical forensic report from the investigating contractor.” This technique of framing a case is called BOOTSTRAPPING.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"1102925786829357056"},"id_str":"1102925786829357056","name":"Incarnated_ET","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"13102"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"502"},"created_at":"Tue Mar 05 13:36:13 +0000 2019","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"5723"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"31"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"10236"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"23648"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"330"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"763"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.11233"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

The mandate, by itself, suffices. https://t.co/QGlVx6QQ6I 3/ Moreover, a decision for the Plaintiffs would \"free\" them from mandate, so causation and redressability are satisfied. https://t.co/KvBhWwqII1 4/ Next, the Court followed the reasoning of NFIB to conclude that the individual mandate, without the penalty, is unconstitutional. https://t.co/ZtcHFy0GVf 5/ The Court draws the important distinction: the mandate and the penalty are different statutory provisions. Cong exempted some ppl from penalty, but not mandate. This fact shows that the unpenalized mandate has force. Many critics of this decision do not recognize this fact https://t.co/QswIlmKpUZ 6/ Congress in 2010 (ACA) and 2017 (TCJA) treated mandate and penalty as separate provisions. https://t.co/PcV2Q8RoRr 7/ The Court also rejects the intervenor's argument that the penalty from 2018 will continue to generate revenue for years to come, because people may delay paying that exaction. https://t.co/p4WtcFYxou 8/ Because the mandate no longer triggers a tax, it cannot be saved under the Taxing Power. https://t.co/tmzFquyniP 9/ Judge O'Connor also reaches an important point that many critics reject: a mandate, without a penalty, still \"has an enormous influence on social norms and individual conduct in society.\" https://t.co/bLO0HASZtx 10/ In conclusion, the Court found that \"the Individual Mandate, unmoored from a tax, is unconstitutional\" https://t.co/4plju6KVTz 11/ Next, the Court turns to severability--the most difficult aspect of the case. The parties disagree on which intent controls \"the 2010 Congress that passed the ACA or the 2017 Congress that passed the TCJA.\" I address this question in my new article: https://t.co/OZsgtyYHUS https://t.co/1XjVJnuer9 12/ The Court concludes that it doesn't matter which Congress's intent controls. \"the Court finds both Congresses manifested the same intent: The Individual Mandate is inseverable from the entire ACA\" https://t.co/VeeBouZ9LI 13/ The strongest indication of Congress's 2010 intent was in the findings (part of the statute) which were not repealed. https://t.co/MtLfc9W7Dv 14/ J. O'Connor notes DOJ took same position here, as it did in NFIB: GI and CR are not severable from mandate. However, he notes that many NFIB amici now take a different position. \"But that was then, and this is now.\" https://t.co/cVzCECK5dP 15/ J. O'Connor cites NFIB and King v. Burwell to show that \"Individual Mandate is inseverable from the entirety of the ACA\" (with a citation to @RandyEBarnett) https://t.co/5EmePfTqAe 16/ The Court concludes that \"That requirement—the Individual Mandate— was essential to the ACA’s architecture.\" Therefore, it is inseverable from rest of law. Here, Judge O'Connor quotes from #Unprecedented about the death spiral that will result in a mandate-less ACA https://t.co/drb7ukKORZ 17/ The Court also notes that a mandate-less ACA is an entirely new law, which would shift costs for uncompensated care. (Here, he cites #Unprecedented again) https://t.co/RByrWi6dZP 18/ In sum, the Court finds that the 2010 Congress would not have enacted the ACA but for the ACAs. This conclusion is consistent with the NFIB joint dissent, and implied by the RBG opinion. https://t.co/vfGTVIxbiV 19/ The far more important aspect of the opinion focuses on the intent of Congress in 2017. J. O'Connor explains that due to the reconciliation process, Congress could not have had an intent about the mandate. https://t.co/V90oKd5Mvs 20/ In 2017, Congress did not repeal the individual mandate. Therefore, 2017 Congress \"intended to preserve the Individual Mandate because the 2017 Congress, like the 2010 Congress, knew that provision is essential to the ACA\" https://t.co/IdROACxLrA 21/ Second, 2017 Congress did not (and could not) repeal statutory findings that mandate was \"essential\" to ACA https://t.co/4leG8dXsbx 22/ Third, the Court recognizes the key limitation on the 2017-intent argument: because of the reconcliation rules, Congress could not--and did not--modify the intent of the 2010 Congress. https://t.co/47gPdkaFbV 23/ Finally, the Court rejects the intervenor's alternative argument: if 2017 Tax Cut law rendered the mandate is unconstitutional, then the correct remedy is to declare the Tax Cut unconstitutional. Here, the court adopts my argument in #Undone https://t.co/OZsgtyYHUS https://t.co/uGNyfbcF7P 24/ Five points to respond to common criticisms. First, the text of the ACA distinguishes between the mandate and the shared responsibility payment. The law describes only the former as \"essential\" to the ACA. The mandate survives TCJA 25/ Second, Congress in 2017 could not, and did not repeal the individual mandate. If the Republicans had 60 votes, they would have taken that step, but couldn't. This reality demonstrates that the intent was to leave the individual mandate in place. 26/ Third, the most intuitive answer is that the intent of Congress in 2017 matters, not the intent of Congress in 2010. Severability doctrine must consider whether, and how Congress in 2017 modified the law. See point #2 above. 27/ Fourth, the joint opinion in NFIB expressly found the mandate could not be severed from the rest of the ACA. The other opinions suggested as much. And King v. Burwell reaffirmed that linkage. 28/ Fifth, J. O'Connor stopped short of entering a nationwide injunction (a refreshing change of pace). We only have a grant of summary judgment. Now, this issue can percolate up to #SCOTUS in the usual course. 29/ One final point. President Trump quickly opined on the matter in two tweets: https://t.co/wfCDgOxFR2 30/ Here, we do not have an Obama Judge or a Trump judge, but a highly respected judge https://t.co/VqujmlynJv 31/ The third book in the Obamacare trilogy continues to write itself.

But he called their bluff. https://t.co/3QaDZfv9be The mainstream media has attacked President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as impulsive, blindsiding his own national security team. But detailed, published accounts of the policy process over the course of the year tell a very different story. They show that senior national security officials and self-interested institutions have been playing a complicated political game for months aimed at keeping Trump from wavering on our indefinite presence on the ground in Syria. The entire episode thus represents a new variant of a familiar pattern dating back to Vietnam in which national security advisors put pressure on reluctant presidents to go along with existing or proposed military deployments in a war zone. The difference here is that Trump, by publicly choosing a different policy, has blown up their transparent schemes and offered the country a new course, one that does not involve a permanent war state. The relationship between Trump and his national security team has been tense since the beginning of his administration. By mid-summer 2017, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joseph Dunford had become so alarmed at Trump’s negative responses to their briefings justifying global U.S. military deployments that they decided to do a formal briefing at the Pentagon. But when Mattis and Dunford sang the praises of the “rules-based, international democratic order” that has “kept the peace for 70 years,” Trump simply shook his head in disbelief. By the end of that year, however, Mattis, Dunford, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed they’d succeeded in getting Trump to use U.S. troops not only to defeat ISIS but to “stabilize” the entire northeast sector of Syria and balance Russian and Iranian-sponsored forces. Yet they ignored warning signs of Trump’s continuing displeasure with their vision of a more or less permanent American military presence in Syria. In a March rally in Ohio ostensibly about health care reform, Trump suddenly blurted out, “We’re coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon—very soon we’re coming out.” Then in early April 2018, Trump’s impatience with his advisors on Syria boiled over into a major confrontation at a National Security Council meeting, where he ordered them unequivocally to accept a fundamentally different Syria deployment policy. Trump opened the meeting with his public stance that the United States must end its intervention in Syria and the Middle East more broadly. He argued repeatedly that the U.S. had gotten “nothing” for its efforts, according to an account published by the AP. When Dunford asked him to state exactly what he wanted, Trump answered that he favored an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces and an end to the “stabilization” program in Syria. Mattis responded that an immediate withdrawal from Syria was impossible to carry out responsibly, would risk the return of Islamic State, and would play into the hands of Russia, Iran, and Turkey, whose interests ran counter to those of the United States. Trump reportedly then relented and said they have could five or six months to destroy the Islamic State. But he also made it clear that he did not want them to come back to him in October and say that they had been unable to defeat ISIS and had to remain in Syria. When his advisors reiterated that they didn’t think America could withdraw responsibly, Trump told them to “just get it done.” Trump’s national security team had prepared carefully for the meeting in order to steer him away from an explicit timetable for withdrawal. They brought papers that omitted any specific options for withdrawal timetables. Instead, as the detailed AP account shows, they framed the options as a binary choice—either an immediate pullout or an indefinite presence in order to ensure complete and permanent defeat of ISIS The leave option was described as risking a return of ISIS and leaving a power vacuum for Russia and Iran to fill. Such a binary strategy had worked in the past, according to admin sources. That would account for Trump’s long public silence on Syria during the early months of 2018 while then-SOS Tillerson and Mattis were articulating detailed arguments for a long-term military commitment. Another reason the approach had been so successful, however, was that Trump had made such a big issue out of Barack Obama giving the Pentagon a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan. As a result, he was hesitant to go public with a similar request for a Syria timetable. A DoD official who had been briefed on the meeting “rejected that any sort of timeline was discussed.” Furthermore the official asserted that Mattis “was not asked to draw up withdrawal options….” Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Chiefs, also told reporters, “the president has actually been very good in not giving us a specific timeline.” Nevertheless, without referring to a timeline, the White House issued a short statement saying that the U.S. role in Syria was coming to a “rapid end.” Mattis and Dunford were consciously exploiting Trump’s defensiveness about a timeline to press ahead with their own strategy unless and until Trump publicly called them on it. That is what finally happened some weeks after Trump’s six month deadline had passed. The claim by Trump advisors that they were taken by surprise was indeed disingenuous. What happened last week was that Trump followed up on the clear policy he had laid down in April. The Syria withdrawal affair is a dramatic illustration of the fundamental quandary of the Trump presidency in regard to ending the state of permanent war that previous administrations created. Although a solid majority of Americans want to rein in U.S. military deployments in the Middle East and Africa, Trump’s national security team is committed to doing the opposite. Trump is now well aware that it is virtually impossible to carry out the foreign policy that he wants without advisors who are committed to the same objective. That means that he must find people who have remained outside the system during the permanent war years while being highly critical of its whole ideology and culture. If he can fill key positions with truly dissident figures, the last two years of this term in office could decisively clip the wings of the bureaucrats and generals who have created the permanent war state we find ourselves in today.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2502895924"},"id_str":"2502895924","name":"Jewhadi™","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"63063"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"39259"},"created_at":"Wed Apr 23 00:33:48 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"283590"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"32"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"327"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"562"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"10"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"18"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.85803"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Anger"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

Biden also used the threat of withholding a billion dollars in American loan guarantees to pressure Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor general. 3) President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, @RudyGiuliani , recently said “keep your eye on Ukraine.” https://t.co/Jcbk8TcSsq 4) ~Feb. 4, 2014, Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt appeared to be discussing the ouster of Ukrainian President Yanukovych and the installation of opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk as prime minister. 5) Biden was discussed as being willing to help cement changeover in Ukraine. On Feb. 22, 2014, Yanukovych was removed as President of Ukraine and fled to Russia. On Feb. 27 2014, Yatsenyuk, the candidate favored by Nuland, was installed as Prime Minister of Ukraine. 6) On April 18, 2014, Hunter Biden was appointed to the Board of Directors for Burisma. Four days later, on April 22 2014, Vice President Biden traveled to Ukraine, offering his political support and $50 million in aid for Yatsenyuk’s shaky new government. 7) Biden helped Ukraine to obtain a four-year $17.5 billion IMF package in March 2015. Biden also played a role in the removal of Ukraine’s general prosecutor, Victor Shokin. 8) Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. Shokin had been investigating Burisma, the company that Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of, at the time of his firing. https://t.co/h9zOtdOW67 9) Burisma is owned by the former Minister of Ecology for Ukraine, Nikolai Zlochevsky (also known as Mykola Zlochevsky). According to Front News, Zlochevsky issued a “special permit for the extraction of a third of the gas produced in Ukraine” to his own company, Burisma. 10) In the spring of 2014, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office opened an investigation at the behest of the UK prosecutors office, which was investigating money laundering allegations against Zlochevsky and had just frozen $23.5 million in assets. 11) Around the same time that Zlochevsky’s assets were being frozen in the UK, Burisma appointed Hunter Biden to its board on April 18, 2014. Per the Hill, Hunter Biden’s firm received regular payments—“usually more than $166,000 a month”—from Burisma. https://t.co/aPKbtMpOdT 12) Ukrainian prosecutors refused to provide the UK with needed documents and in January 2015 a British court ordered the assets unfrozen. On Feb. 10, 2015, Shokin was appointed as the prosecutor general of the Ukraine and he picked up the investigation into Burisma. 13) Shokin was portrayed as fumbling a major corruption case. In late 2015, the US pushed for Shokin’s removal and Biden led the effort by personally threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. Shokin was removed by Poroshenko shortly thereafter, in early 2016. 14) The Hill’s article included a written answer from Shokin, who told Solomon that his investigation into Burisma had included plans for “interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.” 15) In January 2016, top Ukrainian corruption prosecutors and officials from Obama’s National Security Council (NSC), FBI, State Department and Department of Justice (DOJ), would meet in Washington, according to an April 26 article by The Hill. 16) The meeting reportedly addressed the revival of a closed investigation into payments to U.S. figures from Ukraine’s Russia-backed Party of Regions and the closure of an ongoing Ukrainian investigation into Burisma Holdings. https://t.co/gA2yc2o9At 17) A Jan. 22 NABU press release confirmed that NABU Director Artem Sytnyk was in Washington, D.C., from Jan. 19-21 for a working visit. At the same time as the NABU meeting with Obama officials, Vice President Joe Biden also met with senior Ukrainian officials. 18) On Jan. 21, 2016, Biden met with Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine. Just six days earlier, on Jan 15, 2016, Biden had met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman - promising to commit $220 million in new assistance to Ukraine that year. https://t.co/y3wiNlNLFO 19) In May 2016, Sytnyk and Ukrainian Member of Parliament Leshchenko would publicly disclose the contents of the Ukrainian “black ledger” to the media, which later implicated Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort. The revelation would force Manafort from the campaign. 20) Leshchenko served as a source for various individuals, including journalist Michael Isikoff and DNC operative Alexandra Chalupa. Leshchenko also served as a direct source of information for Fusion GPS—and Nellie Ohr. https://t.co/GbtFVEMDup 21) In December 2018, a Kyiv court ruled that Sytnyk and Leshchenko “acted illegally when they revealed that Manafort’s surname and signature were found in the so-called “black ledger” of ousted President Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions.” https://t.co/NP2NlqSRqy 22) Also in Jan '16 Alexandra Chalupa told a senior DNC official there was a Russian connection with the Trump campaign. Chalupa also told the official to expect Manafort’s involvement. How Chalupa knew to expect Manafort’s involvement with the Trump campaign remains unknown. 23) As previously reported, on May 30, 2016, Nellie Ohr sent an email to her husband, DOJ official Bruce Ohr and three other DOJ officials, alerting them of the discovery of the “Reported Trove of Documents on Ukrainian Party of Regions’ ‘Black Cashbox.’” https://t.co/GbtFVEMDup 24) NABU was formally established in October 2014 but took over a year to actually become a functioning unit. During this time, NABU officials began establishing a relationship with the FBI. 25) In early 2016, NABU director Artem Sytnyk announced that his bureau was very close to signing a Memorandum of cooperation with the FBI and by February 2016, the FBI had had a permanent representative onsite at the NABU offices. 26) Sytnyk met with US Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt to discuss a more formalized relationship with the FBI and on June 30, 2016, NABU and the FBI entered into a Memorandum of Understanding that allowed for an FBI office onsite at NABU offices. 27) NABU has repeatedly refused to make the Memorandum of Understanding with the FBI public and went to court in 2018 to prevent its release. In Dec. 2017, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko accused Sytnyk of allowing the FBI to conduct illegal operations in Ukraine. 28) Lutsenko called for an audit of NABU, claiming to “possess information of interest to the auditors” and was pushing for Sytnyk’s resignation. According to reporting by Euromaiden Press, Lutsenko’s efforts failed “thanks to the reaction from Ukraine’s American partners.” 29) On April 11, 2019, Greg Craig, Obama’s former White House counsel and a partner at Skadden was indicted for lying about and concealing his work in Ukraine. 30) Craig, who reportedly worked closely with Manafort, was paid more than $4 million to produce a report justifying the conviction of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Notably, Craig’s name was not included in the “Black Ledger” leak from Leshchenko and Sytnyk. 31) Craig publicly stated that “it was Doug Schoen who brought this project to me, and he told me he was acting on behalf of Victor Pinchuk.\" Pinchuk denied any involvement. 32) FARA documents filed by lobbyist Doug Schoen showed that he was paid $40,000 a month by Victor Pinchuk in part to arrange meetings for Ukrainian Parliamentarian Olga Bielkov. Schoen also helped Pinchuk establish ties with the Clinton Foundation. 33) Reports filed by the Clinton Foundation indicate that Pinchuk donated between $10 to $25 million to the Clinton organization. Pinchuk also has ties to Serhiy Leshchenko, the Ukrainian member of parliament who leaked the information on Manafort. /End","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"792096589191852033"},"id_str":"792096589191852033","name":"Jeff Carlson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"37991"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"314"},"created_at":"Fri Oct 28 20:11:58 +0000 2016","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"19393"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"33"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"4112"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7966"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"125"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"241"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.30912"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

(THREAD) 2) Our #FreePress never challenges Democrats on their talking points. Only Republicans get this 'privilege'. @AdamSchiffCA is on TV all day talking about how their is proof of #Collusion, but we've yet to see ANY. Anchors just sit back and listen to the narrative of the day. 3) Anyone anti-Trump gets to make the rounds everywhere spouting nonsense against @POTUS. You'd think a #FreePress would of learned after Wolfe's book backfired, but instead... Here's comes @OMAROSA who gets more insane with each interview. 4) After the FL shooting, our #FreePress used kids like David Hogg as political pawns. They were allowed to spew hatred towards gun owners and were clearly uninformed about the #2A. The media could hide behind them because they were victims. This was done ON PURPOSE. Propaganda. 5) When our #FreePress did show the other side, it was at a Town Hall that felt more like the \"Two Minutes Of Hate\" from 1984. @DLoesch played the role of Emmanuel Goldstein that night. And the #MSM acted like this was all completely normal. https://t.co/NZsImIpamx 6) A #FreePress would be covering the assault accusations against DNC Deputy Head Keith Ellison with the same energy that they did with Rob Porter, who most Americans didn't even know of, But Porter worked 4 Trump so the story was endlessly covered for weeks. Double standard. 7) A #FreePress would cover both sides of the illegal immigration debate. Yet, zero time is given to the victims of illegal immigrant crime. Nevermind that the MAJORITY of Americans agree more with Trump on the issue than the Democrats. See Harvard/Harris poll. 8) A #FreePress would not use a picture from 2014 to cover the mostly manufactured Trump's putting \"kids in cages\" narrative. They would also correctly point out to viewers that this happened under Obama as well. https://t.co/kMSvhsTUww 9) A #FreePress wouldn't make themselves the story. Watch a White House Press Briefing and tell me what you're seeing isn't Leftist activism posing as journalism. Dont want 2 be called #FakeNews? Don't report #FakeNews. Respect from the public is earned. https://t.co/LpFfNQ57Gu 10) A #FreePress would not be justifying the tactics and violence of #Antifa towards Trump supporters, the police, &amp; even journalists. @ChrisCuomo They would be showing how these tactics are actually those of FASCISTS. I guess the name of this thuggish group duped them all? 🤔 11) Remember when the #FreePress was crying that they were afraid of violence from Trump supporters because we heckle them? When they actually get attacked by #Antifa they let it slide. Nothing to see here. How many Democrats have even been asked about #Antifa by the media? 12) A #FreePress wouldnt look like star struck teenagers covering one of the Presidential candidates in the 2016 election. Hint: It wasnt Trump. https://t.co/giYyoethsA 13) A #FreePress would of dug into the 2016 polls &amp; looked at the data. They would of reported how slanted they all were. Instead they used them to craft the Left's political narrative. They wanted to depress Trump's base to decrease turnout. How is this not election meddling? 14) Kasie Hunt, actually let slip the truth abt the 2016 election. \"Hillary's campaign doesnt feel like a winning one\" A Trump rally was like a rock concert. A Hillary rally was like a funeral. This was the reality of 2016. The #FreePress knew this, but still pushed the \"polls\" 15) Here's the clip mentioned above. https://t.co/Ld228zls9S 16) Has the #FreePress shifted their take since the election? Only for a day. Then they went into \"muh Russia\" to help cover for the Establishments epic loss at the hands of \"We The People\". One day of self reflection. Pathetic. It was then onto destroying Trump AT ALL COST. 17) As and we lead up to the midterms, the #FreePress is back to pushing the same bullshit polls hoping to get a different effect than the previous time. The #BlueWave is a DNC narrative pushed by the same media hacks and pundits who got 2016 completely wrong. 18) The #FreePress has kept all the same pundits, reporters, anchors who PROVED that they dont have the pulse of the people. But the #MSM is not about news. They are about SHAPING PUBLIC PERCEPTION. And the more they fail at it, the more insane their coverage of Trump gets. 19) Remember the #FreePress's reaction to this tweet from @realDonaldTrump They all nervously laughed and said he was crazy. What a kook! https://t.co/FQs1uy6sWR 20) Then once he was proven right, they turned the narrative into: \"Trump should want the FBI spying on him..\" \"This is all completely normal in a Presidential campaign\" Total 180 on a story that reporters should of been chomping at the bit to get to the bottom of. No interest 21) A #FreePress is supposed to be skeptical of the Intel agencies. Iraq War anyone? 22) There is such overwhelming evidence of #SpyGate and how Obama's Intel agencies basically initiated a coup against @POTUS with the help of BOTH PARTIES. Biggest story in our country's history. Watergate is shit compared to this. But their job is not to dig, its to cover up. 23) A #FreePress doesn't report that the MLK bust was removed when it wasn't. That Trump's FL rally had no one there when the pic was from hours before it started. That Melania is in hiding and being physically abused, when it reality she was recovering from surgery. https://t.co/90uLLnU8N4 24) A #FreePress would be all over the Podesta's emails. They would of asked WTF is #SpiritCooking and what kind of sick bastard is into that. NOT ONE REPORTER asked this of Podesta. I'm sure some wanted to. But the execs won't have it - because we have a #FreePress I guess. 25) Imagine the #FreePress coverage of Trump's campaign if his manager was involved in this satanic #SpiritCooking shit. We'd still be hearing about it. https://t.co/W4QZgvv9UL Did the #FreePress report on and dig into the OBVIOUS code words being used in Podestas emails. Forget for a second what many believe they mean. The FACT is the people in these emails are using code. Imagine if Trump's manager asked the question at the bottom of this email 👇 https://t.co/4UuiAWV23y 27) W/O getting into a whole side issue, its disturbing how nothing was ever mentioned about all the odd stuff in those emails. They plucked a couple about Hillary's open borders speeches. If Podesta worked for Trump, again, the #FreePress would still be going thru them all. 28) Lastly, in light of the sick and evil Catholic Church child rape scandal: Why don't the #FreePress work their asses off to save kids who are being trafficked and abused? This goes way beyond the Church. This involves Hollywood, Politics, the Fortune 500, NGO/Foundations. 29) The amount of pedo busts since Trump got in has been incredible. And yet, our #FreePress barely mentions them, if at all. And when they do, its only local affiliates that do. Its all very telling.... The reason? 30) Our #FreePress is there only to protect those the Establishment wants protected. Powerful people are covered for, and when they get exposed it gets treated as a one off. Weinstein is the face of Hollywood, stories are written, then all is forgotten. 31) A #FreePress should know that guys like Weinstein are just the tip of the iceberg. Yet, Hollywood degeneracy is out of the headlines. BY DESIGN. 32) To sum up, our #FreePress is not free. It is pure propaganda for the Left &amp; Democrat Party. It is a cover up mechanism for the powerful scum in high places. And it is a weapon to be used to destroy any outsider who dares to change this corrupt system for the better. /End I dedicate this rare thread to the many on here whose threads are always must reads.

The one detailing a timeline of events leading up to Flynn's resignation? It's in Mueller's hands.Bloop! https://t.co/44TTOLhBoV 2. The reporter for this story has been allowed to READ the memo in its entirety as well as other underlying WH records quoted in the memo, such as other notes and memos written by McGahn and other senior administration officials. 3. The reporter also interviewed a dozen former and current WH officials, attorneys who have interacted with Mueller's team and witnesses questioned by Mueller. 4. Doowd and SEkulow quoted selectively from this memo to argue that Trump did not obstruct justice. THey also said (LOL) that even if Trump knew there had been FBI probe of Flynn, he believed Flynn had been cleared. Double LOL. Sure, that's why he asked Comey to let it go. 5. Full review of the memo on part of the reporter \"flatly contradicts\" Dowd and Sekulow's story. Memo states Trump WAS told Flynn was under FBI investigation: this statement is based in part on contemporaneous notes written by? Reince Priebus, ding ding, ding! 6. Priebus wrote notes after discussing the Flynn FBi probe matter with Trump. If that wasn't enough?McGahn's recollections to HIS STAFF (=more contemporaneous witnesses) about what he personally told Trump Re: Flynn are also included in materials used to write the memo. 7. The above statement is corroborated by other records that the reporter was able to review. ALSO: people familiar with the matter told the reporter that BOTH Priebus &amp; McGahn have confirmed in separate interviews with Mueller that they DID tell Trump about FBI probe into Flynn. 8. See why that McGahn interview smack in the middle of the Flynn flipping news went on in two separate sessions? BC EVIDENCE. ANd Mueller was probably all \"see your colleague Reince testified the opposite of what you tried to claim here. \" 9. Naturally, Trump was told that Flynn was under FBI investigation by BOTH Priebus and McGahn BEFORE he met with Comey and asked him to \"let it go\". So this is pure unadulterated obstruction of justice, confirmed by MULTIPLE contemporaneous witnesses. LOL 10. Yates on Jan. 24, 2017 met with McGahn to warn him that US intelligence agencies had intercepted calls between Flynn and Kislyak and that they had discussed sanctions. 11. Yates underlined how Flynn concealed the truth from Pence, making Flynn vulnerable to Ryssian blackmail as the Russians knew the truth. LATER THAT SAME DAY McGahn BRIEFED TRUMP about what Yates had told him, per confidential WH records and interviews. 12. PRIEBUS was also present at the meeting (hence why, as we always explained, them having same lawyer means SAME version of facts). the McGahn timeline demonstrates that Trump was CLEARLY informed during that meeting that Flynn was under criminal FBI investigation. Oops. 13. \"Trump directed McGahn to find out more, including any information about the criminal investigation of Flynn, before deciding on a course of action-\" Narrator: Trump decided the course of action was to pressure Comey to \"let it go\". Yeah, intent to obstruct. 14. \"A person with first-hand knowledge told me that during interviews with the special counsel, both McGahn and Priebus confirmed that they had informed Trump during this meeting that Flynn was being investigated by the FBI.\" TWO direct witnesses. 15. Please note: McGahn LIED in his account to defend Trump, meaning quite certainly he was then FORCED too cooperate with Mueller in order to avoid repercussions. 16. \"Further, according to three current and former administration officials, McGahn also relayed to President Trump that Flynn had told the FBI the same false story he’d earlier told Pence (that Flynn had never spoken to Kislyak about sanctions)\" Oh. OH. 17. This means Trump KNEW Flynn had lied to the FBI, which is a felony. And yeah, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI when he flipped. YET he kept on lying about Flynn AND not only didn't immediately fire him, but also asked Comey to stop the investigation. 18. Reporter: \"Additionally, my sources say that the special counsel also interviewed the two White House attorneys, John Eisenberg and James Burnham, who helped draft the McGahn memo, in which they, too, concluded that Trump was told that Flynn was under FBI investigation. \" 19. So literally EVERY legal representative in the WH PLUS Priebus and aides KNOWS Trump willfully obstructed justice AND told Mueller sp. IN case we're not clear. Jolly good. 20. BOTH WH attorneys \"said that they questioned McGahn while researching the timeline; one of them independently recalled McGahn’s contemporaneously telling the president that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI\". 21. McGahn then on Jan 27 tried to play the \"but if we take action vs Flynn we might interfere with FBI prob\" with Yates. Yates was all \"um no honey, we're not informing you and then expecting you to sit on your hands\". 22. The reason why Trump's knowledge of the criminal investigation into Flynn is central to Mueller's obstruction case is bc it clearly reveals and shows Trump's INTENT to obstruct when he told Comey on the night of Jan. 27 to \"let it go\". 23. Jan. 27 is when Trump called Comey to invited him to dinner that evening at the WH. Per Comey's testimony, he did NOT understand they would b ALONE until he arrived at the WH. Which obviously constituted a MAJOR problem as it was fully inappropriate. 24. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that Trump suggested to him at the dinner that his job might not be secure, leading Comey to believe that Trump was attempting to \"create some sort of patronage relationship\". (which was obviously nowhere near OK). 25. Per Comey \"A few moments later the president said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. \" As we now all know. 26. On Feb. 8 the WaPo broke story that Flynn had indeed spoken to Kislyak about sanctions and that OOPS, there were receipts. In attempting to formulate a response, Priebus, McGahn, and Eisenberg questioned Flynn. Flynn's story broke down but he was all \"I don't remember\". 27. Priebus then specifically asked Flynn whether he was interviewed by FBI (per memos). “Flynn stated that FBI agents met with him to inform him that their investigation was over.” LOL SERIOUSLY? LIE! So at THAT point, Pence, Priebus and McGahn recommended Flynn be fired. 28. The rest is history we know as Flynn resigned on Feb. 13 to avoid being fired. The day AFTER, after ALL that had happened and Trump being FULLY aware of Flynn's total guilt AND of the FBI investigation into Flynn, Trump pressured Comey to shut down the FBI Flynn probe. 29. Per known reports, Trump told Comey: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy.” Trump then repeated: “I hope that you can let this go.” Pure obstruction. 30. Let's be clear: by that point not only Trump knew full well that Flynn was extra dirty and had lied to the FBI... Flynn was gone so this wasn't about Flynn AT ALL. This was about Trump being scared of what the FBI would find out ABOUT HIM ordering Flynn to act like a traitor. 31. Seukolow and Dowd willfully and blatantly lied to Mueller by exploiting the lie that caused Flynn's firing, which was Flynn telling Priebus McGahn et al that the FBI only spoke with him to tell him the investigation into him had been closed. Incredibly stupid AND sloppy. 32. Sekulow and Dowd tried to pretend that Flynn's false assertions were reported to Trump but there is ZERO information OR evidence in that sense. (of course). And even if? They KNEW Flynn had lied and knew straight from Yates, so LOL. 33. Buried Lede: \"Aside from McGahn, Eisenberg, and Burnham, the special counsel has interviewed FIVE OTHER attorneys who currently work for the White House counselor or have previously done so, according to administration records\" .

Instead, use de novo clustering algorithms to form OTUs 1/ Open/closed reference methods were developed because people have the type of crappy data that you get when reads don't fully overlap. High error rates increase the number of uniques making downstream processing more difficult 2/ https://t.co/TwQmAnJ4M8 So why are open (and closed) reference clustering bad? Let's look at closed reference first. I may self-plagiarize in some of the following tweets 3/ https://t.co/SV7G8C5M7v Obviously, you're limited to seeing what is in the database. Considering we're sequencing deeper than any of the studies that generated the reference sequences, we're going to fail to classify many sequences 4/ Using a mouse dataset we found 32,106 unique sequences. Using a 3% threshold we were able to map 27,876 w/ VSEARCH and 27,737 w/ USEARCH - both methods are heuristics, which help to speed things up, but cut corners 5/ When we calculated the actual distances between the mouse sequences and the database sequences, we were able to map 28,238 sequences to a reference 6/ We then randomized the order of the database. We got different numbers of sequences to map to a reference with different randomizations. The default order is probably about as bad as you could do 7/ https://t.co/v5Txhea2US The XSEARCH heuristics cut corners and don't have perfect sensitivity. But they also result in a loss of specificity - USEARCH was 0.73 and VSEARCH was 0.60 8/ But that's just the start. The reference that many use is based on the greengenes database (fwiw - greengenes is defunct and the database has not been updated) 9/ The reference represents sequences that are not more than 97% similar to each other... over the full length of the gene. We popped out the V4 region of those sequences 10/ Among these V4 fragments, we found that 3,132 ref sequences had one duplicate, of those, 443 had discordant taxonomies. Among the 1,699 V4 reference sequences with two or more duplicates, 698 had discordant taxonomies 11/ We found reference sequences that had 10, 30 and even 131 reference sequences that contained 7, 7, and 5 different taxonomies 12/ We calculated the true distance between the mice &amp; ref seqs: 47% of the mouse seqs mapped to refs that were identical over the V4 region, 17% mapped equally well to 2+ refs that were not identical over the V4 region 13/ 13% had a conflicted taxonomy *gulp* 14/ Yes closed-reference OTUs are \"stable\", but only if you look at it from the samples' perspective. They aren't from the references' perspective. This has consequences for people using Fast UniFrac, PICRUSt, etc 15/ Some of these problems could be solved w/ a ref where the V4 (or whatever region) sequences are not more than 97% similar to each other, but you'd also have to deal with conflicting taxonomies and the poor specificity of XSEARCH 16/ Let's discuss one more thing before moving on to open reference clustering. With closed reference, if a seq is more than 97% similar (or whatever level) to a reference, the seq is assigned to that ref OTU 17/ We've already discussed several problems with this. Another, is that two seqs might only be 94% similar to each other, but be in the same OTU - this isn't what we typically think is going on when we talk about 97% OTUs. Right? 18/ Now open reference clustering... In this approach, sequences are first subjected to closed ref clustering and those that don't map to a reference are run through a de novo clustering approach 19/ In de novo clustering sequences that are more than 97% similar to each other are clustered. There are many ways to do this and I certainly have data/papers to support one over the field of methods 20/ When one uses open ref clustering, you get all the problems of closed reference clustering, but you are also mixing and matching OTU definitions 21/ You get the possibility of sequences that are only 94% similar to each other in the same OTU (closed ref) and those that are at least 97% similar to each other (de novo) 22/ Depending on what type of samples you're sequencing you'll get different ratios of OTUs generated by closed ref and de novo clustering. Human/mouse are mostly closed, soil probably has more de novo 23/ We developed using an objective, distance-based metric for assessing OTU clustering quality. It asks are the correct sequences included in the OTU and are there any sequences that should have been included in the OTU? It's called MCC 24/ Here's what we saw for a few datasets. This shows that the closed/open reference algorithms don't measure up to de novo https://t.co/Gsg6C9hCfV 25/ https://t.co/1eyyurrXlg Later we developed our own de novo heuristic that optimizes MCC as it forms the OTUs - OptiClust. This forms the best OTUs of any clustering method we've found https://t.co/1fEDtlt3x2 26/ https://t.co/ZQb9fZvSKi One nock against de novo methods is that you get different results for each iteration of the method. Yup. What we've found is that you get equally good clusterings - there is no one optimal method 27/ There's also the nock that we shouldn't be using OTUs, but that's a topic for another tweet storm 28/ Appendix: Here's actual data showing what happens when reads don't overlap. As shown in the above blog post, we (and many others) have tried extending the contig lengths with the 2x300 V3 chemistry and it just sucks 29/ https://t.co/VmwbOsJSij Appendix: Regardless of that plea and a lot of experience, people have pushed using reads that don't fully overlap (or that don't overlap at all). Examples include EMP and AGP data where single reads or 2x150 nt reads were used to sequence the 250 nt V4 region 30/ Appendix: Other examples include people getting greedy and sequencing V3-V4 with 2x250 nt reads or 2x300 nt reads 31/ Footnote: I've been saying the same thing for years now. My critique of open/closed ref clustering was published 4+ years ago and I'm not sure anyone gives a rip. Why not? What am I missing? That we had to write this https://t.co/9yaqOCtn8H underscores my point 32/ Fin: Get good data and use the best methods 33/","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"185631499"},"id_str":"185631499","name":"Pat Schloss","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"6677"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"651"},"created_at":"Wed Sep 01 13:19:43 +0000 2010","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"28762"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"33"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"105"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"282"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"9"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.00273"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"3"}}

In light of the ongoing clusterfuck that is #brexit, let me tell you a little about my white, Australian experience of dealing with the UK visa authority, a complete shitshow of a bureaucracy that is in no way prepared to handle what's coming. My husband and I first moved to the UK in January 2011. He'd been given a position at a good university there - however, because the Tories had slashed the number of visas any uni was allowed to sponsor, they were unable to sponsor him even though they'd hired him. Fortunately for us, my maternal grandfather was born in the UK, which meant I was eligible for an ancestry visa. A much more expensive visa than a sponsored one would've been, but it came with greater protections and my husband could work as my spouse. So we opted to do that. Of course, in visa-language, \"spouse\" is code for \"woman who does not work,\" so there was no designated space on my husband's spousal visa application to include his offer of work. We had to put all that info in as an extra detail and hope they noticed. The whole process was expensive, labrynthine &amp; nervewracking, but in the end, we got to the UK. Fast forward three years, and our son is born in England in 2014. Because the UK has no jus soli, he has no British citizenship; we have to apply to have him recognised as Australian. This also means that we need to get him a passport so that he can one day leave the country. Which means travelling, in person, to a far-distant visa authority office, which is basically a warehouse, with an infant in tow. We were there for about SEVEN HOURS. Fun fact about visa authority offices: even though it's legally required for children and babies to attend under various circumstances, they contain absolutely zero provisions for people attending with small children. Seven hours in a warehouse with no baby change tables. We were only able to get hot water to mix with my son's formula by asking to use the employee kitchen, and even then, the guards wouldn't let us in there; they brought us the water, with several frowning and lowkey chiding us as though we had any say in being there with him. I'll note, too, that consulates are similarly restrictive about the needs of babies, but at least they have the excuse of actual security risks to consider and try to run smoothly and on time to compensate for it. The UK visa authority warehouses? Not so much. Fastforward again to 2015: we're living in Scotland and considering applying for permanent residency, which means taking the UK citizenship test. The visa processing centre in Aberdeen had been closed, so we had to drive five hours to the one in Dundee after prepaying etc online. We get to the Dundee centre. It's basically a fancy shed: the entire thing is basically one open room on several levels with office dividers put up. It's freezing cold outside. We, like many other applicants, have our toddler with us of necessity. But \"no babies allowed\" inside. This is justified because, as stated, the whole place is just a shed - there's no walls between the testing &amp; waiting areas, and they don't want child-noise to distract the test-takers. So anyone with a small child has to wait with them outside. IN SCOTLAND. IN WINTER. If an adult showed up alone with a baby? They would've been turned away. Parents who came in pairs had to take turns with their kid outside, where there was no shelter and no place to sit. In 4C weather, I saw a frozen woman cradling a baby in arms as she paced in the wind. My husband and I were \"lucky\" - we'd driven there, so we had the car to sit in. My husband went first while I waited in the car with our son. Fifteen minutes passed. My husband came back, visibly shaking. He hadn't been allowed to even sit the test. Why? Because on the dropdown form he'd filled out online, he'd accidentally clicked that he was bringing a different type of valid ID to the one he'd actually brought. So even though he had valid ID on him, even though it was the matter of a single mis-checked box, they refused him. Next, it was my turn. Now, at that time, my passport was still in my maiden name, because I'd got it just in advance of our wedding to go on our overseas honeymoon. This had posed no issue when getting my visa to the UK, or in opening a bank account there in my married name. As I'd done in every other instance, I'd brought my original marriage certificate with me, because all my utilities, bank statements etc referred to me by my married name. Again: this documentation had been sufficient to get me INTO THE ACTUAL COUNTRY and to work and bank there. But to sit the fucking citizenship test in a shed in Dundee? Oh, no. For that, I was told, only BRITISH marriage certificates could be accepted. Never mind that I was from a Commonwealth country: I was likewise deemed to have insufficient ID and turned away. I asked if I could speak to a supervisor; no, there wasn't anyone higher around than the woman I was dealing with. Could I call the relevant office for help? No; it was Saturday, nobody would answer. The office was closed. So we had to turn around and drive right back home. On the basis of this, we decided we didn't want to stay in the UK anymore, but we still needed to renew our expiring visas. Which, as they were ancestry visas, meant: a) paying around £2000 for the three of us; and b) sending in huge quantities of original ID documents. These documents included: all our passports, original marriage certificate, all our original birth certificates, my MOTHER'S original birth certificate, my GRANDFATHER'S original long-form birth certificate, bank &amp; utility statements, original work contracts - EVERYTHING. By the time we came to send this all off in late November 2015, my husband had a job offer back in Australia, so we planned to leave the UK in April - we only need the visas extended for the next five months. So we send our stuff off, and we wait. And wait. And wait. We can see from our bank statements that the UK visa authority has taken the £2000-odd pounds processing fee from us, but we're into 2016 and haven't heard anything - until, in late January, we get a letter telling us that our application and all our documents have been lost. Specifically: having received our application at their first processing centre, the visa authority took our money, made NO OTHER RECORD OF OUR APPLICATION, and then send our docs on to their other centre, via the REGULAR-ASS UNPROTECTED MAIL SERVICE, whose post depot flooded. Ours was not the only application thus affected. In fact, we were later told by the Australian consulate, fuckups of this nature are *common* to the UK visa authority, who are apparently known for being careless with documents, slow, &amp; generally incompetent by other governments. So: we need new passports in order to leave the country. But to get new passports, we need new supporting documentation. And all those documents WERE ALSO LOST. And me? My passport is my only photo ID. So we had to get my mother IN AUSTRALIA to get a new birth cert for me. We then had to organise, and pay out of pocket for, a two-day trip to London (where the consulate is) FROM ABERDEEN, to get new passports in an expedited, not-reliant-on-the-Royal-Mail fashion. Which, again, cost us about £2000 out of pocket. It KILLED our savings. In the end, the UK visa authority refunded us for the application they couldn't process, and returned our \"lost\" documents (which evidently weren't destroyed by water after all) to us. But by then, it was late in 2016, almost a full year after we'd applied, and we were in Aus. We never recovered or were compensated for the additional £2000 we lost having to sort things out, and because of THEIR ERROR, the UK visa authority now flags all our passports whenever we enter the UK, because for some reason, they need a re-explanation of what happened. The entire 5 years we lived in the UK - as well-off, white, English-speaking, Commonwealth citizens - the UK visa authority was a hostile, incomprehensible, unpleasant, stressful entity to deal with. That's it's baseline mode: it is profoundly more vile to anyone less privileged. It's a cold, hard fact that dealing with the UK visa authority trashed both my husband's and my mental health and left us in a financial hole which, without the support of solvent, caring family members, we would never have climbed out of. Years later, we're only just recovering. How an entity so comprehensively dedicated to intransigence and bureaucratic pettifogging can possibly hope to deal with the hugely expanded workload necessitated by a hard #Brexit is beyond me. They simply won't cope, and any UK citizens wanting visas should beware. In all respects, the UK visa authority almost perfectly fits the description that Douglas Adams famously gave to his Vogons: \"Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous\" - the \"almost\" is because these days, yeah: they actually ARE evil, too. In conclusion: the marriage of xenophobia and bureaucratic incompetence is one of the ugliest in the modern world, and that's saying something. The UK isn't alone in perpetuating this particular evil, so let it be a lesson to everyone on a similar path to FIX THAT SHIT NOW.

Crossing into Canada a few days ago, I warned my 9-yr-old, Saira (not her real name), not to giggle. Crossing was a breeze. Coming back, I said, would take longer... Entering U.S. involved a lot more questions. The guard questioned Saira. Who is, as I said, nine. But she smiled a lot and all was ok; then he told us to turn off the car, &amp; Saira gasped. Border patrol were surrounding car next to us, hands on their guns, shouting... Our guard had his hand on his gun, too, &amp; his eyes on the car. \"Out of the car!\" a guard barked. I was confused. It'd pulled up after us. There'd been no search, no time for search. They couldn't have found drugs. A woman emerged... \"About 28,\" Saira later estimated. Wore a nice white tank top, glasses. Latinx. Hands in the air. Face stunned and scared. They made her walk backwards, grabbed her arms. \"Are they going to--\" Saira asked. They did. They cuffed her. They repeated the drill with the man in the passenger seat. He kept glancing over his shoulder as he walked back w/ hands in air, &amp; they kept yelling at him, but he didn't want to fall. Not a time for any mistakes. That's when I made mine... I took pictures. There's a sign on the border booth forbidding cameras, &amp; I didn't notice, so that part's on me. The prohibition of documentation of armed agents of the state? That's on the U.S. government. The guard, tho, blamed me... He grabbed my phone. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. I was w/ my daughter; not a time to invoke journalism. He held up his hand &amp; then began scrolling. Well past the two pics I'd just taken. Which constitutes an illegal search, no? I was more worried about my daughter... \"Daddy,\" she asked, \"are you going to get arrested, too?\" I sighed. \"No,\" I said, \"I don't think so, but I might lose my phone.\" This distressed her, too -- it was filled w/ our vacation pictures. \"Pull over,\" the guard said. \"Go through the green door.\" Inside was a room crowded, mostly with families. Not detained; paused. Some longer than others. There was no line. \"You wait for them to call your name,\" another dad explained. I noticed something; Saira noticed, too. They kept calling the white people... Why were white people called before the many non-white families who'd been waiting longer? You can guess easily as my 9-yr-old did, but the journalist in me can't say for sure. That's part of power: evidence of discrimination without certainty. Everyone guessing. I'm not suggesting that the U.S. border guards had a deliberate plan to favor white people over non-whites. They just appeared to do so. They weren't all white themselves. That's how power works, too: the uniform is that of white supremacy. I was worried about my daughter, of course. And that concern shaped something ugly in me: A hope that our whiteness would keep us out of further trouble. One more aspect of power's control: it plucks the strings of the ugliest chords within you... Sure enough, after awhile a guard called us -- ahead of the black family &amp; the Asian family in between which we'd been sitting, both waiting longer than us. I went to the counter, glad &amp; guilty &amp; furious. A guard held our passports &amp; my phone... I said what I believed needed to be said, especially with my 9-yr-old holding my hand: \"I'm sorry. I was stupid.\" The guard nodded, &amp; handed over our passports &amp; my phone. \"We deleted the pictures you took,\" he said... Now, I can imagine some folks saying, \"I can't believe you apologized to those fascists!\" To which I'll say: That's how power works. It makes you complicit. It makes you craven. I've experienced it before... I've reported in countries where men with guns forbid pictures, &amp; I've had men point their guns at me &amp; order me to delete my pictures. But before I was a journalist, when I was 20, I crossed the Sahara with my older sister. We ran into trouble in Algeria... This was in 1992. A civil war broke out while we were there. An Islamic party had won a fair election, &amp; the gov't had responded w/ tanks. Some 100,000 would die, but we didn't see any fighting: just a vast crowd, trying to flee, like us, at a remote desert crossing... We were visibly American. A soldier separated us from the crowd. His rifle strap was too big for his frame, &amp; as he walked the gun slapped his ass. Bap, bap, bap. I was 20, dumb, &amp; I laughed. Bad move. My sister began apologizing. Then she said something in Arabic; he laughed... I asked her what she'd said. \"I said, 'My brother's an idiot,'\" she told me. Soon, more soldiers surrounded us: delighted by the young American woman fluent in Arabic. (She's an Arabic lit scholar.) They let me stand, but they made her tea... They offered her sugar &amp; asked if she was married &amp; what kind of man she wanted to marry &amp; if she might marry an Algerian man. She smiled. After three hours, they let us cross. Everyone else remained, inside the country collapsing into war. That's how power works... The power of gender, of the men w/ guns who demanded flirtation as the price of crossing the border, &amp; of empire, the American one, that brought us to the front of the line, &amp; of borders, that put little tyrants in charge of lines in the sand... So even with the guns &amp; the yelling &amp; the confiscated phone, crossing back into the U.S. was a lot easier than out of Algeria, &amp; for that I was glad, &amp; ashamed. \"What happened to the couple?\" my 9-yr-old asked. I had to her I didn't know, that I was afraid we couldn't know... I'm not reporting here, I'm just talking about crossing the border yesterday, on vacation w/ my daughter. Maybe that couple was wanted for real crimes, for all I know. But their car wasn't searched. \"Was it like the kids?\" my daughter asked. She meant on the Mexican border... \"It might have been,\" I said. She asked if we'd done something wrong taking pictures. \"No,\" I said. She pointed out I'd said it was stupid. \"Stupid because I got caught,\" I said. \"Stupid because I was with you. I'm sorry.\" \"It's not your fault,\" she said. Which was true... The night before we'd watched The Hunger Games. (I know, a little much for a 9-yr-old. But she'd read the books, so...) We both thought of the evil \"Peackeepers\" &amp; their white uniforms, &amp; the shouting border guards in their black uniforms... When we got to St. Albans, VT, we pulled over and went for a walk. I asked my daughter if she'd been afraid. She surprised me. \"No,\" she said. She thought for a moment. \"Mostly, I was burning with anger.\" My daughter knew we were lucky. She knew if she weren't 9, I might have had a harder time, that if we weren't white we might still be there. But the anger was personal, too. It was all mixed up. That's how power works. Later we came to a covered bridge on which someone had chalked \"Love=Rage.\" That fit her mood, &amp; the chalk was still there, so she added her own message: \"Keep our country colorful.\" That helped, but she was still mad. Because here's the thing: We got off \"easy,\" right? White privilege, right? *Yes.* &amp; still it sucked, because of what happened &amp; because of the slime of fear &amp; complicity it left on us. I hear white liberals talk sometimes as if they've nothing to fear... ...as if the power of authoritarianism threatens only people of color. It threatens POC more; but it threatens *everybody.* That's what authoritarianism is. You do nobody any favors by imagining you're immune. As my daughter saw at the border, authoritarianism targets POC first &amp; most severely; the secondary goal of white supremacy, tho, is to keep white subjects in line through a mix of privilege &amp; subtle punishment for questioning that privilege. Authoritarianism cultivates paranoia &amp; self-censorship. It depends on us to internalize the ways in which it pushes around; it wants us to feel guilty for being afraid. It wants us to speak in the passive voice. Anyway, before we got back on the road, I looked at my phone. Yes, they'd deleted the pictures I'd taken of border guards surrounding a Latinx couple; and, it seemed, they'd also deleted two previous, a pic of a mural &amp; a pic of my daughter smiling over a stawberry smoothie... So here's a new picture. I don't put my kids' pictures on the public internet, but with my daughter's approval -- this is part of her \"burning anger\" -- here she is, adding her slogan, #keepourcountrycolorful, to one of which she approves, not far south of the border. https://t.co/aQLniu1USF","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"15268600"},"id_str":"15268600","name":"Jeff Sharlet","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"25008"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3484"},"created_at":"Sun Jun 29 05:26:12 +0000 2008","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"40128"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"34"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"22913"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"114492"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"1"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"674"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3367"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.96827"},"all_hashtags":["keepourcountrycolorful"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Anger","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Anger","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818419c"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"382"},"texto":"1) I’m amused to see @JonahNRO scrambling for higher ground amid the insane tide of nutjob conspiracism that has overtaken the Right in the age of Trump. Amused, because Goldberg had no small role in conjuring up that tide, and still does. Thread follows. https://t.co/P3c4Xr6jkI 2) In addition to his role as editor of National Review’s online presence, Goldberg also has been living, ideologically speaking, from his book written a decade ago, ‘Liberal Fascism.’ I had a brief to-and-fro with him regarding its veracity at the time: https://t.co/Mnaq704Hqm 3) I also organized a group of historians who actually specialize in fascism and put their essays together in a project at History News Network, to which Goldberg also responded (see links to all pieces at bottom of this intro): https://t.co/BlYXY1VfRW 4) One of Goldberg’s favorites tactics in responding to critics was to affect a high-minded superiority to his interlocutors, who were simply too stupid to comprehend the profound intellectual heights to which he clearly believed he had climbed. https://t.co/YTEhNOV06l 5) His critics made clear that his thesis – that “fascism is a phenomenon of the left, not the right” – is rubbish, reflecting eagerness to embrace fascists’ own propaganda while ignoring the recorded history of their actions, distinct from their words. https://t.co/AUJ8qgFF4e 5) One of the points he loved to repeat when promoting the book was that, well, he wasn’t saying all liberals were fascists and all fascists liberals, but rather he was just making a point so convoluted it became a nonsequitur. It’s right in the text: https://t.co/utmbBEiSor 6) Yet even as he made these and similar claims, he was appearing on right-wing shows promoted by pundits who in fact were quite eager to claim that all liberals or progressives were fascists. Foremost among these was Glenn Beck. https://t.co/I9iSr7liyg 7) Goldberg appeared on Beck’s show multiple times to promote ‘Liberal Fascism.’ With Goldberg there in the studio, Beck proceeded to claim that the progressive movement was fascist in its origins and in its behavior today. Bailouts were fascist. Health-care reform was fascist. At no point did Jonah demur. Indeed, he joined right in. https://t.co/kPrPI8vlrr 8) Eventually Beck produced a ‘documentary’ based on Goldberg’s book he titled ‘Live Free or Die’ that called the progressive movement a ‘cancer’ and blamed progressives for every genocide of the 20th century. https://t.co/xeHqk99S8E https://t.co/LtHOPyjL9x 9) At one point, Goldberg and Beck got together and counted all the ways that progressives and fascists were the exact same thing: https://t.co/F58HArJPoQ 10) Flash forward nine years, and guess what? @DineshDSouza has cobbled together another right-wing bestseller that essentially replicates and updates Goldberg’s thesis. It’s titled ‘The Big Lie,’ and it features antifascists on the cover because they’re the _real_ fascists. https://t.co/4eSS0a3cQe 11) D’Souza doesn’t even attempt to demur with high-mindedness as Goldberg does. He nakedly calls Democrats ‘the real fascists’ and equates today’s liberals with 1920s Klansmen, which even Goldberg knew better than to attempt. (He just dismissed the KKK as a crazy movie fan club. 12) It came out two weeks before Charlottesville. And of course, everyone on TV that weekend saw the real dynamic we face: White nationalists bearing swastikas and Dixie flags, chanting Nazi slogans and Trump’s name and wearing MAGA hats, all battling black-clad antifascists. 13) This year, rather hilariously, D’Souza is hoping he can convince everyone that’s not what they really saw. With a new movie (‘Death of a Nation’) out in theaters spouting his thesis that Democrats are the real Nazis, D’Souza is gaslighting us. 14) He’s actually attempting to persuade everyone that what they’re seeing in Charlottesville this weekend is just two warring leftist factions. Seriously. https://t.co/x827A31OTI 15) Which is kind of undermined by all the Confederate flags and MAGA hats the organizers’ side like to carry. This year in DC it was American flags. Oh, and the fact that they named it “Unite the Right.” https://t.co/E0qlbKyPJz 16) I’ve covered a number of the right-wing Patriot Prayer events here on the West Coast, which lately have been featuring the violently pro-Trump hate group Proud Boys as their main muscle. They carry Trump banners. They make right-wing pronouncements. They are NOT leftists. https://t.co/XeFE5YWPLc 17) All this comes back to the point I raised with Jonah lo these many years ago, to wit: If we’re going to discuss fascism in America, oughtn’t we consider and examine the organizations that are expressly fascist and have mostly existed on the fringe of our politics since WWII? 18) There were openly fascist groups that operated in the 1920s and ‘30s, such as William Dudley Pelley’s Silver Shirts. Their direct descendants included William Potter Gale and Mike Beach, founders of the Posse Comitatus, and early neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell. https://t.co/6jKyDxTA0K 19) This fringe remained very much alive through the 1970s and 1980s thanks to movements like the Klan revival led by David Duke and the violent neo-Nazi skinheads. https://t.co/EWLlXEwzvH 20] They reshaped themselves a couple of ways in the 1990s as Patriot militiamen (essentially a version of white supremacist ideology rebranding and remaking its image for mainstream consumption) and pseudo-academic white nationalists of the Jared Taylor/American Renaissance ilk. 21) Today’s alt-right and militia “III Percent” movements, as well as the Alex Jones conspiracism that fuels all of these elements and provides them with their shared epistemological bubble, are direct products of these movements. 22) All of them are, and always have been, definably right-wing movements. There is nothing remotely left-wing about them, and never has been. D’Souza’s risible claims to the contrary notwithstanding. 23) These are the shoals of hard factual and historical reality upon which these revisionist attempts to reimagine fascism as somehow a left-wing phenomenon run aground. They look frankly ridiculous when confronted with the presence of actual American fascists today. 24) Example: Patriot Front, the neo-Nazis who’ve been spreading fliers in your neighborhoods. They are explicit fascists who even use a fasces as their symbol. One of the fliers reads: ‘Making America Safe For Fascism Again.’ https://t.co/iVpLzzEMjW (More here.) https://t.co/Jj7jLeyScf 26) When not promoting the idea of fascism, the rest of the Patriot Front agenda is straight out of D’Souza’s own list of top favorite subjects: Stopping immigration, defending “western civilization,” attacking LGBT rights, attacking nonwhite civil rights and hate-crime laws. 27) So when he tries to claim that these are somehow “radical leftists,” he just looks stupid and foolish. But you know, that’s his call. 28) 25) This is, in fact, the point I made to Goldberg in my original review of ‘Liberal Fascism’ for The American Prospect: https://t.co/iCmXlkNEXh https://t.co/JevZpmBCda 29) Goldberg was never able to provide a good reply. Rather, he just dismissed it with the immortal line: “Who gives a rat’s ass about the Posse Comitatus?” https://t.co/ZfXIjW1ZEd 30) Now Goldberg wants us to believe that, while the rest of movement conservatism appears to have been inundated by the tide of Trumpist insanity, there are still a few good old reliable _real_ conservatives rising above it all. 31) Yet at the same time, he himself is responsible for having unleashed much of this same insanity. Indeed, he not only gave rise to D’Souza’s crackpottery, he continues to endorse it himself, quite avidly: https://t.co/fuL04i6kDE 32) He’s been called out for it by other conservatives, too: https://t.co/5oULoDGf2H 33) So just remember, when you hear Jonah moan about the difficulty of being a “good” conservative these days, that this is the same man who actively made the ugly little bed in which he now has to sleep – and he still give it a nice plumping daily.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"2602262088"},"id_str":"2602262088","name":"David Neiwert","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"29160"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"2153"},"created_at":"Thu Jul 03 21:31:24 +0000 2014","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"8065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"36"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1663"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"6831"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"46"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"190"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.03036"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

A: how long you got? a thread.. #Exvangelical #ChurchToo 1/? https://t.co/KSw3dKhP47 purity culture is the pervasive set of beliefs, structures, &amp; actions that place a heavy focus on the virginity &amp; \"physical/spiritual/emotional purity\" of women/girls 2/ it is heavily influenced by patriarchal beliefs such as male headship, women being unable to serve in the same capacity as men in the church (&amp; sometimes world at large), complementarian gender roles (women are made to run the home, men to provide by working), etc 3/ it is also heavily influenced by a cisheteronormative/anti-LGBTQ belief system wherein virginity is defined by the lack of PIV sex (the only kind of \"real sex\"), oral/anal/etc are often considered sinful even WITHIN a hetero marriage, &amp; gender binaries determine sex drive 4/ church/youth group/Christian school lessons on sex: - men/boys have out of control sex drives &amp; lust that they can't control - women/girls want love &amp; give sex to get it - virginity is a gift for your future husband &amp; losing it cannot be undone 5/ - losing your virginity is the equivalent to being chewed gum, backwash in a cup, a rose with no petals, tape that has lost it's stickiness, etc. these illustrations are uniquely applied to women/girls bc it is their responsibility to save this gift for future husband 6/ - modesty is imperative bc boys/men cannot control their eyes or lust, so it is the job of girls/women to keep them from stumbling. our bodies are dangerous &amp; capable of causing men to sin, thus WE are sinning if we don't cover up for the sake of men 7/ - even THOUGHTS are sinful, so you must work overtime to prevent even the slightest hint of sexual thought from entering your brain - sex outside het marriage is dirty, an abomination - masturbating is a form of cheating on future spouse &amp; also lust, so dirty/sinful also 8/ there is a heavy emphasis on how terrible you will feel if you violate any of the purity standards that have been set for you, &amp; so normal &amp; age-appropriate sexual exploration becomes a vicious cycle of shame &amp; guilt (sometimes for something as benign as holding hands!) 9/ purity culture also intentionally withholds sex education, because children who aren't taught about sex will obviously not think about sex, right? this leads to people like me who cannot identify basic body parts well into my college years 10/ when you spend the first 20-some years of your life trying desperately to repress any sex drive or attraction you might feel bc allowing yourself to feel it would be sinful, &amp; spinning in shame &amp; guilt for failing, it is TRAUMATIC. purity culture is a complex trauma 11/ it is a trauma of incidents compiled over a lifetime, no one particular thing ever seeming bad enough to rise to the level of traumatic, but put together it causes many of the same symptoms as sexual assault/abuse/trauma bc it is a form of sexual trauma 12/ I got married &amp; discovered sexuality is not a switch I can flip on as I was taught. Even the thought of having sex WITH MY HUSBAND caused anxiety &amp; panic attacks, &amp; actually attempting sex sent me spiraling in shame &amp; guilt despite knowing \"it's okay now bc I'm married\" 13/ I also have vaginismus as a result of my trauma. This is a pelvic floor condition in which my vaginal muscles involuntarily contract &amp; do not allow anything to enter as well as causing severe pain upon trying. this is also common in sexual abuse/assault survivors 14/ I cried myself to sleep for months. not only could I not figure out how to want or enjoy the sex I waited so long to have, but my body was physically betraying me. I was a failure &amp; couldn't give my husband what he needed. I was taught this was my wifely duty &amp; I was failing 15/ the sense of failure only worsened my shame spiral &amp; we eventually gave up trying. I then felt guilty for being relieved that I didn't have to think about sex any more, bc thinking about it still made me feel dirty as I had been told to feel my whole life to this point 16/ I eventually started therapy &amp; have started the long process of sorting through my trauma surrounding sex, but it's an ongoing process. I'm now also in PT to deal with the physical aspect of vaginismus, but it's a slow, painful process w/ no guarantee of full recovery 17/ on top of this, I'm bisexual. I repressed this aspect of myself even deeper than my sexual thoughts about men. I grew up being taught that I would go to hell, that LGBTQ+ folks are abominations, sexual perverts, disgusting. 18/ despite changing theology &amp; being LGBTQ+ affirming by this point, I still couldn't admit to myself or anyone that I was bi. it took months of intense inner work in therapy to even come out to myself. imagine growing up &amp; being instilled with such disgust for WHO YOU ARE 19/ I was never given space or tools to develop a healthy sexuality. I'm basically in 2nd puberty, trying to relearn &amp; reconstruct my sexuality from the ground up after doing so much work to dismantle the lies I was given as a framework 20/ I still have trouble touching my own or my husband's genitals, bc they were portrayed as dirty, gross, &amp; sinful. I struggled for months with the idea that I couldn't have real sex without being able to have PIV, but sex is so much more than that 21/ my sex drive, when it does make an appearance, is still often guilt &amp; shame ridden. it is so deeply ingrained in my body that sexual thoughts are evil, even when they are about my husband, that shame &amp; guilt often override any sexual desire I might have 22/ if I'm not careful, I still fall into shame cycles about the fact that I'm \"still a technical virgin\" because a penis has never graced my vagina with it's presence🙄 when you're told for so long that's what defines sex, it's hard to break out of that mindset 23/ I harmed myself &amp; my husband by saying yes so many times at the beginning of our marriage when I really didn't want to. I thought I was sinning if I refused him sex, &amp; so I forced myself to try. he struggles to trust my yes now, &amp; I struggle to not resent his asking 24/ when I am able to muster up a bit of sex drive &amp; we're able to get past all the other baggage surrounding sex, I am unable to communicate DURING sex. I often feel disembodied, unable to speak or make any noise at all, unable to tell him what I like or dislike bc I DON'T KNOW 25/ how am I supposed to know how I like to be pleasured when I was never supposed to touch myself? when I still feel dirty touching myself? when, even though it's now \"okay,\" my body feels like a minefield &amp; touching or thinking the wrong thing will give me a panic attack? 26/ to circle back a little, I was also pressured to marry young simply by virtue of the culture I was in. \"it is better to marry than to burn with passion,\" &amp; I was expected to become a wife &amp; mother anyway. I am forever grateful that Jared has grown alongside me &amp; we fit well 27/ I was told that romance &amp; \"true love\" would turn into sexual desire, that I didn't need to worry about sexual compatibility or attraction bc it would fall into place if I followed the rules &amp; stayed pure. turns out, I'm not all that sexually attracted to my husband 🙃 28/ I'm gonna end this for now, but I really could probably write an entire book about how purity culture harmed me &amp; fucked up my life (bc I don't wanna hear how my sexuality isn't a big deal &amp; my marriage should be able to function well despite all this) 29/ this experience isn't uncommon. there are SO MANY people who have been harmed by purity culture, &amp; if you want to tell your story too, feel free to quote tweet or reply! I'll end by linking some resources if you want to better understand the trauma that is purity culture 30/ everything @samanthapfield writes about purity culture is fantastic https://t.co/UHWTY4GCFf 31/ highly recommend @TinaSSellers book &amp; blog, here's a good starting point https://t.co/5PprWHTnmM 32/ over at @lovejoyfeminism there are SO MANY posts to help you understand purity culture &amp; the harm it does https://t.co/4yyejnHJQ4 33/ there's an entire Tumblr dedicated to publishing stories from those who came out of the purity culture associated with \"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\" https://t.co/XsiBmHLM78 34/ speaking of IKDG, even the author has acknowledged the harm his ideas did &amp; is creating a documentary about it https://t.co/Lz0jT7j5CU 35/ so, @meekinsfam, there's the sparknotes version of how purity culture has fucked up my life &amp; some resources, but feel free to ask any clarifying questions end/","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"538588227"},"id_str":"538588227","name":"Carissa Nicole Winn🌔","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"2022"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"851"},"created_at":"Tue Mar 27 21:40:56 +0000 2012","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"12135"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"36"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"375"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"5314"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"3"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"10"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"148"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"0.84113"},"all_hashtags":["purityculture","Exvangelical","ChurchToo"],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Disgust"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"1"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e818419e"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"384"},"texto":"All right. I just finished the Mueller Report. I'm going to combine the most shocking and important revelations in one thread. Long and short: there was collusion, there was obstruction, Donald Trump needs to be removed from office. Immediately. 1/ Mueller found that Russia was actively interested in electing Trump president, as early as his announcement, if not earlier. Operations began just as Trump Campaign took off. Obvious the two are parallel organizations that occasionally worked together, had the same goals. 2/ Multiple members of the Trump Campaign were approached by Russia. They were receptive sometimes, other times they just proceeded with knowledge that Russia was interfering on their behalf. They were not ignorant of the fact that Russia was interfering, not at all. 3/ Trump and Cohen continued work on Trump Tower Moscow deal while actively misleading the public as to whether he had business in Russia. He knowingly lied to the American public while Cohen worked with people who seemingly thought the hotel and the election were intertwined. 4/ Perhaps the most critical piece of information is that the Trump Campaign knew that the DNC emails were going to be released before they were. They had an active, multi-pronged plan in place to capitalize off the communications stolen by the Russian government. 5/ Mueller found that Donald Trump, himself, knew that Wikileaks had the DNC emails before they were released and was in contact with campaign members and people outside of campaign and planned how to capitalize off their release. 6/ Trump's call for Russia to find Clinton's emails was fruitful. Within hours they followed his call and worked to find them. Despite saying it was just a TV stunt, he repeated the call off-camera. It was collusion in real time and in the light of public. No other way to say it 7/ As for the Trump Tower meeting, Mueller believed that Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner committed crimes, but worried that courts would lose the thread on legal definition of the crime and wasn't sure what the $ value of Clinton dirt was and if it was enough. 8/ Paul Manafort was especially lousy in the collusion front. He obviously had financial incentive and discussed battleground states with Russian individual, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, leading to suspicion that there were targeted efforts or interference. 9/ Manafort discussing battleground states with Russia is really, really unsettling. There's a ton of new ground here to cover and who knows what it led to and what can be proven. You could make an argument that this is possible what turned the election. 10/ In terms of obstruction, it is quite obvious that Mueller was communicating that there were SEVERAL instances of obstruction, SEVERAL instances of attempted obstruction, and that Congress should address the issue. 11/ Trump actively wanted Mueller out of the investigation, said as much repeatedly. He wanted to fire him and worried that his appointment would be \"the end\" of his presidency. 12/ Trump repeatedly told his subordinates to obstruct justice. He had them contact the principals, including Comey and Flynn, in order to take their temperature and communicate what Trump thought. It was a giant game of illegal telephone. 13/ Trump repeatedly would call Comey, take his temperature, and try and get him to take it easy on Flynn. He had Reince Priebus contact Flynn, take his temperature, seemingly try and work him in order to keep his loyalty. 14/ Multiple people in Trump's orbit declined to perform actions they thought were obstruction, including Chris Christie, who counseled Trump on how to not obstruct justice and watched him do it anyway. 15/ After it was revealed that Mike Flynn had illicit contact with Russia, Trump shook his hand and told him he'd be taken care of. It seems as if the exchange was a promise that Trump would help him with the fallout. 16/ Trump continually and actively addressed those in his orbit to either lie or coverup what they'd done wrong. He was constantly worried people would roll on him and constantly sought to get their stories straight in case of investigation. 17/ In a bizarre situation, Trump said outloud that he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him. He said he believed the AG position wasn't independent. He wanted an individual who would \"protect him\" and wouldn't mind keeping him illegal informed of investigations 18/ Trump knew that false testimony had been provided, particularly in Cohen's case. He was aware of a crime being committed and allowed it. 19/ Trump wanted to obstruct even more than he did, but the only thing keeping him from doing so was that those around him didn't want to be accessories to a crime. Don McGahn said he wanted him to do \"crazy shit\" and refused. 20/ Now, the big, big, big takeaways. Mueller wrote this report in such a way as to send a message that the investigation was not the end all be all of this matter. It's obvious he was keenly aware that there was still much work to do in regards to both collusion and obstruction 21/ In collusion, Mueller repeatedly mentions that he was hindered by the Trump team either lying or else not providing information. He said they destroyed evidence and stonewalled him. That's why he couldn't establish the charge in totality. 22/ In terms of obstruction, Mueller was clearly putting the matter in the hands of Congress. This is a full and explicit layout of impeachable, high crimes. He was not intending Barr to steamroll over this thing. Not at all. 23/ What's more, Barr not only lied, it appears he actively obstructed justice by misrepresenting the report in his summary. This wasn't just a partisan structuring, it was an attempt to try and save Donald Trump and the administration. 24/ What William Barr did here is beyond disgusting and beyond shameful. He should be removed from office and there should be ramifications. This is, to put it bluntly, a massive and indefensible act of cover-up a systematic and overwhelming crime. 25/ The Trump Campaign and the Trump Organization are criminal enterprises. The only difference between them and the infamous \"mob\" is that their crimes are explicitly white collar and international in nature. They acted with an intention to commit crimes, over and over. 26/ It's impossible to read this report and not notice how careful they were to skirt the line of collusion and obstruction. They were obviously aware of what they were doing and that this is even a matter of discussion is an indictment of our political and judicial system. 27/ This last thing, I want to preface by saying I don't say this lightly. It makes me unbelievably sad and depressed that this has happened. But we have a criminal president and he must be removed. It has to happen. 28/ From the moment Donald Trump announced his campaign he engaged in one unethical and criminal act after another. It's in black and white that he and the people around him are happy traitors who put their wealth and power above the country's wellbeing. 29/ Trump and his cronies made a decision to put power and wealth above the country. They actively sought help in undermining our democratic process. They didn't report constant Russian contacts or offers to help. They're traitors. That's it. They're traitors. 30/ We can sit here and parse out legal definitions, but I don't know how you get to anything else. We can talk about the word collusion or obstruction, but they actively sought help from a foreign adversary to interfere in the election of the Presidency of the United States. 31/ The House of Representatives must vote to impeach Donald Trump. I don't care if it won't carry out in the Senate. It's what impeachment exists to do. It's their constitutional obligation to impeach him for high crimes. 32/ Republicans have a duty to remove Donald Trump from office. They can hide behind partisanship all they want, but it's right here in the open that he's betrayed the company and broken the laws. They need to realize that duty is higher than party. And it needs to happen now. 33/ We are in a crisis. We have to recognize that. Right now, we have a criminally compromised president. If he's allowed to get through this unscathed, we're never, ever going back. This is a four-alarm fire and we have to treat it as such. Right. Now. 34/ There's no defending this. There's no spinning it. There's no rebuttal that can put this away. This is a massive and unbelievable crime on a scale before unseen. We need to get rid of the Trump Presidency before it destroys us, before it rots us from the inside out. 35/ I take literally no pleasure from this. I'm extremely, extremely disheartened that a crime like this could take place on a scale this large. I really, really wish this would've been a hoax or a witch hunt, but it's massive in scope and consequence. Trump has to go. 36/36","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"325385270"},"id_str":"325385270","name":"Jared Yates Sexton","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"175630"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3669"},"created_at":"Tue Jun 28 06:18:19 +0000 2011","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"27090"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"36"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"91842"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"324651"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"2551"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"9018"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.14896"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Sadness","Joy"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"7"}}

(it was of his own composition and entitled \"silver's the blood of the moon, the moon\".) by 11.48 we had made substantial headway. our excavation had taken us well beneath the poetry section's dais around half eleven we reached a layer of concrete. the old man swung his pick mightily, but when he heard the sound it made stepped back, startled. \"hollow!\" he cried. \"strange doings here. ready with the shovel, boy\". i was unsure about this demotion but stood ready all the same we broke the layer with a crash - he was a remarkable worker with his pick - and when the dust had settled an astonishing sight confronted us. we were looking down what appeared to be an ancient flight of stairs (\"roman\", my companion whispered), at the bottom of which an underground stream stretched away. the steps terminated in a stone wharf, where an old but sturdy boat was chained to a iron hoop \"a lantern! quick\". i dashed upstairs for one. \"gayle have you seen the lantern\", i asked, but she was busy with a customer. it was not in the top drawer nor in the footwell under the till. i didn't know where it was \"we definitely *had* a lantern, didn't we\" i asked. \"yes we definitely did\", said gayle. \"i remember putting it away before the danny dorling event. have you looked in the cupboard under the stairs?\" \"i was getting tote bags from there this morning and i didn't see it\" i said by this time natalia had come upstairs. \"natalia have you seen the bookshop lantern?\" asked gayle. \"hmmm. i think i did see it recently\", said natalia. \"is it on the post shelf?\" i ran down to take a look but it wasn't on the post shelf. \"it must be somewhere\", i said \"excuse me, are you looking for a lantern?\" said a helpful customer. \"there's one on the floor under the new fiction table\". \"so there it is\", i said and ran back downstairs with it. the old man was sat in the boat and tapping his ancient feet impatiently the single oar was rotten, but it hardly mattered - it was easier to propel the boat by pushing the oar against the stone. i drove us forward while the old man sat in the boat's prow holding the lantern, rigid as a figurehead for a while there was nothing but the sound of wood scraping on stone. finally the old man spoke. \"what do you see\". i looked around. \"the passage is widening slightly?\" i suggested. he nodded. \"there's another wharf there\", he said. \"let's tie up the boat\" he left the lantern resting in the boat as we stepped from it. when something crunched beneath my feet i reached back for it, and the lantern's beam fell onto a jumble of human bones. i started back but the old man laid a reassuring hand on my shoulder \"these dry bones are all that remains of the last men who dug here\", he explained. \"they can't hurt us now. press on, and with good heart! lanterns ahead!\" we followed the passage until we came to a curious door. it seemed to be operated by a strange runic contraption to its right; but in the event, it was standing propped open. a staircase extended away beyond it. i quickly sketched the arrangement on some till roll https://t.co/sh6Y8uICj4 \"nothing we've seen yet has alarmed me\", said my companion slowly. \"but this door alarms me. who left it open? when, and for what purpose? dim the light, boy, and let's tread soft, for i like this not\" as we crept upstairs, i began to share the old man's misgivings. an occasional flicker betrayed a light ahead of us, and we could hear sounds - a steady tapping, like a marble against glass, and more unnerving still, what might have been low voices somewhere ahead we came to a ledge and a ladder. by now the light and low voices were palpable. i rested a little while to sketch the arrangement, then me and the old man crept forward on our bellies to assess our situation. https://t.co/bYcNsrdZFj we could hear two voices very distinct. \"damn you, captain blake\", said the first roughly, \"and damn your tales of silver. i didn't sign on with you to labour down some sewer like a navvy. where's this famous jade skull you promised, eh?\" the second voice responded in an insinuating purr. \"while i'm captain, dick, you'll do as i say. wasn't it all as the bald man's chart predicted? didn't that lead us, plain as day, to the cataract and the hidden door? stow your tongue, then, dick burstock, stow your tongue\" the old man crouching by me was trembling with excitement. \"smugglers!\" he whispered fiercely, on what seemed to me very inadequate evidence the old man signalled with a flick of his wrist, we dropped back a little to talk through our next steps. \"the captain mentioned a bald man's chart\", said the old man. \"we need to get our hands on that chart. i'll make a distraction, boy; then hie you to the captain's trunk\" without waiting for my reply, he dipped for a stone; then flung it, with more force than i'd imagined he was capable of. captain blake was standing alongside an antique candelabra, its top candles lit - all three candles went flying into the straw. the captain roared that was my signal. ducking through the shadows, i ran past capt. blake and dick burstock battling furiously with the flames, up to the captain's concealed trunk. luckily it had been left unlocked. buried in the linings was the chart we sought. i tried to run back the way i came. but dick burstock had turned from the fire to find water, and caught sight of my shirt-tails. \"Oi!\" he screamed, running to intercept me. my escape cut off, i doubled back, vaulting a pair of barrels and diving down a passageway the furious dick burstock was in hot pursuit; but luck of a sort was with me. i collided with a lever, which sent a portcullis tumbling down to block his path. i was away, and i had the chart, but i was cut off from my guide and in a strange place having no lantern i guided myself with my phone's torch; aware, however, that the battery would not last long. \"if there's a path upwards i'll take it\", i thought, and hummed a verse of 'silver's the blood of the moon, the moon' but the passageway showed no signs of turning upwards, although it seemed to widen, and the stonework seemed to become rougher. stranger still, i could hear a sound which reminded me of a tide lapping the shore. i rounded a corner and a curious sight indeed confronted me it was what i can only describe as the strand of an underground ocean. the roof of the passageway suddenly lifted up very substantially; high up in it, I could see veins of silver picked out like constellations. the water stretched away further than i could see. hauled up onto the shore was a sailing vessel, a death's head flag hoisted from the mizzen-mast. \"so it was this which carried captain blake and dick burstock here\", i said to myself. there was a campfire smouldering alongside the boat; i moved the teakettle into place above it. i needed to think carefully. my intention was to push out in the boat and seek a further shore. but what were my responsibilities to the old man? if he hadn't been discovered, would he be able to make his own way back down the passage to our \"diggins\", and from thence the shop? and then, what if he *had* been discovered? surely it was my responsibility to assist him. but how? the knife on captain blake's belt proclaimed him a deft close-quarters opponent; i had no weapon, and doubted my strength. \"what would gayle do\", i wondered there was another consideration; if i went back and rescued the old man, it seemed inevitable that blake and burstock would be able to regain the boat. this, perhaps, was our only chance to get a jump on the ruffians. \"forgive me, old man\", i whispered as i pushed off the boat having made my decision, i explored the boat. there were two cabins; one, cramped and filthy, clearly belonged to the wretched burstock; the other, velveteen and luxurious, to none other than captain blake. i stowed my gear in the captain's cabin and headed up to take the wheel a very large nugget of silver in the \"roof\" - some hundred metres above me - provided enough light to steer by. i hoisted the mainsail and the prow cut through the water, crisp and easy i set my course in the direction which seemed most promising, and then unfurled the bald man's chart. i could plainly see the 'cataract' and the 'hidden door' the captain had mentioned. more puzzling was the sketch in the bottom corner of an ominous creature https://t.co/36HdoJ8obX","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"14849266"},"id_str":"14849266","name":"LRB Bookshop","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"40198"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"3384"},"created_at":"Tue May 20 22:08:41 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"28758"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"39"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"215"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1582"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"6"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"41"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.01648"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Sadness"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Surprise","Fear"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"2"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e81841a1"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"387"},"texto":"Let’s talk about Russia, because I think there’s a real cultural difference in how we in the West understand surveillance and what’s actually happening with Russian efforts so we have a hard time believing the depth of what’s going on. My parents are diplomats and they were posted to Russia. Before they left they deleted all social media and told my sister and I that the Russians would be watching us. My mum does property management stuff and my dad does tech and communications stuff. It sounds fancy, but basically my dad is the guy that you call when your printer isn’t working, and he does things like make sure firewalls are up and people are trained on new software. Mum figures out who’s gonna live where and gets them their furniture. Not high ranking stuff. One day mum looked up and saw a new smoke detector in the bedroom of their apartment in Moscow. Since she’s the property person, she would’ve known about a new smoke detector being installed in anyone’s unit. She would’ve organized it. This one was different from the others. It appeared magically. She had never organized this new smoke detector. There was no reason for it to be there. Cause it was installed by Russian surveillance. It wasn’t a smoke detector. Except at this point they’re so used to it she’s like “ugh, spies. Whatever.” One of her juniors came home early to her apartment one day to find four dudes sitting around her kitchen table playing cards. They wouldn’t talk when she asked who they were. They packed up and left and one of them shrugged at her on the way out. Another woman who worked with her got upset about her clothes in her dresser always being messed up when she knew she folded them. One day she said outloud “if you guys are gonna spy on me can’t you at least tidy up or something?” Next day when she came home her dishes were done. On the internet in 1998-1999 Russian citizens were generally very democratic and varied. In 2000 suddenly 60-80% of comments reflected totalitarian views. This is attributed to “web brigades” formed by the Russian State Security Service. Oh, you need historical context for this to really sink in. Putin was first named Prime Minister in August 1999, he was unpopular and not well known. A bunch of apartments were bombed and it was blamed on the Chechens. Putin used this to position himself as a strong leader. Yeltsin (Russian President at the time) announces his resignation on New Year’s Eve 1999. Putin is acting President up until the election in March. Putin ran almost no campaign and received 1/3 of all the media coverage, though there were 12 candidates for president. He won. Putin is President from 2000-2008. Then he goes back to being Prime Minister until 2012, then he goes back to being President. Before all this he was a foreign intelligence officer until 1991 when he entered politics. He became Director of the Federal Security Service in 1998. Federal Security Service (FSB) is responsible for internal security of the Russian state, counterintelligence, terrorism, etc. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies work under the FSB if necessary. So back to those web brigades in 2000. Organized and overseen by Russian State Security, also known as the FSB. Also known as the successor to the KGB. Also known as the agency that Putin just reformed before becoming Prime Minister and then acting President 4 months later. In 2012 a Russian hacktivist group publishes a bunch of emails belonging to a pro-Kremlin group including a number of government officials. Journalists discover that the pro-Kremlin group has been paying people to post comments, content, hijack blog ratings, etc. In 2013 Freedom House reports that 22 of 60 countries use paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions. Russia is at the forefront of this and has been for several years. https://t.co/XxtMQd2aQq Also in 2013 independent Russian journalists investigate the Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people at this time. The IRA hires young people to write pro-Kremlin stuff and smear US politics and culture. https://t.co/cnACLI7Tjl Through 2014-2015, journalists investigate troll armies as the Ukraine conflict escalates. One account found a twitter network of over 20,000 fake twitter accounts to spam negative comments about Ukraine. https://t.co/yHvOTCZ5pn In 2014 Russia expands its System of Operational-Investigatory Measures (SORM) laws to include social media activity. All telecommunications companies already have to track, record and store telephone, email and web browsing activity. This adds social media. Also in 2014 Russia passes the “Bloggers law”. Bloggers with over 3,000 daily readers are required to register and cannot be anonymous online. All orgs that provide platforms (like search engines, social networks, forums) must maintain computer records on Russian soil of everything posted in the past 6 months. Yes that means, Facebook, Skype, Google and Twitter. Also in 2014 public internet can no longer be anonymous. Anyone operating a public wi-fi network must identify users by their passport. This information must be stored for 6 months. In 2016 the Yarovaya Law is signed, Internet Service Providers must also track and store data according to the bloggers law AND disclose this data and “all information necessary” to authorities on request without a warrant or court order. In 2017 VPNs are banned in Russia. In 2018 online messenger services that allow unidentified users are banned in Russia. In 2018 messenger, email and social networks that allow encrypted data must allow the FSB to read encrypted messages without a court order. Here's a nice simplified table to show Russian interference in countries that aren't just the US. https://t.co/ifv6fPbpqN https://t.co/iT2fuZidhX Other things we know Russian web brigades have worked on include: Star Wars: The Last Jedi https://t.co/mFEin8IqeU Russia trolls and bots are also part of the anti-vaccine rhetoric: https://t.co/sKLJnwFVSV Russian trolls and bots got in on the Ford-Kavanaugh discussion: https://t.co/04MKBJTFiy Russian trolls and bots on Syria, Obama, Black Lives Matter, and fortune telling! https://t.co/Tt95UXghCx Russia is getting into your Netflix queue. https://t.co/wKCTnP73bV Russia is on your pages, in your groups, in your comments. In 2016 and 2017 nearly 30 million people actually SHARED Russian propaganda. That's the population of Canada. https://t.co/oeAPspAUTF Russia and China are sitting with their fingers on the trigger to disrupt gas and electricity in the United States, right now. They can literally shut off the power. https://t.co/PdaebzD6cO Russian hackers, not to be confused with trolls, are 8 times faster than their closest adversary. https://t.co/20RnPv5vNm I’m starting to get messages and stories from others so I’ll link those now! https://t.co/ECjtOPWgJd Cultural differences. See? https://t.co/EHpQH0IwWp https://t.co/VF3ESUdtOK We tend to think of digital surveillance in the West from a capitalist perspective: “oh google just wants to know what kind of shoes I like so it can show me ads for shoes” That’s not what this is about. That’s not the ideology this kind of surveillance is built on. I realize that it seems impossible to talk about this stuff without sounding like a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, but I suggest we all just take a deep breath and put that fear aside because this is just the surface stuff that we KNOW about. Hey threadreaderapp folks, I see you. I’ll put this into a blog post for you to share but I’m blocking threadreaderapp from storing my threads. They’ll be removed from the system in about 15 mins. Sorry for the inconvenience. I’ll have something for you soon. I’m just one person and I try to keep an eye on where my words go and what’s done with them.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5d1917496b361d13e81841a2"},"hilo":{"$numberInt":"388"},"texto":"Thread: On @POTUS's Upcoming State Visit and the UK 1. There is much intrigue in the air as @POTUS’s state visit to the UK approaches. Will he pressure the Brits to come clean publicly on their #Spygate complicity? 2. Will the Queen attempt a “charm offensive” in order to persuade him to not release any declassified #Spygate-related information that may incriminate British intelligence? 3. I find it particularly interesting that the Conservative Party’s house organ, the Daily Telegraph, published an article to try to get out ahead of the #Spygate revelations before the state visit. &lt;quote&gt; 4. Theresa May’s spy chiefs were secretly briefed on an explosive dossier of claims about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia before the US president was made aware of its existence, The Telegraph can reveal. 5. The heads of MI5 and MI6 and one of Mrs. May’s most trusted security advisers were told about former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele’s memos on the Trump campaign in the weeks after his November 2016 election victory. &lt;unquote&gt; Source: https://t.co/26pOmXRpkJ 6. “The Telegraph can reveal.” Why do you supposed they waited until just last Sunday to publish this article when surely the facts were known months ago – if not from the very beginning? 7. Always remember: the UK Deep State has been at it MUCH longer that the US Deep State. They’ve perfected an “us-versus-them” mentality in a society that was never classless to begin with. The UK’s political class and Deep State are where our political class takes its clues. 8. The UK Deep State is globalist-minded; so is the American political class. The UK is for “free trade” at the expense of their own people; so is the American political class. The UK has “socialized medicine” – and the attendant shortages in care – for decades; …. 8A. … the American political class (esp. the Democrats) have pushed Obamacare down our throats as a waystation on the road to a US-version of government-run medicine. 9. The UK has been on the anthropogenic global warming bandwagon from the very beginning. That’s where many of the first bogus climate models and databases were developed to influence political discourse on the subject; the American political class has followed their lead. 10. The UK political class has been rolling over for the Muslim invasion for years due to foolishly handing out British passports to virtually anyone from the old British Empire; who can deny that that’s essentially what the American political class has been doing in recent yrs? 11. There are townships in the UK that are no-go zones in which Sharia law dictates local rules. Here is one consequence of that invasion: &lt;quote&gt; 12. The UK tops even Sweden in Europe’s sexual assault and rape statistics. At 130.96 per 100,000 for sexual assaults and 50.68 per 100,000 for rapes, the United Kingdom is the most dangerous place for women in Europe. 13. One analysis claims that 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted and that 3.1% of women were assaulted in just the last year. 14. But then why do the numbers for nearby Ireland look so strikingly different? Like Finland, Ireland’s numbers are high, but nowhere near as high as those in the United Kingdom. 15. The UK’s sexual assault and rape rates are roughly four times as high as those of Ireland. And at 6.3% versus 1.4%, the difference in Muslim population percentages is in almost perfect proportion. 16. London, with its great diversity, has the highest rape rate within the United Kingdom. &lt;unquote&gt; Read the rest here: https://t.co/nx1stLEdUK 17. We’re moving in that direction in Somali-controlled areas of St. Paul, MN. Ask yourself how in the world did their come to be 74,000 Somalis in the Twin Cities area in the middle of America – except by Deep State design? One consequence? Ilhan Omar! https://t.co/Zy9aUP6xIy 18. All the manifestations of the UK Deep State are mirrored and imitated by the American political class, including the implementation of double standards in the application of the rule of law, as well as the weaponization of government institutions against the people. 19. UK disdain for the US, as well as British meddling in US politics is not a new phenomenon. For example, Winston Churchill has been glorified in recent movies (The Darkest Hour is a really good picture, and Gary Oldman gave his best performance ever!). https://t.co/xXvCNhmN5h 20. But there is another side of Churchill that has been hidden from public view to perpetuate the myth – his deep-seated enmity toward the US. A recent biographer of his was the first person to gain access to King George VI's wartime diaries in the Royal Archives. &lt;quote&gt; 21. Although he had enjoyed his first trip to the United States in 1895, at age 20, Churchill’s initial attitude toward Anglo-American unity was sarcastic, bordering on the facetious. 22. In the 1920s, Churchill was highly critical of the United States’ determination to build a fleet equal in power and tonnage to the Royal Navy’s. 23. “There can really be no parity between a power whose navy is its life and a power whose navy is only for prestige,” he wrote in a secret cabinet memorandum in June 1927, while he was chancellor of the exchequer. 24. “It always seems to be assumed that it is our duty to humour the United States and minister to their vanity. They do nothing for us in return but exact their last pound of flesh.” 25. [H]is hostility to America was not known beyond the cognoscenti inside government, as he assiduously kept it out of his many speeches. 26. Churchill was clearly jealous of the leading position the Americans had assumed through their vastly superior production of war materiel by the spring of 1943. 27. “Winston is keen on an Imperial Conference,” the king noted that April, “so as to discuss the question of putting up a united British Commonwealth and Empire front to show the world and USA that we are one unity.” 28. “The Americans are always saying they are going to lead the postwar world.” &lt;unquote&gt; There is more here: https://t.co/ezjJJ3KdKp 29. This secret bias perhaps begins to explain Churchill's unqualified backing for the hyper-egotist and flaming asshole Field Marshal Montgomery against American Supreme Allied Commander GEN Dwight Eisenhower in major decision points for the prosecution of the War. 30. Churchill also appears to have had strong opinions about FDR’s socialist domestic politics and naive fondness for the \"heroic\" Stalin and the USSR. 31. Churchill also is controversial and less than fondly remembered by many Australians, who deeply resent the mass slaughter of their troops in Churchill's flawed strategy and incompetent execution of the Gallipoli campaign against the Turkish Straits in 1915. 32. Some Aussies to this day call senior levels of British military and political leadership \"Pompies\" – a diminutive pejorative for \"Pompous Assholes\" (or \"Buffoons\"). 33. The point of this is to remind us that the Brits may be long-standing allies, but they are not necessarily our friends. They have practiced realpolitick for centuries and are motivated by what best serves Britain (frequently at America’s expense!). 34. Getting back to @POTUS’s upcoming state visit, I have no doubt that the Brits wish to keep their intel agencies’ involvement in #Spygate secret, as that would blow the roof off both countries’ Deep State and political class collectives. 35. The Brit Deep State is trying desperately to keep the UK inside the EU, and an eruption of the complicity of UK intel agencies meddling in US politics would be an unwelcome diversion (to say the least!). 36. Prime Minister Theresa May has already been forced to resign (effective 7 June), and there are at least five candidates who are angling to be her replacement. I strongly believe that she will become the scapegoat for “UK Spygate” if/when the whole story goes public. 37. That will be her penance for having been the UK Deep State’s PM since 2016.

Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom. You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet. Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. “Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” - Archimedes Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement. Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching. You should be too busy to “do coffee,\" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you. Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"745273"},"id_str":"745273","name":"Naval","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"639997"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"675"},"created_at":"Thu Feb 01 23:05:04 +0000 2007","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"19695"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"40"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"70055"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"309913"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1751"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"7748"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.51599"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Fear","Joy"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Joy","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

(THREAD) Granted, it was to convince people to play Rach 2 in once-in-a-lifetime master classes, or learn to conduct La Cenerentola, but the tools were still what's available to everyone else. Unless, of course, you engage in illegal and unethical behavior. It's important that we understand what this all means, and that it's not just techie stuff for someone else to figure out. Before you let anyone poo-poo the Cambridge Analytica story (which I saw from a NEW YORK TIMES journo yesterday), here are some key things to remember: -Cambridge Analytica is a subsidiary of SCL group -SCL group was immediately given a huge contract with US Department of State following the inauguration. Contract was reportedly to fight ISIS via propaganda. -Mike Flynn was forced to update his FARA stating that he'd taken payments from SCL Group - shortly before he was indicted and pled guilty https://t.co/cay5ApTTFu -Facebook says it's not a data breach. They deliberately wrote their terms of service in such a way that it didn't qualify as such. They looked the other way when Cambridge Analytica illegally scraped the data of millions of us. And since they weren't calling it a breach, they didn't notify the authorities either, who would have seen their shit show and blew the lid off the whole operation. -The users on Facebook is their most valuable asset. It’s what advertisers pay billions for. We’re supposed to believe that they were okay with some rogue company having unauthorized access to 50 million of their users? Users in one of the richest countries in the world - prime targets for advertising dollars? That they were okay with them having access to this for YEARS? PLEASE. -Facebook was embedded in the campaigns (they helpfully offered this), working with the stolen data. Facebook knew when it was stolen, and they knew when they were working with this stolen data on behalf of Trump and others. They KNEW. (link to sourcing on above) https://t.co/CCXCBBf3LU -there is every reason to believe that the voter registration hacks, Equifax hacks, and god knows what else are related -Corey Lewandowski was in communication with Cambridge Analytica as early as 2015, before Trump had even announced. -servers at Trump Tower, Alfa Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Spectrum Health (owned by the DeVos family) were all in communication with each other and were the target of a FISA application in October of 2016 https://t.co/AOFbKsVbKw What a great way to move around illegally obtained data, and add even more illegally obtained data! -immediately following the election, Kushner gives an exclusive interview to Forbes, and the resulting article pushes the idea that Kushner's a boy wonder when it comes to social strategy, and gosh - they just figured things out on a shoestring budget, and look at them now! (here's the article) https://t.co/L8EAgTxLct -Trump won the electoral college by 70,000 well-placed votes With the kind of data they had available - data that was STOLEN - they weren't running ads along the lines of \"this person likes the Gap, Hamilton, and vacationing at the beach, and is probably liberal.” They were running ads disguised as news stories, linked to fake news sites + stories, and targeting along the lines of \"this person is located in this key voting district, has $17 in their bank account, is paranoid, has used the word n***er in their private FB messages, has talked about violence towards women in their comments, and hasn't worked in 2 years\". If they also had access to health data (which I think they did), they could target people with mental illness. Microtargeting is achieved by uploading a custom audience to the Facebook ad manager - meaning, after they've found all the ppl in say, Pennsylvania who've used the word n***er in their private messages, they separate these people from everyone else. Then they run ads targeting these people and only these people. They don't have to waste money casting a wide net and seeing what sticks. They already know what will stick. Then, with a pixel (basically, a tracker placed on a website), they can see if the person has visited the sites they've linked to. They could see if these people were sharing stories, liking, clicking, or commenting. And they could target these people over and over and over and over: because you can then create ANOTHER custom audience based on behaviors from your FIRST custom audience. They could have Trump coordinate his messaging in speeches with what was being run in these ads, and what was being covered on the news - all the news, not just Fox - 24/7 because, ratings. Remember how Trump kicked off his campaign with disgusting comments about Mexican human beings? What he said to Megyn Kelly on live TV? He was talking to his custom audience, all cued up in the Facebook ads manager, and ready to go. (by the way, people on the far left were targeted too) Continuing: they achieved social proof with an army of trolls and bots who made it look like many other people agreed with these extreme ideas, and look like the fake news was legitimate. The trolls and bots shared the links, made comments on fake and legitimate news articles. Trolls even created fake events and attempted to create situations in which violence would erupt (and then be covered extensively, and used to further push the narrative of ppl of color and/or on the left being thugs). Social proof was solidified, and Cambridge Analytica got to refine their stolen data even more, by luring vulnerable people into private groups where they could ask them questions and encourage them to take action. In the end, it was 70,000 people - people with a specific psychological profile, which they had access to because they'd stolen it - who swung key states. If you think this is impossible, consider that companies convince people on a daily basis to leave their homes and buy a $30,000 car. WITHOUT stolen data about the most intimate parts of their lives. And WITHOUT these people being afraid that their very lives depend on buying a car/going to McDonald's/shopping at Walmart-Mart. I'd posit that the rest were filled in by people who told everyone \"he doesn't mean what he's saying\" and stood to gain the most from what Trump was promising: rich, white straight men. And they just got what they were promised - a giant cash grab that goes against what every so-called conservative has said they believe in. And let's not forget the far religious right! See: Council for National Policy. There was a reason Trump had little to no ad spend in other areas of media, like TV. He didn't need it. They had a STOLEN profile of just about every single American - likely down to their bowel movements - and used those profiles to manipulate those who were vulnerable. So, in summary, this is a BFD. And it was only ONE of the things they were doing, as we're finding out. ||END|| Sorry, just wanted to add one more thing. This is another important question we need to ask: who ELSE has this data now? and WTF are they doing to us with it? If you haven't read or watched the stories, Facebook didn't ask CA to do anything about the stolen data until August of 2016 - YEARS after it had happened. Even then, they didn't follow up, AND the named source (Wylie) has stated that this data was EMAILED, UNENCRYPTED. Looks like the NRA works with Cambridge Analytica. What are they doing with this data? Who are they targeting? What are they convincing them to do? https://t.co/jbLo6roiO3","usuario":{"id":{"$numberInt":"16637487"},"id_str":"16637487","name":"Sara Danner Dukic","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"38621"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"781"},"created_at":"Tue Oct 07 21:34:19 +0000 2008","verified":false,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"13395"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"41"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"53961"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"137357"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"1316"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"3350"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"1.17816"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Fear"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Sadness"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"5"}}

And that's because it may have more to do with Trump advisor Erik Prince and Trump fundraiser/RNC deputy finance chair Elliott Broidy than we thought. Hope you'll read on and share. https://t.co/TGqLdgXmx9 1/ When Gates pleaded guilty, the White House insisted his crimes had nothing to do with Trump or Russia. But it's increasingly clear the reason Mueller offered Gates a plea deal did in fact have to do with Russia-related information Gates had about not just Manafort but others. 2/ First, understand how significant Gates was to Trump's campaign: he was its Deputy Campaign Manager; he ran its operations at the RNC, where Trump campaign aides made contact with Russian nationals and subsequently changed the RNC platform to benefit Putin and lied about it... 3/ ...per media reports, he was effectively running Trump's campaign—more so than Manafort—for several months in the summer of 2016; when Manafort was fired, Trump stayed in contact with his former Campaign Manager and declined to fire Gates, instead giving him a critical role... 4/ ...as his campaign's liaison to the RNC, a move which at the time surprised political observers because (a) that was a critical campaign role, and (b) it was assumed that Gates, Manafort's deputy, would've been removed from the campaign at the same time Manafort was because... 5/ ...like Manafort, Gates had ties to the Ukraine and therefore should've been as big a liability as Manafort was—by then—thought to be, at least publicly; Trump then made him Deputy Chairman of his inaugural committee (a key role) during the transition, which we now know was... 6/ ...lousy with secret meetings and calls with Russian nationals—even as Trump (and, one presumes, let's be honest, Gates as well) stayed in touch with Manafort behind the scenes (and of course Trump and Manafort lived in the same building and could meet up whenever they liked). 7/ So Gates was at the top of Trump's campaign and transition; was at the top of the campaign and transition at all points at which suspicious Trump-Russia contact occurred; and was definitively tied to that contact, at least in terms of the lied-about platform change at the RNC. 8/ But Trump's decision not to fire Gates in mid-2016, but put him in a key position as the link between himself and the RNC, never sat right with me, or with many others in the media. Gates came in with Manafort and had all the same liabilities; so why didn't he go out with him? 9/ Indeed, Trump responded to the *loss* of Manafort (against Trump's wishes, and only in public, to be clear) by *promoting* Manafort's equally compromised deputy to a position of even *greater* prominence and power than he had before—which he stayed in through the inauguration. 10/ And now Rick Gates has pleaded guilty. Immediately after that happened, sources in the White House successfully got the media to pass on (essentially without analysis) two lies: (a) Gates wasn't a particularly prominent Trump-campaign figure; (b) he'd no knowledge of Russia. 11/ But you know who Gates was linked up with as a result of Trump shocking the media and naming him his RNC liaison? The man pictured atop this thread, Elliott Brody, who less than 90 days after Gates ceased to be Trump's RNC liaison became the deputy finance chair of the RNC. 12/ Days after Gates was indicted, McClatchy reported Mueller was looking into new charges against Gates involving a shady film-production scheme. As part of that scheme, two producers sent $100K in fraudulently-obtained funds to a nonprofit run by Broidy. https://t.co/icEmpkKN2f 13/ That wasn't the first time Gates was involved with Broidy: Broidy was Vice Chairman of the Trump Victory Committee during the 2016 campaign, a joint operation between Trump and the RNC, which linkage therefore—per Trump's surprising summer promotion of Gates—was run by Gates. 14/ As soon as the campaign ended, Gates and Broidy continued working together, this time on Trump's inaugural committee—for which Broidy was the Vice Chairman and Gates the Deputy Chairman. So the compromised-by-Ukraine-cash Gates was hand in glove with Broidy for *many* months. 15/ And after he worked with the compromised-by-Ukraine-cash Gates for many months, Broidy was rewarded by the RNC with a promotion of his own—to deputy finance chairman. So Trump saw to Rick Gates' elevation, and the RNC saw to Broidy's. Both sides of that partnership prospered. 16/ Three weeks ago, a story dropped suggesting that Broidy's wife was trying to collect millions of dollars in return for influencing Trump Administration policy. https://t.co/G2LywcD580 17/ Two days later, the George Nader news dropped—Nader, a Trump insider-turned-Mueller-informant, established that Erik Prince had lied about his Trump-sanctioned secret meeting with a Russian in the Seychelles—and Nader was immediately tied to Broidy too.https://t.co/AAdmt9y45v 18/ Lest you wonder if Broidy is only connected to Nader, not Prince, understand first that Broidy is in the same niche industry as Prince—private Middle East military contractors—specifically in the UAE, which is where Prince lives. He's tied to the UAE royal family—like Prince. 19/ But wait! I'm just getting warmed up. Just four days after the Broidy-Nader scandal (which itself was two days after Broidy's wife's scandal), this bombshell dropped: Broidy was possibly connected to a scandal involving (wait for it) Russian sanctions. https://t.co/PEHVGrzchd 20/ According to docs held by a Ukrainian prosecutor, Broidy has been acting as an agent of a sanctioned Kremlin-owned bank—in other words, the Kremlin. And the media reports Broidy has \"significant access to Trump\" and is lobbying him. On what? Why, Russian sanctions, of course. 21/ That's right, Broidy appears to be lobbying Trump to do just what Trump has done: slow or avoid the imposition of any new Russian sanctions, and militate publicly for an end to all sanctions on Russian entities. Thank god there's no evidence that Broidy is giving Trump money! 22/ (Surely, if you're reading this, you know what's coming next.) 23/ Broidy has been a major Trump fundraiser since 2016, and the money sure didn't stop flowing once (allegedly) Broidy began working for both the RNC and—apparently—Putin's VTB Bank. One week ago Broidy hosted a $35,000-a-person fundraiser (!) for Trump. https://t.co/y995863cZw 24/ The Al-Jazeera investigation linked to in this thread implies that Mueller now could be investigating Broidy—who, again, apparently has shady ties to both the Kremlin, the RNC, Ukraine, Erik Prince, and the UAE—for FARA violations and more. And who could help him? Rick Gates. 25/ (I wish I could tell you this thread is about to get *less* complicated, but it's about to get *more* complicated. But also *absolutely stunning*.) 26/ Trump (and Jared) are surrounded by a horde of fundraisers and advisors who are trying to lobby Trump not just about private military contractors in the Middle East but, more significantly, about *nuclear power* in the Middle East. Specifically, gifts of U.S. nuclear tech. 27/ Rick Gates is part of that horde. And so is another man Mueller has in his pocket due to a plea: Michael Flynn. Trump pal Thomas Barrack is also in that horde. So is Bud McFarlane, who was a VIP at Trump's Mayflower Speech in April 2016. So is Broidy. https://t.co/5cxOxnfL0f 28/ So now we have a story involving Gates, Flynn, Prince, Broidy, Barrack, McFarlane, Kushner, Nader, and Donald Trump. But guess what: it all comes back to Russia and the UAE, the two parties Prince secretly met with and lied about meeting with while under oath before Congress. 29/ If you read the ProPublica story, you'll see the UAE can only get U.S. nuclear tech if we give it to Saudi Arabia first. Trump's pals are all either working to get that tech to Saudi Arabia or lobbying on behalf of the UAE—which, as to nuclear tech, amounts to the same thing. 30/ What does this have to do with Putin and sanctions? That's a reasonable question to ask.The answer: Moscow wants the contracts to build all new nuclear power plants in the Middle East, and stands to make *hundreds of millions* doing so. Just one thing stops them: sanctions. 31/ Yesterday the Saudi Crown Prince, who wants our nuclear tech, which would allow it to flow also to the UAE, which would make Putin hundreds of millions—but only if sanctions are dropped—said this about Jared Kushner: he's \"in my pocket.\" Process that. https://t.co/op1dN9MEM2 32/ Does this change your view of why Kushner secretly met the Russian ambassador at Trump Tower in December 2016—he smuggled him in the back door—to discuss setting up a secret backchanel to Putin? While Gates and Broidy were running the inaugural committee and lobbying Trump? 33/ Does this change your view of the pending (unanswered) question about where the \"extra\" tens of millions of dollars raised by Gates and Broidy for the inauguration went? https://t.co/qMTiAkPVRt 34/ Does this change your view of today's news about Broidy allegedly helping Moscow companies lobby Trump on sanctions? Does it change your view of whether Mueller wanted Gates under plea for reasons (as the White House says) entirely unrelated to Trump? https://t.co/uxrVkk6MoI 35/ Gates and Flynn have a lot to tell Mueller, and we should assume they've told all of it. We should further assume Broidy and Kushner are in Mueller's path and that at least one will roll on Trump. We should assume all pending UAE-Saudi Arabia scandals are equally about Putin. 36/ I've said this from the day I first read Chris Steele's dossier 14 months ago: Trump sold U.S. policy on Russia for money, and he did it before the campaign started (2013 in Moscow), during the campaign (his 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal) and while in office post-January 2017. 37/ Yesterday's big news from the New York Times is of course part of all this, as it underscores that Trump's clandestine arrangement with Moscow flowed (much if not all the time) through negotiations with the UAE and Saudi Arabia—often via his top aides. https://t.co/uGys0TGYdx 38/ Trump is toast. Not because he's an asshole, though he is; not because he's a Republican, which (in fact) he isn't; he's toast because he's one of the biggest traitors in the history of the U.S. and Mueller has *at least* three key witnesses *already* who can testify to that. 39/ Now you know why Trump hired Joe DiGenova—who wanted Comey prosecuted and will pull the same BS on Mueller. You know why he's hiring DiGenova's wife Victoria, who spread the Uranium One hoax—he's going to go after Clinton. You know why he hired Bolton—he's going to go to war. 40/ Trump knows he's toast, which is why he's preparing for two wars: a war on the rule of law here at home, and a senseless war abroad, in either North Korea or Iran. All of it is to save himself—he thinks—by delaying what at this point is inevitable: his fall from power. {end} UPDATE/ I was one of the louder voices online outlining why DiGenova and Toensing had too many conflicts to work with Trump—due to other Trump-Russia clients and DiGenova's alleged role in blackmailing Comey to reopen the Clinton case. Well, look at this: https://t.co/VRDLud9wg1 NOTE1/ What Joe DiGenova and his wife are learning, which most of us lawyers learned in law school, is that a client can waive an *apparent* conflict of interest, but an *actual* conflict of interest must be avoided by a lawyer at all costs—per the Rules of Professional Conduct. NOTE2/ Representing Clovis, Prince, and Corallo is an *actual* conflict of interest for DiGenova and his wife that can't be waived by the clients and can't be allowed by DiGenova and Toensing. Their clients (and they) have info on facts and strategy Trump wants and needs to know. NOTE3/ When I say Trump is \"toast,\" please (I ask you) do *not* add the word \"imminently\" after it in your mind—as I didn't say that and don't believe it and am sick of being misquoted. The writing is on the wall for Trump, but it'll take *many* months for this to come to a head.","usuario":{"id":{"$numberLong":"3223426134"},"id_str":"3223426134","name":"Seth Abramson","followers_count":{"$numberInt":"676351"},"friends_count":{"$numberInt":"38"},"created_at":"Fri May 22 16:19:26 +0000 2015","verified":true,"statuses_count":{"$numberInt":"53065"}},"total_tweets":{"$numberInt":"45"},"total_retweet":{"$numberInt":"31890"},"total_favorites":{"$numberInt":"81462"},"total_hashtags":{"$numberInt":"0"},"promedio_retweet":{"$numberInt":"709"},"promedio_favorites":{"$numberInt":"1810"},"puntaje_sigmoideo":{"$numberDouble":"2.25011"},"all_hashtags":[],"emocion_media":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_presente":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_moda":["Joy","Surprise"],"emocion_max":["Fear","Surprise"],"topico":{"$numberInt":"9"}}

Firtash's company planned to invest more than $100 million. https://t.co/J9MeiVewFW 📌Manafort’s partner on the deal was the former exclusive broker for Fred Trump's (Trump’s father) properties, Brad Zackson. 📌Firtash's investment company transferred $25 million into escrow to further the project. https://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi 📌Also in 2008, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, Semion Mogilevich, according to a classified DOS cable [released by WikiLeaks] https://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi 📌Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine. https://t.co/wX45ZbHVMt 📌Firtash was a major backer of Ukraine's Party of Regions, the pro-Russian party for which Manafort worked for many years. 📌Manafort's firm made more than $17M in gross revenue from the party in just two years, according to his recent FARA filing. https://t.co/6K47Mm8vQi ‼️Firtash - Boeing Dreamliner - Titanium Firtash has been wanted in Chicago since 2014 for his alleged role as the mastermind of an international titanium racket. https://t.co/lJWENJtECb 📌The case initially attracted int’l interest because of Firtash’s ties to Putin &amp; Mogilevich. 📌It is significant in light of Manafort’s indictment on charges of failing to register as an agent of former pro-Russian Fmr Ukrainian President Yanukovych, https://t.co/lJWENJtECb ‼️More Backstory: Firtash’s success was built on remarkable sweetheart deals brokered by associates of Russian leader Vladimir Putin (Semion Mogilevich) at an immense cost to Russian taxpayers, https://t.co/CWyqJiPQPY 📌Gazprom sold more than 20 billion cubic metres of gas well below market prices to Firtash over the past four years (since 2010) - about four times more than the Russian government has publicly acknowledged. https://t.co/CWyqJiPQPY 📌The price Firtash paid was so low, Reuters calculates, that companies he controlled made more than $3 billion on the arrangement. https://t.co/CWyqJiPQPY ‼️Titanium: The Cyprus offshore company Tolexis Trading Limited, part of Group DF owned by exiled Ukrainian billionaire Dmytro Firtash retains one of its most valuable assets, the Zaporizhzhya Titanium and Magnesium Combine. https://t.co/y9avtpCkkb 📌The only producer of titanium sponge in Ukraine and Europe is located in Zaporizhzhya, the provincial capital of 750,000 people located some 550 kilometers southeast from Kyiv. 📌Ergo Firtash [Mogilevich) controls the entire Titanium market. https://t.co/y9avtpCkkb In 2013, under the era of corrupt President Viktor Yanukovych, a Firtash ally, the state-owned Zaporizhzhya combine was privatized &amp; became a limited liability company. Firtash’s biz empire, enlarged during the reign of Yanukovych, remains largely intact. https://t.co/y9avtpCkkb 📌While a 51 percent stake was still owned by the state, the remaining 49 percent was transferred to Firtash’s Tolexis Trading Limited, which won at that time the competition organized by the State Property Fund of Ukraine. https://t.co/y9avtpkJsD Under the terms of the signed contract, Firtash’s company had to contribute $110 million to the authorized capital of the plant solely for its modernization. But as it turned out, that did not happen https://t.co/y9avtpCkkb The investigation found that despite the fact that during 2014-2015 Tolexis Trading Limited allocated $110M to the combine, only $1.2M , went for modernization. 📌The rest was allegedly withdrawn through offshore accounts, as the Ukrainska Pravda https://t.co/y9avtpCkkb 📌On March 12, 2019 the Supreme Court of Ukraine was about to make a final decision. However, the judge took a break until March 15, and then took a sick leave before ultimately making the decision in favor of the oligarch.🤔 https://t.co/y9avtpCkkb 📌Boeing -Titanium Boeing was in a tight spot. Just as it was preparing to roll out its innovative 787 Dreamliner, the plane that was supposed to lead the Boeing into the future — a shortage of strong but lightweight titanium parts threatened production. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw In 2006, as titanium prices rose, Boeing asked McKinsey &amp; Company to evaluate a proposal, potentially worth $500 million annually, to mine titanium in India through a foreign partnership financed by an influential Ukrainian oligarch—Firtash. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw 📌McKinsey says it advised Boeing of the risks of working with Firtash and recommended “character due diligence.” 📌McKinsey described what it said was the potential partner’s strategy for winning mining permits. It included bribing Indian officials. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw Firtash’s plan McKinsey noted, “respect traditional bureaucratic process including use of bribes.” McKinsey also wrote that the partner had identified 8 “key Indian officials” named in the PP slide, whose influence was needed for the deal to go through. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw 📌Nowhere in the PowerPoint slide did McKinsey advise that such a scheme would be illegal or unwise. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw The story of McKinsey’s role in the episode has remained hidden from public view for 12 years. The firm’s ultimate recommendation and how its client, Boeing, responded remain something of a mystery, cloaked in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw 📌When Boeing went looking for titanium in 2006, it tentatively agreed to buy the metal through a company controlled by Mr. Firtash, who had made billions of dollars brokering gas sales to Ukraine from Russia and former Soviet republics. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw 📌The deal did not end well. The mining venture never materialized, but Mr. Firtash was indicted on charges of directing $18.5 million in bribes to Indian officials for mining permits. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw Chicago feds recently revealed the tantalizing detail that they have “thousands of intercepts” of Firtash and his alleged co-conspirators in the titanium scheme. https://t.co/lJWENJtECb Adding to his revelation that the U.S. secretly recorded a phone call in which Firtash discussed a co-defendant's trip to Chicago to meet with Boeing executives, https://t.co/lJWENJtECb Bhachu said the government has \"tens of thousands\" of documents and \"thousands of intercepts\" that can be used against Firtash. https://t.co/lJWENJtECb Neither McKinsey nor Boeing have been charged in the case, and Boeing has not been accused of paying bribes. But several employees of the two companies are believed to have testified before a grand jury. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw ‼️The Hunt for Titanium Titanium is a strategic defense material, managed under law by the DOD &amp; its use &amp; procurement is subject to US defense mandates &amp; laws https://t.co/ObyiB9W4Th ‼️Uses of titanium sponge? * Landing gear, springs, rotors (helicopter), fittings, and attachments * Structural components for airplanes, satellites, and spacecraft * Gas turbine engines * Chemical processing https://t.co/ObyiB9W4Th https://t.co/z3dMl1daIV 🌳The Fight to Extradite In June 2013, a federal grand jury in Chicago secretly indicted Mr. Firtash and five others, including an Indian official, on bribery charges. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw Until a Russian billionaire, Vasily Anisimov, posted Firtash’s $174 million bond. Mr. Anisimov is an associate of Mr. Putin’s friend Arkady Rotenberg. So began a highly unusual four-year tug of war between two allies — the United States and Austria. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw Extradition requests between the United States and other Western nations are almost never rejected, said Lanny J. Davis, one of Mr. Firtash’s (&amp; Michael Cohen’s) lawyers and a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton. https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw 🚩Oct 2018: The European Union’s top court turned away an appeal by Dmytro Firtash, the latest twist for the Ukrainian oligarch whose extradition from Austria the United States has been fighting for since his 2014 arrest in Vienna. https://t.co/VdFYx7AE83 Dan Webb, one of Mr. Firtash’s lawyers and a former United States attorney in Chicago, said his client had nothing to do “with the creation or presentation of the PP slide proposing bribery and used by U.S. prosecutors to support extradition of Firtash.” https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw For its part, Boeing said in a statement that it had cooperated with the Justice Department and was “not accused of any wrongdoing.” https://t.co/19L5fMIxyw 📌Side note: Russia’s VSMPO-Avisma (https://t.co/V0FgmOutY8), the world’s largest titanium producer, and U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N) have launched a new manufacturing unit in Russia’s Urals region of Sverdlovsk https://t.co/0pTiEzRmLb ‼️Firtash Order Unsealed 6/21/19 Motions to dismiss DENIED.
